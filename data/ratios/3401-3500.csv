3401,Cost-effectiveness of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis in France,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in France. METHODS: We used a decision tree to evaluate, from a society's perspective, the cost of PEP per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. We used 1999-2003 PEP surveillance data and literature-derived data on per event transmission probabilities, PEP efficacy and quality of life with HIV. HIV prevalence and lifetime cost of HIV/AIDS management in the HAART era were derived from French studies. We assumed that mean life expectancy in full health was 65 years among uninfected individuals and that the mean survival time after HIV infection was 22.5 years. The costs of PEP drugs and follow-up were derived from the French public sector. A 3% annual rate was used to discount future costs and effects. RESULTS: During 1999-2003, PEP was prescribed to 8958 individuals (heterosexual sex: 47.6%; homosexual sex: 28.4%; occupational exposure: 23.4%; drug injection: 0.6%); of those, 2143 were exposed to a known HIV-infected source. PEP was estimated to prevent 7.7 infections and saved 64.5 QALY at a net cost of euro 5.7 million, resulting in an overall cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 88,692 per QALY saved. PEP was cost saving for 4.4% of cases and cost effective (< euro 50,000 per QALY) in a further 11.3% of cases. In contrast, 72 and 52% of prescriptions had a cost-effectiveness ratio exceeding euro 200,000 and euro 2 millions, respectively, per QALY saved. CONCLUSION: Overall, the French PEP programme is only moderately cost effective. PEP guidelines should be revised to target high-risk exposures better.",2006-01-02482,16931940,AIDS,Magid Herida,2006,20 / 13,1753-61,No,16931940,"Magid Herida; Christine Larsen; Florence Lot; Anne Laporte; Jean-Claude Desenclos; Françoise F Hamers; Cost-effectiveness of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis in France, AIDS, 2006-Aug-22; 20(13):0269-9370; 1753-61",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,"HIV Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) program of medications, lab tests, and counseling",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,20077,Euro,2002,27306.05

3408,Cardiovascular disease prevention with a multidrug regimen in the developing world: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, with 80% of cases occurring in developing countries. We therefore aimed to establish whether use of evidence-based multidrug regimens for patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease would be cost-effective in low-income and middle-income countries. METHODS: We used a Markov model to do a cost-effectiveness analysis with two combination regimens. For primary prevention, we used aspirin, a calcium-channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and a statin, and assessed them in four groups with different thresholds of absolute risks for cardiovascular disease. For secondary prevention, we assessed the same combination of drugs in one group, but substituted a beta blocker for the calcium-channel blocker. To compare strategies, we report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), in US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). FINDINGS: We recorded that preventive strategies could result in a 2-year gain in life expectancy. Across six developing World Bank regions, primary prevention yielded ICERs of US746-890 dollars/QALY gained for patients with a 10-year absolute risk of cardiovascular disease greater than 25%, and 1039-1221 dollars/QALY gained for those with an absolute risk greater than 5%. ICERs for secondary prevention ranged from 306 dollars/QALY to 388 dollars/QALY gained. INTERPRETATION: Regimens of aspirin, two blood-pressure drugs, and a statin could halve the risk of death from cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients. This approach is cost-effective according to WHO recommendations, and is robust across several estimates of drug efficacy and of treatment cost. Developing countries should encourage the use of these inexpensive drugs that are currently available for both primary and secondary prevention.",2006-01-02485,16920473,Lancet,Thomas A Gaziano,2006,368 / 9536,679-86,No,16920473,"Thomas A Gaziano; Lionel H Opie; Milton C Weinstein; Cardiovascular disease prevention with a multidrug regimen in the developing world: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Lancet, 2006-Aug-19; 368(9536):0140-6736; 679-86",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Combination of 81mg aspirin, 40mg lovastatin, 10mg lisinopril and metoprolol",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,336,United States,2001,491.02

3413,Cardiovascular disease prevention with a multidrug regimen in the developing world: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, with 80% of cases occurring in developing countries. We therefore aimed to establish whether use of evidence-based multidrug regimens for patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease would be cost-effective in low-income and middle-income countries. METHODS: We used a Markov model to do a cost-effectiveness analysis with two combination regimens. For primary prevention, we used aspirin, a calcium-channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and a statin, and assessed them in four groups with different thresholds of absolute risks for cardiovascular disease. For secondary prevention, we assessed the same combination of drugs in one group, but substituted a beta blocker for the calcium-channel blocker. To compare strategies, we report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), in US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). FINDINGS: We recorded that preventive strategies could result in a 2-year gain in life expectancy. Across six developing World Bank regions, primary prevention yielded ICERs of US746-890 dollars/QALY gained for patients with a 10-year absolute risk of cardiovascular disease greater than 25%, and 1039-1221 dollars/QALY gained for those with an absolute risk greater than 5%.

We therefore aimed to establish whether use of evidence-based multidrug regimens for patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease would be cost-effective in low-income and middle-income countries. METHODS: We used a Markov model to do a cost-effectiveness analysis with two combination regimens. For primary prevention, we used aspirin, a calcium-channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and a statin, and assessed them in four groups with different thresholds of absolute risks for cardiovascular disease. For secondary prevention, we assessed the same combination of drugs in one group, but substituted a beta blocker for the calcium-channel blocker. To compare strategies, we report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), in US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). FINDINGS: We recorded that preventive strategies could result in a 2-year gain in life expectancy. Across six developing World Bank regions, primary prevention yielded ICERs of US746-890 dollars/QALY gained for patients with a 10-year absolute risk of cardiovascular disease greater than 25%, and 1039-1221 dollars/QALY gained for those with an absolute risk greater than 5%.

3428,"Cost-effectiveness of using recombinant human TSH prior to radioiodine ablation for thyroid cancer, compared with treating patients in a hypothyroid state: the German perspective","OBJECTIVE: This investigation evaluated the cost-effectiveness of radioiodine remnant ablation following preparation with recombinant human TSH (rhTSH), compared with the standard preparation, whereby patients are rendered hypothyroid. DESIGN: The economic evaluation relates to patients with well differentiated thyroid cancer who have undergone thyroidectomy, but have no metastases. The evaluation takes a societal perspective, considering costs and benefits to all parties. The benefits were expressed in units of quality-adjusted life years (QALY), so differences in life expectancy were captured with consideration of quality of life. METHODS: A lifetime Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation of 100,000 patients was used to assess cost per QALY gained. The clinical inputs were sourced from a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial comparing remnant ablation success after rhTSH-preparation with hypothyroid preparation. The model applied German unit costs, however, the structure is generalisable to other jurisdictions. The additional cost of rhTSH procurement and administration is considered relative to the clinical benefits and cost offsets. These included avoidance of hypothyroidism, increased work productivity, earlier discharge from radioprotection and a theoretical reduction in the risk of secondary malignancy. The latter two benefits relate to faster radioiodine clearance after rhTSH preparation. RESULTS: The additional benefits of rhTSH (0.0495 QALY) are obtained with an incremental societal cost of 47 euro, equating to an incremental cost per QALYof 958 euro. Sensitivity analyses had only a modest impact upon cost-effectiveness, with all one-way sensitivity results remaining under 15,000 euro/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The use of rhTSH prior to radioiodine ablation represents good value-for-money with the benefits to patient and society obtained at modest net cost.",2006-01-02487,16914594,Eur J Endocrinol,P Mernagh,2006,155 / 3,405-14,No,16914594,"P Mernagh; S Campbell; M Dietlein; M Luster; E Mazzaferri; A R Weston; Cost-effectiveness of using recombinant human TSH prior to radioiodine ablation for thyroid cancer, compared with treating patients in a hypothyroid state: the German perspective, Eur J Endocrinol, 2006-Sep; 155(3):0804-4643; 405-14",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Radioiodine remnant ablation following preparation with recombinant human TSH,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,958,Euro,2004,1632.57

OBJECTIVE: To compare cost-effectiveness results obtained from a RCT setting with the results derived from community-based clinical practice. METHODS: Using data from a community-based cohort study and from a RCT, two cost-effectiveness analyses were performed and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for the use of etanercept in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. RESULTS: Using an effectiveness-based analysis, the mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained during the 12-month monitoring period were 0.45 and 0.35 for the treatment and control groups respectively. The ICER for etanercept treatment was 174,200 dollars (CDN) per QALY (95% confidence limits between 119,500 dollars and 285,000 dollars). Incorporating efficacy data obtained from the RCT into the analysis, the mean QALYs gained were 0.56 and 0.35 for the treatment and control groups respectively. This resulted in a substantially lower ICER for etanercept treatment of 82,952 dollars per QALY (95% confidence limits between 66,500 dollars and 103,430 dollars).

3431,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of fluticasone propionate for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the presence of missing data,"OBJECTIVES: To explore the cost-effectiveness of fluticasone propionate (FP) for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we estimated costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 3 years, based on an economic appraisal of a previously reported clinical trial (Inhaled Steroids in Obstructive Lung Disease in Europe [ISOLDE]). METHODS: Seven hundred forty-two patients enrolled in the ISOLDE trial who received either FP or placebo had data available on health-care costs and quality of life over the period of the study. The SF-36-based utility scores for quality of life were used to calculate QALYs. A combined imputation and bootstrapping procedure was employed to handle missing data and to estimate statistical uncertainty in the estimated cumulative costs and QALYs over the study period. The imputation approach was based on propensity scoring and nesting this approach within the bootstrap ensured that multiple imputations were performed such that statistical estimates included imputation uncertainty. RESULTS: Complete data were available on mortality within the follow-up period of the study and a nonsignificant trend toward improved survival of 0.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]-0.01 to 0.15) life-years was observed. In an analysis based on a propensity scoring approach to missing data we estimated the incremental costs of FP versus placebo to be 1021 sterling pound(95% CI 619-1338 sterling pound) with an additional effect of 0.11 QALYs (CI 0.04-0.20). Cost-effectiveness estimates for the within-trial period of 17,700 sterling pound per life-year gained (6900 sterling pound to infinity) and 9500 sterling pound per QALY gained (CI 4300-26,500 sterling pound) were generated that include uncertainty due to the imputation process. An alternative imputation approach did not materially affect these estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Previous analyses of the ISOLDE study showed significant improvement on disease-specific health status measures and a trend toward a survival advantage for treatment with FP. This analysis shows that joint considerations of quality of life and survival result in a substantial increase in QALYs favoring treatment with FP. Based on these data, the inhaled corticosteroid FP appears cost-effective for the treatment of COPD. Confirmation or refutation of this result may be achieved once the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study reports, a large randomized controlled trial powered to detect mortality changes associated with the use of FP alone, or in combination with salmeterol, which is also collecting resource use and utility data suitable for estimating cost-effectiveness.",2006-01-02498,16903992,Value Health,Andrew H Briggs,2006,9 / 4,227-35,Yes,16903992,"Andrew H Briggs; Greta Lozano-Ortega; Sally Spencer; Geraldine Bale; Michael D Spencer; P Sherwood Burge; Estimating the cost-effectiveness of fluticasone propionate for treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the presence of missing data, Value Health, 2006 Jul-Aug; 9(4):1098-3015; 227-35",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with inhaled fluticasone propionate (FP),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.50,3.50,9500,United Kingdom,1999,23866.85
3432,Cost effectiveness of adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin therapy in patients not at cholesterol treatment goal in Canada,"INTRODUCTION: This analysis compared the cost effectiveness of adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin therapy versus atorvastatin titration or adding cholestyramine (a resin) for patients at high risk of a coronary artery disease (CAD) event who did not reach target cholesterol levels on their current atorvastatin dosage. The primary analysis focused on 65-year-old patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels of 3.1 or 3.6 mmol/L with a treatment goal of <2.5 mmol/L, classified as very high risk according to the 2000 Canadian Guidelines for Management and Treatment of Hyperlipidaemia. METHODS: A previously developed Markov model was utilised to capture the cost and clinical consequences of lipid-lowering therapy in primary and secondary prevention of CAD. Comparisons between treatment strategies were made using ICERs (cost per QALY) from a Canadian Ministry of Health perspective. The effects of lipid-lowering therapies were based on clinical trial data. The risks of CAD events were estimated using Framingham Heart Study risk equations. Treatment costs and the costs of acute and long-term care for CAD events were included in the analysis. Costs (Canadian dollar, 2002 values) and outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum. RESULTS: Ezetimibe added to atorvastatin therapy compared with treatment with the most common fixed atorvastatin daily dosage (10 mg) or with common atorvastatin titration strategies (up to 20 mg daily; up to 40 mg daily) resulted in cost per QALY estimates ranging from 25,344 to 44,332 Canadian dollars. The addition of ezetimibe to atorvastatin therapy was less costly and more effective than the addition of cholestyramine (dominant). CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin for patients not achieving treatment goals with their current atorvastatin dose produces greater clinical benefits than treatment with a fixed-dose atorvastatin or atorvastatin titration at an increased overall cost.

3435,"Pharmacoeconomic analyses of azathioprine, methotrexate and prospective pharmacogenetic testing for the management of inflammatory bowel disease","OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost effectiveness of azathioprine (AZA), methotrexate (MTX) and no immunosuppression for maintaining remission of moderate to severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in New Zealand Caucasians, and to determine whether prospective testing for poor metabolisers of AZA by genotype or phenotype is cost effective. METHODS: Pharmacoeconomic models were developed to compare treatment costs and effects (QALYs) in theoretical populations of 1,000 IBD patients over a 1-year period. Efficacy and tolerability profiles for AZA and MTX were taken from the literature. The costs (year 2004 values) of the drugs and treatment of adverse effects were estimated from New Zealand drug and service costs. Representations of the patients' health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) were obtained from clinicians via the EQ-5D health state classification system and valued using the New Zealand EQ-5D social tariff. The effects of genotyping or phenotyping a population for thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) status were compared using the prevalence of TPMT deficiency in Caucasians, the relative risks of neutropenia and the associated costs. RESULTS: Net cost savings (vs no immunosuppressant treatment) of approximately 2.5 million and 1 million New Zealand dollars were realised for AZA and MTX, respectively, for the theoretical 1,000 patients, and AZA generated 877 QALYs compared with 633 for MTX. Phenotype and genotype testing generated net cost savings (vs no testing) of 120,000 and 11,000 New Zealand dollars, respectively. Savings related to phenotype tests were greater because of the lower assay costs of phenotype testing and a greater likelihood of pre-empting neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that both MTX and AZA may generate significant net cost savings and benefits for patients with IBD in New Zealand, with AZA likely to be more cost effective than MTX. Prospective testing for poor metabolisers of AZA may also be cost effective, with phenotype testing likely to be more cost effective than genotype testing.",2006-01-02503,16898847,Pharmacoeconomics,Virginia L Priest,2006,24 / 8,767-81,Yes,16898847,"Virginia L Priest; Evan J Begg; Sharon J Gardiner; Christopher M A Frampton; Richard B Gearry; Murray L Barclay; David W J Clark; Paul Hansen; Pharmacoeconomic analyses of azathioprine, methotrexate and prospective pharmacogenetic testing for the management of inflammatory bowel disease, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(8):1179-2027; 767-81",QALY,New Zealand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with Azathioprine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2836.28,Australia,2004,-2861.91

RESULTS: Net cost savings (vs no immunosuppressant treatment) of approximately 2.5 million and 1 million New Zealand dollars were realised for AZA and MTX, respectively, for the theoretical 1,000 patients, and AZA generated 877 QALYs compared with 633 for MTX. Phenotype and genotype testing generated net cost savings (vs no testing) of 120,000 and 11,000 New Zealand dollars, respectively. Savings related to phenotype tests were greater because of the lower assay costs of phenotype testing and a greater likelihood of pre-empting neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that both MTX and AZA may generate significant net cost savings and benefits for patients with IBD in New Zealand, with AZA likely to be more cost effective than MTX. Prospective testing for poor metabolisers of AZA may also be cost effective, with phenotype testing likely to be more cost effective than genotype testing.",2006-01-02503,16898847,Pharmacoeconomics,Virginia L Priest,2006,24 / 8,767-81,Yes,16898847,"Virginia L Priest; Evan J Begg; Sharon J Gardiner; Christopher M A Frampton; Richard B Gearry; Murray L Barclay; David W J Clark; Paul Hansen; Pharmacoeconomic analyses of azathioprine, methotrexate and prospective pharmacogenetic testing for the management of inflammatory bowel disease, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(8):1179-2027; 767-81",QALY,New Zealand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with Methotrexate,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1660.37,Australia,2004,-1675.37
3437,A cost-effectiveness analysis of n-3 PUFA (Omacor) treatment in post-MI patients,"This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of Omacor treatment as a standard prevention measure post-MI in the UK. A cost-effectiveness model was developed based on the GISSI-P trial, combining a survival and a Markov model, over a lifetime period. The base case results for Omacor, at 4 years and over a lifetime, respectively, were: cost [corrected] per QALY gained: pound15,189 and 3,723; [corrected] cost per life years gained (LYG): pound12,011 and pound2,812 [corrected] The cost per death avoided at 4 years was pound31,786. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses did not change the base case results substantially. The use of Omacor as a standard post-MI prevention treatment seems warranted in the UK, both on the basis of its efficacy, which is in addition to other prophylactic treatments as evidenced by the results of the GISSI-P trial, and on cost-effectiveness grounds - both at 4 years and over a lifetime's time-horizon, using the current cost-effectiveness thresholds.",2006-01-02508,16893435,Int J Clin Pract,S Quilici,2006,60 / 8,922-32,No,16893435,"S Quilici; M Martin; A McGuire; Y Zoellner; A cost-effectiveness analysis of n-3 PUFA (Omacor) treatment in post-MI patients, Int J Clin Pract, 2006-Aug; 60(8):1368-5031; 922-32",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with OMACOR (900 mg n-3 per capsule) for secondary prevention treatment in post MI patients.,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,3723,United Kingdom,2004,9349.88
3438,Using decision analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiation therapy in the treatment of intermediate risk prostate cancer,"BACKGROUND: The specific aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared with three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in the treatment of a 70-year-old with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. METHODS: A Markov model was designed with the following states; posttreatment, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and death. Transition probabilities from one state to another were calculated from rates derived from the literature for IMRT and 3D-CRT. Utility values for each health state were obtained from preliminary studies of preferences conducted at Fox Chase Cancer Center. The analysis took a payer's perspective. Expected mean costs, cost-effectiveness scatterplots, and cost acceptability curves were calculated with commercially available software. RESULTS: The expected mean cost of patients undergoing IMRT was $47,931 with a survival of 6.27 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The expected mean cost of patients having 3D-CRT was $21,865 with a survival of 5.62 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness comparing IMRT with CRT was $40,101/QALYs. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analysis revealed a 55.1% probability of IMRT being cost-effective at a $50,000/QALY willingness to pay. CONCLUSION: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was found to be cost-effective, however, at the upper limits of acceptability. The results, however, are dependent on the assumptions of improved biochemical disease-free survival with fewer patients undergoing subsequent salvage therapy and improved quality of life after the treatment.

3439,Screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic children with Down syndrome: cost-effectiveness of preventing lymphoma,"BACKGROUND: Studies demonstrate an increased prevalence of celiac disease in persons with Down syndrome, leading some organizations and authors to recommend universal screening of children with Down syndrome. However, many children with Down syndrome are asymptomatic, and the long-term implications of screening are unknown. The complication of celiac disease that leads to mortality in the general population is non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this research in asymptomatic children with Down syndrome was to (1) calculate the number needed to screen to prevent a single case of lymphoma and (2) present a cost-effectiveness study of screening. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree using probabilities derived from the published literature for Down syndrome or from the general population where Down syndrome-specific data were not available. Celiac disease was determined by serologic screening and confirmation with intestinal biopsy. Sensitivity analysis was used to alter probability estimates affecting the cost of preventing lymphoma. RESULTS: Using our baseline values, the no-screen strategy is dominant; that is, screening not only costs more but also results in fewer quality-adjusted life-years. A screening strategy costs more than $500,000 per life-year gained. Screening all asymptomatic children with Down syndrome for celiac disease costs almost $5 million to prevent a single case of lymphoma. CONCLUSION: These analyses do not support the cost-effectiveness of screening, and more data are needed before recommendations to screen asymptomatic children with Down syndrome for celiac disease can be made.",2006-01-02512,16882812,Pediatrics,Nancy L Swigonski,2006,118 / 2,594-602,No,16882812,"Nancy L Swigonski; Heather L Kuhlenschmidt; Marilyn J Bull; Mark R Corkins; Stephen M Downs; Screening for celiac disease in asymptomatic children with Down syndrome: cost-effectiveness of preventing lymphoma, Pediatrics, 2006-Aug; 118(2):1098-4275; 594-602",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for Celiac disease,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-132862,United States,2005,-176068.34
3440,Cost-effectiveness analysis of core decompression,"Core decompression is widely used to treat the early stages of osteonecrosis of the hip. The purpose of this analysis is to assist orthopedic surgeons in judging whether currently available data support the use of core decompression as cost-effective. A decision model was created for the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head. Literature review was used to identify possible outcomes and their probability after initial treatment with either observation or core decompression. This model demonstrates core decompression must delay the need for total hip arthroplasty for a minimum of 5 years to maintain an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio lower than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained. Treatment options with ratios higher than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year are generally considered to have limited cost-effectiveness. This study demonstrates that core decompression has the potential to be a highly cost-effective alternative if it is leads to a delay in the need for total hip arthroplasty of 5 years or longer.",2006-01-02518,16877152,J Arthroplasty,Nelson Fong Soohoo,2006,21 / 5,670-81,No,16877152,"Nelson Fong Soohoo; Shail Vyas; Jesse Manunga; Husham Sharifi; Gerald Kominski; Jay R Lieberman; Cost-effectiveness analysis of core decompression, J Arthroplasty, 2006-Aug; 21(5):0883-5403; 670-81",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Core decompression,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,9551,United States,1998,15165.05
3441,Economic evaluation of tiotropium and salmeterol in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Greece,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of two therapeutic alternatives for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the Greek National Health Service (NHS) setting. METHODS: A Markov probabilistic model was used to compare tiotropium with salmeterol. A Monte Carlo simulation with 5000 cases was run in the probabilistic analysis. The model was designed to compute the expected time spent in each state, the expected number of exacerbations occurring and the expected treatment cost per patient. Probabilities were extracted from clinical trials, resource utilisation and cost data from a Greek university hospital. RESULTS: Quality adjusted life years were 0.70 (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 0.63 to 0.77) in the tiotropium arm and 0.68 (95% UI: 0.60 to 0.75) in the salmeterol arm; a difference of 0.02 (95% UI: -0.08 to 0.13). Exacerbations reached 0.85 (95% UI: 0.80 to 0.91) in the tiotropium arm and 1.02 (95% UI: 0.84 to 1.21) in the salmeterol arm, a difference of -0.17 (95% UI: -0.37 to 0.02). Estimates of the mean annual cost per patient were euro2504 (euro2122 to euro2965) in the tiotropium arm and euro2655 (euro2111 to euro3324) in the salmeterol arm, a difference of -euro151 (-euro926 to euro580). Stochastic analysis showed that tiotropium may have an advantage in reducing exacerbations. The probability that tiotropium is cost-effective was 65% at a ceiling value of euro0 and reached 77% at a ceiling ratio of euro1000. Results stay fairly constant in various sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Even though tiotropium is more expensive to buy than salmeterol in the Greek NHS (using Greek costs there was no statistically significant difference in total costs between tiotropium and salmeterol), overall, during the course of a year, it is actually associated with a lower prevalence of exacerbations and lower treatment costs and thus may represent a viable and cost-effective alternative in the Greek NHS setting.",2006-01-02523,16870084,Curr Med Res Opin,Nikos Maniadakis,2006,22 / 8,1599-607,No,16870084,"Nikos Maniadakis; Nikolaos Tzanakis; Vassilis Fragoulakis; Magdalini Hatzikou; Nikolaos Siafakas; Economic evaluation of tiotropium and salmeterol in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in Greece, Curr Med Res Opin, 2006-Aug; 22(8):0300-7995; 1599-607",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-7550,Euro,2005,-12455.23
3442,Economic evaluation of weight loss interventions in overweight and obese women,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a clinical and economic evaluation of outpatient weight loss strategies in overweight and obese adult U.S. women. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: This study was a lifetime cost-use analysis from a societal perspective, using a first-order Monte Carlo simulation. Strategies included routine primary care and varying combinations of diet, exercise, behavior modification, and/or pharmacotherapy. Primary data were collected to assess program costs and obesity-related quality of life. Other data were obtained from clinical trials, population-based surveys, and other published literature. This was a simulated cohort of healthy 35-year-old overweight and obese women in the United States. RESULTS: For overweight and obese women, a three-component intervention of diet, exercise, and behavior modification cost 12,600 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with routine care. All other strategies were either less effective and more costly or less effective and less cost-effective compared with the next best alternative. Results were most influenced by obesity-related effects on quality of life and the probabilities of weight loss maintenance. DISCUSSION: A multidisciplinary weight loss program consisting of diet, exercise, and behavior modification provides good value for money, but more research is required to confirm the impacts of such programs on quality of life and the likelihood of long-term weight loss maintenance.",2006-01-02526,16861615,Obesity (Silver Spring),Larissa Roux,2006,14 / 6,1093-106,No,16861615,"Larissa Roux; Karen M Kuntz; Cam Donaldson; Sue J Goldie; Economic evaluation of weight loss interventions in overweight and obese women, Obesity (Silver Spring), 2006-Jun; 14(6):1930-7381; 1093-106",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"A three component intervention of diet, exercise, and behavior modification",Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,12600,United States,2001,18413.43
3444,A cost effectiveness analysis within a randomised controlled trial of post-acute care of older people in a community hospital,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of post-acute care for older people in a locality based community hospital compared with a department for care of elderly people in a district general hospital, which admits patients aged over 76 years with acute medical conditions. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis within a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Community hospital and district general hospital in Yorkshire, England. PARTICIPANTS: 220 patients needing rehabilitation after an acute illness for which they required admission to hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Multidisciplinary care in the district general hospital or prompt transfer to the community hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: EuroQol EQ-5D scores transformed into quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and health and social service costs over six months from randomisation. RESULTS: The mean QALY score for the community hospital group was marginally non-significantly higher than that for the district general hospital group (0.38 v 0.35) at six months after recruitment. The mean (standard deviation) costs per patient of the health and social services resources used were similar for both groups: community hospital group 7233 pounds sterling (euros 10,567; 13,341 dollars) (5031 pounds sterling), district general hospital group 7351 pounds sterling(6229 pounds sterling), and these findings were robust to several sensitivity analyses. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for community hospital care dominated. A cost effectiveness acceptability curve, based on bootstrapped simulations, suggests that at a willingness to pay threshold of 10,000 pounds sterling per QALY, 51% of community hospital cases will be cost effective, which rises to 53% of cases when the threshold is 30,000 pounds sterling per QALY.

3446,Modelling the economic and health consequences of cardiac resynchronization therapy in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: Clinical evidence supports the use of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in advanced heart failure, but its cost-effectiveness is still unclear. This analysis assessed the economic and health consequences in the UK of implanting a CRT in patients with NYHA class III-IV heart failure. METHODS: A discrete event simulation of heart failure was used to compare the course over 5 years of 1000 identical pairs of patients -- one receiving both CRT and optimum pharmacologic treatment (OPT), the other OPT alone. All inputs were obtained from the data collected in the CArdiac REsynchronization in Heart Failure (CARE-HF) trial and a hospital in the UK. Direct medical costs (in 2004 pound) from the perspective of the National Health Service were considered. Both costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5%. Sensitivity analyses addressed all model inputs and multivariate analyses were performed by varying key parameters simultaneously. RESULTS: The model predicted 471 deaths and 2263 hospitalizations over 5 years with OPT alone and 348 deaths and 1764 hospitalizations with CRT, equivalent to a 26% reduction in mortality and 22% in hospitalizations, at a discounted cost of pound 11,423 per patient with CRT vs. pound 4,900 with OPT alone. CRT was predicted to increase quality-adjusted survival by 0.43 QALYs per patient, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound 15,247 per QALY gained (range: pound 12,531- pound 23,184). Sensitivity analyses revealed that this outcome was most sensitive to time horizon and cost of implantation.

3447,The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of intravenous versus oral proton pump inhibitors in peptic ulcer hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The most cost-effective route of administering proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy in peptic ulcer hemorrhage remains uncertain. Oral (PO) PPI therapy may be less effective than intravenous (IV) PPI therapy, but is less expensive and does not mandate a 72-hour posthemostasis hospital stay to complete a full therapeutic course. Because there are currently no published head-to-head clinical trials comparing IV vs PO PPIs, we used decision analysis with budget impact modeling to measure the clinical and economic outcomes of these competing modes of administration. METHODS: We compared 3 postendoscopic strategies for high-risk peptic ulcer hemorrhage: (1) PO PPI therapy, (2) IV PPI therapy, and (3) IV histamine(2) receptor antagonist therapy. The primary outcomes were cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and per-member per-month cost in a hypothetical managed care organization with 1,000,000 covered lives. RESULTS: Compared with the PPI strategies, the histamine(2) receptor antagonist strategy was more expensive and less effective. Of the 2 PPI strategies, using IV instead of PO PPI cost an incremental 708,735 US dollars per year to gain 1 additional quality-adjusted life-year. Substituting IV in lieu of PO PPI cost each member 2.86 US dollars per month to subsidize. The IV PPI strategy became dominant when the rebleed rate with PO PPIs exceeded 24% (base case = 13%), and when the hospital stay on IV PPIs decreased to less than 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The higher effectiveness of IV PPI therapy may not offset its increased costs vs PO PPI therapy in ulcer hemorrhage.

3448,Cost effectiveness of paclitaxel-eluting stents for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization: results from the TAXUS-IV Trial,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare aggregate medical care costs for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) and bare-metal stents (BMS) and to formally evaluate the incremental cost effectiveness of PES for patients undergoing single-vessel percutaneous coronary intervention. BACKGROUND: Although the cost effectiveness of SES has been studied in both clinical trials and decision-analytic models, few data exist on the cost effectiveness of alternative drug-eluting stent (DES) designs. In addition, no clinical trials have specifically examined the cost effectiveness of DES among patients managed without mandatory angiographic follow-up. METHODS: We performed a prospective economic evaluation among 1,314 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization randomized to either PES (N = 662) or BMS (N = 652) in the TAXUS-IV trial. Clinical outcomes, resource use, and costs (from a societal perspective) were assessed prospectively for all patients over a 1-year follow-up period. Cost effectiveness was defined as the incremental cost per target vessel revascularization (TVR) event avoided and was analyzed separately among cohorts assigned to mandatory angiographic follow-up (n = 732) or clinical follow-up alone (n = 582). RESULTS: The PES reduced TVR by 12.2 events per 100 patients treated, resulting in a 1-year cost difference of 572 dollars per patient with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 4,678 dollars per TVR avoided and 47,798 dollars/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Among patients assigned to clinical follow-up alone, the net 1-year cost difference was 97 dollars per patient with cost-effectiveness ratios of 760 dollars per TVR event avoided and $5,105/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: In the TAXUS-IV trial, treatment with PES led to substantial reductions in the need for repeat revascularization while increasing 1-year costs only modestly. The cost-effectiveness ratio for PES in the study population compares reasonably with that for other treatments that reduce coronary restenosis, including alternative drug-eluting stent platforms.",2006-01-02541,16843171,J Am Coll Cardiol,Ameet Bakhai,2006,48 / 2,253-61,No,16843171,"Ameet Bakhai; Gregg W Stone; Elizabeth Mahoney; Tara A Lavelle; Chunxue Shi; Ronna H Berezin; Betsy J Lahue; Mary Ann Clark; Michael J Lacey; Mary E Russell; Stephen G Ellis; James B Hermiller; David A Cox; David J Cohen; Cost effectiveness of paclitaxel-eluting stents for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization: results from the TAXUS-IV Trial, J Am Coll Cardiol, 2006-Jul-18; 48(2):0735-1097; 253-61",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,47798,United States,2004,65487.81
3449,Cost-effectiveness of acupuncture treatment in patients with chronic neck pain,"Acupuncture is increasingly used in patients with chronic pain, but there is a lack of evidence on the cost-benefit relationship of this treatment strategy. The objective of this study was to assess costs and cost-effectiveness of additional acupuncture treatment in patients with chronic neck pain compared to patients receiving routine care alone. A randomized controlled trial including patients (18 years of age) with chronic neck pain (>6 months) was carried out. We assessed the resource use and health related quality of life (SF-36) at baseline and after 3 months using complete social health insurance funds and standardized questionnaires, respectively. The main outcome parameters were direct and indirect cost differences during the 3 months study period and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of acupuncture treatment. A total of 3,451 patients (1,753 acupuncture-group, 1,698 control-group) were randomized (31% men, age 53.5+/-12.9 years; 69% women, 49.2+/-12.7 years). Acupuncture treatment was associated with significantly higher costs over the 3 months study duration compared to routine care (925.53+/-1,551.06 euros vs. 648.06+/-1,459.13 euros; mean difference: 277.47 euros [95% CI: 175.71 euros-379.23 euros]). This cost increase was mainly due to costs of acupuncture (361.76+/-90.16 euros). The ICER was 12,469 euros per QALY gained and proved robust in additional sensitivity analyses. Since health insurance databases were used, private medical expenses such as over the counter medication were not included. Beyond the 3 months study duration, acupuncture might be associated with further health economic effects.

3450,Cost-effectiveness of sirolimus therapy with early cyclosporin withdrawal vs. long-term cyclosporin therapy in Australia,"Cyclosporin (CsA) is Australia's most widely used immunosuppressant following renal transplantation. Randomized clinical trials demonstrate that sirolimus use for immunosuppression is associated with significantly lower incidence rates of nephrotoxicity and chronic graft rejection, and lower serum creatinine levels, suggesting long-term benefits if used as a replacement therapy for CsA. The cost-effectiveness of replacing CsA with sirolimus after 2-4 months (as approved by Australian regulatory authorities) was assessed relative to continued CsA plus low-dose sirolimus. A Markov model simulated outcomes over a patient's lifetime from initial transplant. Costs, measured in Australian dollars from the perspective of the Australian healthcare system, included immunosuppressants, dialysis, and inpatient and outpatient treatment. In a cohort with a mean age of 45 yr, the mean lifetime cost per patient is $39,052 greater with the study therapy. However, an average of 272 chronic graft rejections and 91 regrafts are prevented per 1000 patients. The mean predicted survival benefit is 2.086 life-years, or 0.938 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) when utility weights and discounting are incorporated. The incremental cost per QALY gained with the study therapy was $41,613. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to model duration and dialysis cost.

The cost-effectiveness of treating CHC in the setting of PNALT has not been assessed. Disease progression in patients with PNALT was simulated in a Markov model. The rate of fibrosis progression, quality of life and costs for each health state were based on literature estimates. The perspective of the Italian National Health Service was adopted and costs (euro 2003) and benefits were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses were performed on important parameters. The primary analysis compared combination therapy with peginterferon alpha-2a (40 kDa) plus ribavirin to no treatment in a cohort of patients with mean age 45 years, and was based on findings from a multinational, randomized trial in patients with PNALT. In genotype 1 patients, the risk of cirrhosis at 30 years is forecast to fall from 32% with no treatment to 19% with combination therapy, increasing quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.74 years at an incremental cost per QALY gained of euro 16,831. The 30-year risk of cirrhosis in genotype 2 or 3 is projected to fall to 9% with combination therapy, an increase in QALYs of 1.34 years, at an incremental cost per QALY gained of euro 3,000.

3453,Acarbose in addition to existing treatments in patients with type 2 diabetes: health economic analysis in a German setting,"OBJECTIVE: A recent retrospective meta-analysis of cardiovascular events from long-term studies with acarbose in type 2 diabetes showed that treatment was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular events, supporting the hypothesis that postprandial hyperglycemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of acarbose, given in addition to existing treatments, in type 2 diabetes patients, based on these findings, in the German setting. METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model, a published, validated computer simulation model, was used to project long-term clinical and cost outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients receiving acarbose or placebo in addition to existing treatments. Direct costs were retrieved from published sources and projected over patient lifetimes from a third party payer perspective. Costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 5% annually. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Acarbose treatment was associated with improvements in discounted life expectancy (0.21 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) (0.19 QALYs) but was on average marginally more expensive than treatment in the placebo arm (euro135 per patient). This led to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of euro633 per life year and euro692 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that these findings were robust under variation in a range of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of acarbose to existing treatment was associated with improvements in life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy, and provides excellent value for money over patient lifetimes in the German setting.",2006-01-02549,16834840,Curr Med Res Opin,Stéphane Roze,2006,22 / 7,1415-24,No,16834840,"Stéphane Roze; William J Valentine; Thomas Evers; Andrew J Palmer; Acarbose in addition to existing treatments in patients with type 2 diabetes: health economic analysis in a German setting, Curr Med Res Opin, 2006-Jul; 22(7):0300-7995; 1415-24",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Acarbose,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,5.00,5.00,692,Euro,2004,1179.27
3454,Cost-effectiveness of extended adjuvant letrozole therapy after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of extended adjuvant letrozole in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer and estrogen or progesterone receptor-positive tumors who had completed 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we estimated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with extended adjuvant letrozole vs no extended adjuvant therapy. Probabilities of breast cancer recurrence or new contralateral tumor adverse effects and death were estimated using data from the MA.17 study and other secondary sources. Costs (in 2004 US dollars) and quality-of-life effects (utilities) of breast cancer events and adverse effects were derived from the literature. RESULTS: In base-case analyses, extended adjuvant letrozole vs no extended adjuvant therapy results in an expected gain of 0.34 QALYs per patient (13.62 vs 13.28 QALYs), at an additional lifetime cost of 9699 dollars per patient (55,254 dollars vs 45,555 dollars). The incremental cost per QALY gained with letrozole is 28,728 dollars. Cost-effectiveness is sensitive to the assumed reduction in risk of breast cancer events with letrozole but is insensitive to the risks, costs, and quality-of-life effects of osteoporosis and hip fracture. Cost-effectiveness is less than 100,000 dollars per QALY for node-positive patients younger than 81 years and for node-negative patients younger than 73 years. CONCLUSION: For postmenopausal women with early breast cancer who have completed 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, the cost-effectiveness of extended adjuvant letrozole is within the range of other generally accepted medical interventions in the United States.",2006-01-02552,16834524,Am J Manag Care,Thomas E Delea,2006,12 / 7,374-86,No,16834524,"Thomas E Delea; Jonathan Karnon; Robert E Smith; Stephen R D Johnston; Jane Brandman; Jennifer C Y Sung; Paul E Gross; Cost-effectiveness of extended adjuvant letrozole therapy after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer, Am J Manag Care, 2006-Jul; 12(7):1088-0224; 374-86",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Extended adjuvant Letrozole,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,28728,United States,2004,39360.1
3456,Cost-effectiveness of a microvolt T-wave alternans screening strategy for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement in the MADIT-II-eligible population,"OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to compare the cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement with and without risk stratification with microvolt T-wave alternans (MTWA) testing in the MADIT-II (Second Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial) eligible population. BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators have been shown to prevent mortality in the MADIT-II population. Microvolt T-wave alternans testing has been shown to be effective in risk stratifying MADIT-II-eligible patients. METHODS: On the basis of published data, cost-effectiveness of three therapeutic strategies in MADIT-II-eligible patients was assessed using a Markov model: 1) ICD placement in all; 2) ICD placement in patients testing MTWA non-negative;, and 3) medical management. Outcomes of expected cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness were determined for patient lifetime. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, providing ICDs only to those who test MTWA non-negative produced a gain of 1.14 QALYs at an incremental cost of 55,700 dollars when compared to medical therapy, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 48,700 dollars/QALY. When compared with a MTWA risk-stratification strategy, placing ICDs in all patients resulted in an ICER of 88,700 dollars/QALY. Most (83%) of the potential benefit was achieved by implanting ICDs in the 67% of patients who tested MTWA non-negative. Results were most sensitive to the effectiveness of MTWA as a risk-stratification tool, MTWA negative screen rate, cost and efficacy of ICD therapy, and patient risk for arrhythmic death. CONCLUSIONS: Risk stratification with MTWA testing in MADIT-II-eligible patients improves the cost-effectiveness of ICDs.

3458,Clinical and economic impact of epoetin in adjuvant-chemotherapy for breast cancer,"INTRODUCTION: Anaemia is a common toxicity in cancer patients and epoetins (EPOs) are now an established treatment. The economic profile of EPO treatment was assessed in patients with breast cancer treated by adjuvant-chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two strategies were compared: without treatment by EPO and with the possible use of treatment by EPO (epoetin alfa) when required. The clinical effectiveness criterion was time adjusted to quality of life and economic data included only direct medical costs. MAIN RESULTS: One hundred ninety-two patients were included. In the group with the strategy containing the possible use of EPO, 45.5% of patients effectively received EPO. A significant difference in the haemoglobin level profile over time was observed which provided a significant overall benefit of 0.0052 (p<10(-4)) quality-adjusted life year (QALY) associated with an extra cost of <euro>1,615 (p<10(-4)). In the base case analysis, the cost per added QALY was estimated as <euro>310,577 with the strategy containing the possible use of EPO. CONCLUSION: This robust result seems to be unacceptable, but the only relevant point of discussion might be the level of acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a patient.",2006-01-02565,16802128,Support Care Cancer,Philippe Fagnoni,2006,14 / 10,1030-7,No,16802128,"Philippe Fagnoni; Samuel Limat; Loïc Chaigneau; Emmanuel Guardiola; Stéphanie Briaud; Bernard Schmitt; Yacine Merrouche; Xavier Pivot; Marie-Christine Woronoff-Lemsi; Clinical and economic impact of epoetin in adjuvant-chemotherapy for breast cancer, Support Care Cancer, 2006-Oct; 14(10):0941-4355; 1030-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Epoetin alpha,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,22 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,310577,Euro,2004,529268.94
3459,Lifetime health consequences and cost-effectiveness of rosiglitazone in combination with metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the lifetime diabetes health consequences and cost-effectiveness in Spain of rosiglitazone in combination with metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in overweight and obese patients failing to maintain glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy compared with conventional care of metformin in combination with either sulfonylureas or bedtime insulin. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Diabetes Decision Analysis of Cost--Type 2 was adapted for clinical practice and healthcare funding in Spain, and was calibrated with Spanish epidemiological, healthcare resource use and cost data, taking the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. The model simulates lifetime treatment histories, complications and consequences of type 2 diabetes, and associated health outcomes and costs for age and sex-matched cohorts of 1000 overweight and obese patients. The primary health outcome measures compared are glycaemic control, time to insulin, incidence and prevalence of coronary heart disease, stroke, clinical nephropathy, ulceration and amputation, and severe visual loss, and incremental life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Rosiglitazone in combination with metformin produces better glycaemic control than conventional care of metformin in combination with either sulfonylureas or bedtime insulin in most patients, and extends the viability of combination therapy by between 6 and 13 years before requiring insulin. Rosiglitazone patients have a longer life expectancy, gaining between 106 and 175 additional life-years per 1000 patients, experience fewer episodes of coronary disease and clinical nephropathy, and live for longer periods free of complications. The improvements in morbidity and mortality are projected to yield between 134 and 238 additional QALY per 1000 patients over their lifetime. Discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios range from euro 9406 to euro 23,514 per QALY gained.

3463,Cost-effectiveness of rosiglitazone oral combination for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Germany,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of rosiglitazone in combination with other oral agents for the treatment of overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes in Germany. METHODS: The Diabetes Decision Analysis of Cost--type 2 model was adapted for clinical practice and healthcare financing rules in Germany. The model was calibrated using Cost of Diabetes in Europe Type 2 study data and national statistics. The perspective is that of the sickness funds, and includes all hospital inpatient, ambulatory, rehabilitation, and diabetes therapy, other medications, and sickness leave. The model simulates lifetime treatment histories and associated health outcomes and costs for age and sex-matched cohorts of 1000 overweight and obese patients. The measures of effectiveness used in the analysis were life-years and quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The combination therapy of rosiglitazone with metformin or sulfonylurea produces better glycaemic control than conventional care of metformin with sulfonylurea and insulin in most patients, extends the viability of oral therapy before requiring insulin, and typically leads to lifetime cost increases across all treatment types. The improvements in glycaemic control lead to survival gains and reductions in morbidity, because of the reduced risk of developing or progressing to later stages of complications.

METHODS: The Diabetes Decision Analysis of Cost--type 2 model was adapted for clinical practice and healthcare financing rules in Germany. The model was calibrated using Cost of Diabetes in Europe Type 2 study data and national statistics.

3467,Cost-effectiveness of rosiglitazone combination therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: Recent clinical trial results have demonstrated that, in patients with type 2 diabetes, second-line treatment of rosiglitazone in combination with metformin can lead to significant improvements in the control of fasting plasma glucose/ glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after the failure of metformin monotherapy. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the use of rosiglitazone in combination with metformin in overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK, failing to maintain glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy compared with conventional care using metformin in combination with sulfonylurea. METHODS: The Diabetes Decision Analysis of Cost--type 2 (DiDACT) model, an established long-term economic model of type 2 diabetes, which projects the relationship between treatment and HbA1c over extended periods, was used to determine the health outcomes and economic impact for matched age and sex cohorts of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes. The perspective was that of the UK National Health Service and all costs were in UK pounds sterling. RESULTS: Treatment with rosiglitazone in combination with metformin provides better glycaemic control over the remaining lifetime of patients than metformin and sulfonylurea combination therapy. Patients treated with rosiglitazone combination therapy were predicted to have a longer life expectancy, gaining 123 and 140 additional life years per 1000 patients in the obese and overweight cohorts, respectively. Improvements in morbidity and a delay in the start of insulin therapy resulted in a projected improvement in quality of life. These effects combine with projected improved survival to yield 131 and 209 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per 1000 patients in the obese and overweight cohorts, respectively.

The need for more intensified action to identify those infected with the virus has been recognized. Primary care is an important setting for case finding. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost utility of case finding for hepatitis C in primary care, specifically amongst former injecting drug users (IDUs). METHODS: A Markov model was developed to investigate the impact of case finding and treatment on progression of hepatitis C (HCV) in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 former IDUs. Comparison was made with a similar cohort in which no systematic case finding was implemented but spontaneous presentation for testing was allowed. Two scenarios were explored. The testing protocol utilized ELISA and PCR tests. Those eligible for treatment received combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Parameter estimates were obtained from literature searches and experts in the field. RESULTS: Few estimates of the uptake of HCV testing in primary care are available. Cost utility was estimated at around 16,000 pounds sterling/QALY for both scenarios. At a willingness to pay of 30,000 pounds sterling/QALY, there is approximately a 75% probability that the initiatives would be cost-effective. Choices regarding the utility data, discounting and the rates of spontaneous/re-presentation outside of a case-finding programme appear to be important areas of uncertainty in this model.

3471,Pragmatic randomized trial evaluating the clinical and economic effectiveness of acupuncture for chronic low back pain,"In a randomized controlled trial plus a nonrandomized cohort, the authors investigated the effectiveness and costs of acupuncture in addition to routine care in the treatment of chronic low back pain and assessed whether the effects of acupuncture differed in randomized and nonrandomized patients. In 2001, German patients with chronic low back pain were allocated to an acupuncture group or a no-acupuncture control group. Persons who did not consent to randomization were included in a nonrandomized acupuncture group. All patients were allowed to receive routine medical care in addition to study treatment. Back function (Hannover Functional Ability Questionnaire), pain, and quality of life were assessed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months, and cost-effectiveness was analyzed. Of 11,630 patients (mean age=52.9 years (standard deviation, 13.7); 59% female), 1,549 were randomized to the acupuncture group and 1,544 to the control group; 8,537 were included in the nonrandomized acupuncture group. At 3 months, back function improved by 12.1 (standard error (SE), 0.4) to 74.5 (SE, 0.4) points in the acupuncture group and by 2.7 (SE, 0.4) to 65.1 (SE, 0.4) points among controls (difference=9.4 points (95% confidence interval 8.3, 10.5); p<0.001). Nonrandomized patients had more severe symptoms at baseline and showed improvements in back function similar to those seen in randomized patients.

3475,Cost-effectiveness of treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,"BACKGROUND: Despite the existence of effective drug treatments, tuberculosis (TB) causes 2 million deaths annually worldwide. Effective treatment is complicated by multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) strains that respond only to second-line drugs. We projected the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of using drug susceptibility testing and second-line drugs in a lower-middle-income setting with high levels of MDR TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic state-transition model of TB. In a base case analysis, the model was calibrated to approximate the TB epidemic in Peru, a setting with a smear-positive TB incidence of 120 per 100,000 and 4.5% MDR TB among prevalent cases. Secondary analyses considered other settings. The following strategies were evaluated: first-line drugs administered under directly observed therapy (DOTS), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases (STR1), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases with test-confirmed MDR TB (STR2), comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for previously treated cases (ITR1), and comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for all cases (ITR2). Outcomes were costs per TB death averted and costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. We found that strategies incorporating the use of second-line drug regimens following first-line treatment failure were highly cost-effective compared to strategies using first-line drugs only. In our base case, standardized second-line treatment for confirmed MDR TB cases (STR2) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 720 dollars per QALY (8,700 dollars per averted death) compared to DOTS. Individualized second-line drug treatment for MDR TB following first-line failure (ITR1) provided more benefit at an incremental cost of 990 dollars per QALY (12,000 dollars per averted death) compared to STR2. A more aggressive version of the individualized treatment strategy (ITR2), in which both new and previously treated cases are tested for MDR TB, had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 11,000 dollars per QALY (160,000 dollars per averted death) compared to ITR1. The STR2 and ITR1 strategies remained cost-effective under a wide range of alternative assumptions about treatment costs, effectiveness, MDR TB prevalence, and transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of MDR TB using second-line drugs is highly cost-effective in Peru. In other settings, the attractiveness of strategies using second-line drugs will depend on TB incidence, MDR burden, and the available budget, but simulation results suggest that individualized regimens would be cost-effective in a wide range of situations.",2006-01-02575,16796403,PLoS Med,Stephen C Resch,2006,3 / 7,e241,No,16796403,"Stephen C Resch; Joshua A Salomon; Megan Murray; Milton C Weinstein; Cost-effectiveness of treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, PLoS Med, 2006-Jul; 3(7):1549-1676; e241",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,1463.9,United States,2004,2005.68

In our base case, standardized second-line treatment for confirmed MDR TB cases (STR2) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 720 dollars per QALY (8,700 dollars per averted death) compared to DOTS. Individualized second-line drug treatment for MDR TB following first-line failure (ITR1) provided more benefit at an incremental cost of 990 dollars per QALY (12,000 dollars per averted death) compared to STR2. A more aggressive version of the individualized treatment strategy (ITR2), in which both new and previously treated cases are tested for MDR TB, had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 11,000 dollars per QALY (160,000 dollars per averted death) compared to ITR1. The STR2 and ITR1 strategies remained cost-effective under a wide range of alternative assumptions about treatment costs, effectiveness, MDR TB prevalence, and transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of MDR TB using second-line drugs is highly cost-effective in Peru.

3477,Cost-effectiveness of treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis,"BACKGROUND: Despite the existence of effective drug treatments, tuberculosis (TB) causes 2 million deaths annually worldwide. Effective treatment is complicated by multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) strains that respond only to second-line drugs. We projected the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of using drug susceptibility testing and second-line drugs in a lower-middle-income setting with high levels of MDR TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic state-transition model of TB. In a base case analysis, the model was calibrated to approximate the TB epidemic in Peru, a setting with a smear-positive TB incidence of 120 per 100,000 and 4.5% MDR TB among prevalent cases. Secondary analyses considered other settings. The following strategies were evaluated: first-line drugs administered under directly observed therapy (DOTS), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases (STR1), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases with test-confirmed MDR TB (STR2), comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for previously treated cases (ITR1), and comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for all cases (ITR2).

3479,The cost-effectiveness of lamotrigine in the maintenance treatment of adults with bipolar I disorder,"OBJECTIVE: To present an economic model and cost-effectiveness estimates for lamotrigine in maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (BD-I) using outcomes from the pivotal lamotrigine trials. The main comparator treatments in the pivotal trials were lithium and .no maintenance. (acute-only) treatment. A comparison with olanzapine was included as an indirect analysis following publication of data during the course of our research. METHODS: A Markov model was built around the 3 health states of euthymia, mania, and depression. The base-case model simulates a cohort of 1,000 patients with BD-I who have recently stabilized after resolution of a bipolar mania episode. The cohort was modeled for a period of 18 months. Resource-use estimates were derived from best available published data, treatment guidelines, a physician survey, and published unit cost data. Outputs were measured in terms of costs per acute mood episode avoided, costs per euthymic day gained, and costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Direct health care payer costs are used in the analyses. RESULTS: The base-case model for patients with a recent manic episode indicated that lamotrigine is the most effective treatment for avoiding both acute depression episodes and all types of acute episodes (depression and mania). It is also the most effective treatment in terms of number of euthymic days achieved (309 days per patient per year). Olanzapine is most effective for avoiding acute mania episodes. Total direct costs of treatment are lowest for the lithium treatment arm (Dollars 8,710 per patient for the 18-month period). All maintenance therapies were cost effective compared with the no-maintenance (acute-only treatment) arm. In the base case, lamotrigine had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Dollars 30 per euthymic day and Dollars 2,400 per acute episode avoided compared with lithium. A QALY analysis indicated that lamotrigine is cost effective in patients with a recent manic episode at Dollars 26,000 per QALY. The base-case model indicated that lamotrigine dominates olanzapine, (that is, lamotrigine costs less and is more effective than olanzapine) in patients with a recent manic episode. In a sensitivity analysis using outcomes from the pivotal trial of recently depressed patients, lamotrigine, in comparison with lithium, was not shown to be as cost effective as in the recently manic patients, but it was still cost effective compared with no maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: For a defined cohort of patients with BD-I, the pharmacoeconomic model indicated that prevention of mood episodes with lithium and lamotrigine is cost effective in patients with a recent manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode. The conclusions with respect to the indirect comparison with olanzapine should be validated if and when direct trial data become available.

3482,Informing the efficient use of health care and health care research resources - the case of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: An analytical framework using Bayesian decision theory and value-of-information analysis has recently been advocated for the economic evaluation of health technologies. The purpose of this study was to apply this framework to screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in Sweden and to compare the conclusions from this study with the conclusions presented in an assessment performed by the Swedish Council of Technology Assessment (SBU). METHODS: A probabilistic decision-analytical model was developed to establish the cost-effectiveness of a screening programme for AAA relative to current clinical practice and to calculate the value-of-information. RESULTS: The cost per quality-adjusted life-year for screening was 9700 euro. The expected value of perfect information for the assessment of overall cost-effectiveness was low, suggesting little benefit in conducting further research. Expected value of perfect partial information indicated that rupture probabilities were associated with the highest uncertainty. By contrast, the SBU report concluded there was limited evidence of cost-effectiveness and proposed further research. CONCLUSION: The investigated screening programme for AAA is likely to be cost-effective and conducting another clinical trial is unlikely to add much valuable information to this decision problem. These recommendations contrast with the vaguer recommendations from SBU that more evidence is required of costs-effectiveness.",2006-01-02580,16786498,Health Econ,Martin Henriksson,2006,15 / 12,1311-22,No,16786498,"Martin Henriksson; Fredrik Lundgren; Per Carlsson; Informing the efficient use of health care and health care research resources - the case of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in Sweden, Health Econ, 2006-Dec; 15(12):1879-1646; 1311-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm via ultrasound,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1616.67,Euro,2003,2574.27
3483,Cost-effectiveness of self-managed versus physician-managed oral anticoagulation therapy,"BACKGROUND: Patient self-management of long-term oral anticoagulation therapy is an effective strategy in a number of clinical situations, but it is currently not a funded option in the Canadian health care system. We sought to compare the incremental cost and health benefits of self-management with those of physician management from the perspective of the Canadian health care payer over a 5-year period. METHODS: We developed a Bayesian Markov model comparing the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued to patients receiving oral anticoagulation therapy through self-management or physician management for atrial fibrillation or for a mechanical heart valve. Five health states were defined: no events, minor hemorrhagic events, major hemorrhagic events, thrombotic events and death. Data from published literature were used for transition probabilities. Canadian 2003 costs were used, and utility estimates were obtained from various published sources. RESULTS: Self-management resulted in 3.50 fewer thrombotic events, 0.78 fewer major hemorrhagic events and 0.12 fewer deaths per 100 patients than physician management. The average discounted incremental cost of self-management over physician management was found to be 989 dollars (95% confidence interval [CI] 310 dollars-1655 dollars) per patient and the incremental QALYs gained was 0.07 (95% CI 0.06-0.08). The cost-effectiveness of self-management was 14,129 dollars per QALY gained. There was a 95% chance that self-management would be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of 23,800 dollars per QALY. Results were robust in probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses.

3484,Cost-effectiveness of vertebral fracture assessment to detect prevalent vertebral deformity and select postmenopausal women with a femoral neck T-score>-2.5 for alendronate therapy: a modeling study,"Most fractures occur in postmenopausal women who do not have osteoporosis by bone density criteria (T-score>-2.5). Prevalent vertebral deformity is a strong risk factor for incident fractures independent of bone mineral density, yet the majority of these deformities are clinically unapparent. Spine imaging on a dual-energy densitometer, called vertebral fracture assessment (VFA), can accurately detect these deformities. The purpose of this modeling study was to estimate the lifetime societal costs and health benefits of VFA and confirmatory follow-up radiography to detect prevalent vertebral deformity in osteopenic (T-score -1.5, -2.0, or -2.4) postmenopausal women, followed by anti-resorptive drug therapy for those with one or more deformities. We compared three strategies; no initial drug therapy, 5 yr of initial alendronate therapy, or VFA followed by 5 yr of alendronate therapy in those with one or more vertebral deformities confirmed on radiography (VFA strategy). Results for the base-case analyses showed that the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained for the VFA strategy relative to no initial drug therapy ranged from 18,000 US dollars (for a 60-yr-old with a femoral neck T-score of -2.4) to 77,000 US dollars (for an 80-yr-old with a T-score of -1.5).

3486,Cost-effectiveness of tuberculosis evaluation and treatment of newly-arrived immigrants,"BACKGROUND: Immigrants to the U.S. are required to undergo overseas screening for tuberculosis (TB), but the value of evaluation and treatment following entry to the U.S. is not well understood. We determined the cost-effectiveness of domestic follow-up of immigrants identified as tuberculosis suspects through overseas screening. METHODS: Using a stochastic simulation for tuberculosis reactivation, transmission, and follow-up for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness of follow-up and evaluation interventions. We utilized published literature, California Reports of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis (RVCTs), demographic estimates from the California Department of Finance, Medicare reimbursement, and Medi-Cal reimbursement rates. Our target population was legal immigrants to the United States, our time horizon is twenty years, and our perspective was that of all domestic health-care payers. We examined the intervention to offer latent tuberculosis therapy to infected individuals, to increase the yield of domestic evaluation, and to increase the starting and completion rates of LTBI therapy with INH (isoniazid). Our outcome measures were the number of cases averted, the number of deaths averted, the incremental dollar cost (year 2004), and the number of quality-adjusted life-years saved. RESULTS: Domestic follow-up of B-notification patients, including LTBI treatment for latently infected individuals, is highly cost-effective, and at times, cost-saving. B-notification follow-up in California would reduce the number of new tuberculosis cases by about 6-26 per year (out of a total of approximately 3000). Sensitivity analysis revealed that domestic follow-up remains cost-effective when the hepatitis rates due to INH therapy are over fifteen times our best estimates, when at least 0.4 percent of patients have active disease and when hospitalization of cases detected through domestic follow-up is no less likely than hospitalization of passively detected cases.

We determined the cost-effectiveness of domestic follow-up of immigrants identified as tuberculosis suspects through overseas screening. METHODS: Using a stochastic simulation for tuberculosis reactivation, transmission, and follow-up for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness of follow-up and evaluation interventions. We utilized published literature, California Reports of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis (RVCTs), demographic estimates from the California Department of Finance, Medicare reimbursement, and Medi-Cal reimbursement rates. Our target population was legal immigrants to the United States, our time horizon is twenty years, and our perspective was that of all domestic health-care payers. We examined the intervention to offer latent tuberculosis therapy to infected individuals, to increase the yield of domestic evaluation, and to increase the starting and completion rates of LTBI therapy with INH (isoniazid). Our outcome measures were the number of cases averted, the number of deaths averted, the incremental dollar cost (year 2004), and the number of quality-adjusted life-years saved. RESULTS: Domestic follow-up of B-notification patients, including LTBI treatment for latently infected individuals, is highly cost-effective, and at times, cost-saving. B-notification follow-up in California would reduce the number of new tuberculosis cases by about 6-26 per year (out of a total of approximately 3000).

3490,Estimating the cost and health status consequences of treatment with TNF antagonists in patients with psoriatic arthritis,"OBJECTIVES: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to improve the outcomes in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA). We estimate the long-term impact on health status of prescribing the TNF antagonist etanercept, and evaluate the cost-effectiveness in a health economic model. METHODS: The relationship between disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire) and health state utility was explored to estimate the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from the TNF antagonist etanercept. A model was then used to compare sequences of treatments for PsA after failure of two conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). One arm commences on etanercept therapy and this is compared with a strategy commencing with combination therapy of methotrexate and ciclosporin and another commencing with leflunomide. Individual patient data from Phase III etanercept trials is used to populate the model supported by published evidence from extensive literature searches. By incorporating a life table specific for a PsA population, and using a number of evidence- and expert opinion-based assumptions for disease progression, the model was extended beyond the trial duration to a 10-yr time horizon. Cost offsets were produced by avoiding surgery through delayed progression; drug and monitoring costs were also modelled. RESULTS: Over the 10 yrs, modelled etanercept treatment gave 0.82 more QALYs when compared with combination therapy with methotrexate and ciclosporin, and 0.65 more QALYs in comparison with leflunomide. This equates to a central estimate for the cost per QALY of pound28 189 and pound28 189 for ciclosporin and leflunomide, respectively. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated this could vary by as much as +/-28%. CONCLUSIONS: With limited data currently available, the potential cost-effectiveness of etanercept in DMARD failures for adults with PsA appears encouraging. The result for other TNF antagonists will depend on how their relative efficacy and drug price compares with etanercept.

3492,Cost-effectiveness of radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the cost-effectiveness of left atrial catheter ablation (LACA), amiodarone, and rate control therapy in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF). BACKGROUND: Left atrial catheter ablation has been performed to eliminate AF, but its cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LACA in 55- and 65-year-old cohorts with AF at moderate and low stroke risk. Costs, health utilities, and transition probabilities were derived from published literature and Medicare data. We performed primary threshold analyses to determine the minimum level of LACA efficacy and stroke risk reduction needed to make LACA cost-effective at 50,000 dollars and 100,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) thresholds. RESULTS: In 65-year-old subjects with AF at moderate stroke risk, relative reduction in stroke risk with an 80% LACA efficacy rate for sinus rhythm restoration would need to be > or =42% and > or =11% to yield incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) <50,000 dollars and 100,000 dollars per QALY, respectively. Higher and lower LACA efficacy rates would require correspondingly lower and higher stroke risk reduction for equivalent ICER thresholds. In the 55-year-old moderate stroke risk cohort, lower LACA efficacy rates or stroke risk reduction would be needed for the same ICER thresholds. In patients at low stroke risk, LACA was unlikely to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The use of LACA may be cost-effective in patients with AF at moderate risk for stroke, but it is not cost-effective in low-risk patients.

3495,The cost-effectiveness of fluvastatin in Hungary following successful percutaneous coronary intervention,"BACKGROUND: The Lescol Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS) showed substantial gains in health outcomes from statins following PCI. That study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial undertaken in 77 centres, predominantly in Europe, of patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia who had undergone their first PCI. The evidence on cost-effectiveness has been established for the UK, USA and the Netherlands, but due to different health system cost structures, the results may not be applicable to other European countries. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of fluvastatin used following first PCI in Hungary. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A deterministic Markov model was used to estimate the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained, with cost data drawn from the Hungarian National Health Insurance Fund. Effectiveness data on fluvastatin was derived directly from LIPS and utility weights from previous studies on heart disease. Sensitivity analyses were conducted around key parameters and analyses were conducted for subgroups identified in LIPS. RESULTS: Treatment with fluvastatin cost an additional 1,704 euro and resulted in an additional 0.107 QALYs per patient discounted over 10-years compared with controls. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was 15,910 euro. The key determinants of cost-effectiveness were the effectiveness of fluvastatin, utility weights, cost of fluvastatin, and the time horizon evaluated. Fluvastatin was substantially more cost-effective in patients with diabetes, renal disease, multi-vessel disease or LDL-cholesterol >3.4 mmol/l.

3496,Influenza vaccination health impact and cost effectiveness among adults aged 50 to 64 and 65 and older,"BACKGROUND: Influenza causes approximately 36,000 deaths per year in the United States despite the presence of an effective vaccine. This assessment of the value of influenza vaccination to the U.S. population is part of an update to the 2001 ranking of clinical preventive services recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The forthcoming ranking will include the new recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to extend influenza vaccination to adults aged 50 to 64 years. METHODS: This service is evaluated on the two most important dimensions: burden of disease prevented and cost effectiveness. Study methods, described in a companion article, are designed to ensure consistency across many services. RESULTS: Over the lifetime of a birth cohort of 4 million, it is estimated that about 275,000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) would be saved if influenza vaccination were offered annually to all people after age 50. Eighty percent of the QALYs saved (220,000) would be achieved by offering the vaccine only to persons aged 65 and older. In year 2000 dollars, the cost effectiveness of influenza vaccination is $980 per QALY saved in persons aged 65 and older, and $28,000 per QALY saved in persons aged 50 to 64. When the costs of patient time and travel are excluded, the cost effectiveness ratio of vaccinating 50- to 64-year-olds decreases to $7200 per QALY saved, and vaccinating those aged 65 and older saves $17 per person vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination is a high-impact, cost-effective service for persons aged 65 and older.

3497,Repeated tobacco-use screening and intervention in clinical practice: health impact and cost effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: This report updates 2001 estimates of disease burden prevented and cost effectiveness of tobacco-use screening and brief intervention relative to that of other clinical preventive services. It also addresses repeated counseling because the literature has focused on single episodes of treatment, while in reality that is neither desirable nor likely. METHODS: Literature searches led to four models for calculating the clinically preventable burden of deaths and morbidity from smoking as well as the cost effectiveness of providing the service annually over time. The same methods were used in similar calculations for other preventive services to facilitate comparison. RESULTS: Using methods consistent with existing literature for this service, an estimated 190,000 undiscounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are saved at a cost of $1100 per QALY saved (discounted). These estimates exclude financial savings from smoking-attributable disease prevented and use the average 12-month quit rate in clinical practice for tobacco screening and brief cessation counseling with cessation medications (5.0%) and without (2.4%). Including the savings of prevented smoking-attributable disease and using the effectiveness of repeated interventions over the lifetime of smokers (23.1%), 2.47 million QALYs are saved at a cost savings of $500 per smoker who receives the service.

3500,Repeated tobacco-use screening and intervention in clinical practice: health impact and cost effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: This report updates 2001 estimates of disease burden prevented and cost effectiveness of tobacco-use screening and brief intervention relative to that of other clinical preventive services. It also addresses repeated counseling because the literature has focused on single episodes of treatment, while in reality that is neither desirable nor likely. METHODS: Literature searches led to four models for calculating the clinically preventable burden of deaths and morbidity from smoking as well as the cost effectiveness of providing the service annually over time. The same methods were used in similar calculations for other preventive services to facilitate comparison. RESULTS: Using methods consistent with existing literature for this service, an estimated 190,000 undiscounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) are saved at a cost of $1100 per QALY saved (discounted). These estimates exclude financial savings from smoking-attributable disease prevented and use the average 12-month quit rate in clinical practice for tobacco screening and brief cessation counseling with cessation medications (5.0%) and without (2.4%). Including the savings of prevented smoking-attributable disease and using the effectiveness of repeated interventions over the lifetime of smokers (23.1%), 2.47 million QALYs are saved at a cost savings of $500 per smoker who receives the service.
