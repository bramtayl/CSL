11003,Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination standing order programs,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the benefits of vaccination and guidelines for their use, the rates for influenza and pneumococcal vaccination remain below the 90% goal set by Healthy People 2010 for persons 65 years and older. Standing order programs (SOPs) authorize vaccination administration without physician orders. Here we examine the cost-effectiveness of SOPs to improve both pneumococcal and influenza vaccination rates in outpatient settings for individuals 65 years and older. STUDY DESIGN: Decision analysis-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of outpatient SOPs for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) and influenza vaccination in hypothetical US population cohorts 65 years and older. Vaccination rate improvement data were obtained from the medical literature. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Active Bacterial Core surveillance data and US national databases were used to estimate costs and outcomes. RESULTS: SOPs cost $14,171 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with no program from a third-party payer perspective. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, the SOP strategy cost less than $50,000/QALY if SOPs increased absolute vaccination rates by 4% or more (base case: 18%), annual SOP costs were less than $21 per person (base case: $4.60), or annual influenza incidence was 4% or more (base case: 10%). Model results were insensitive to other individual parameter variations, and were supported by a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: SOPs used to improve PPSV and influenza vaccination rates in outpatient settings is a promising and economically favorable investment, with cost-effectiveness analysis results remaining robust to parameter variation over clinically plausible ranges.",2013-01-10847,23379777,Am J Manag Care,Chyongchiou Jeng Lin,2013,19 / 1,e30-7,No,23379777,"Chyongchiou Jeng Lin; Richard K Zimmerman; Kenneth J Smith; Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal and influenza vaccination standing order programs, Am J Manag Care, ; 19(1):1096-1860; e30-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Standing Order program (SOP) for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and influenza immunization in outpatient practice vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,14171,United States,2011,16304.91
11004,Cost utility analysis of reduced intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in adolescence and young adult with severe thalassemia compared to hypertransfusion and iron chelation program,"BACKGROUND: Hematopoieticic stem cell transplantation is the only therapeutic option that can cure thalassemia disease. Reduced intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (RI-HSCT) has demonstrated a high cure rate with minimal complications compared to other options. Because RI-HSCT is very costly, economic justification for its value is needed. This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of RI-HSCT compared with blood transfusions combined with iron chelating therapy (BT-ICT) for adolescent and young adult with severe thalassemia in Thailand. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes over the patients'' lifetimes using a societal perspective. All future costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per annum. The efficacy of RI-HSCT was based a clinical trial including a total of 18 thalassemia patients. Utility values were derived directly from all patients using EQ-5D and SF-6D. Primary outcomes of interest were lifetime costs, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in US ($) per QALY gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to investigate the effect of parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: In base case analysis, the RI-HSCT group had a better clinical outcomes and higher lifetime costs. The incremental cost per QALY gained was US $3,236 per QALY. The acceptability curve showed that the probability of RI-HSCT being cost-effective was 71% at the willingness to pay of 1 time of Thai Gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita), approximately US $4,210 per QALY gained. The most sensitive parameter was utility of severe thalassemia patients without cardiac complication patients. CONCLUSION: At a societal willingness to pay of 1 GDP per capita, RI-HSCT was a cost-effective treatment for adolescent and young adult with severe thalassemia in Thailand compared to BT-ICT.",2013-01-10849,23379888,BMC Health Serv Res,Rosarin Sruamsiri,2013,13 /,45,Yes,23379888,"Rosarin Sruamsiri; Nathorn Chaiyakunapruk; Samart Pakakasama; Somtawin Sirireung; Nintita Sripaiboonkij; Udomsak Bunworasate; Suradej Hongeng; Cost utility analysis of reduced intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in adolescence and young adult with severe thalassemia compared to hypertransfusion and iron chelation program, BMC Health Serv Res, ; 13():1472-6963; 45",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Reduced intensity hemapoietic stem cell transplantation vs. Blood transfusion combined with subcutaneous iron chelating therapy,Not Stated,18 Years,9 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,3236.37,United States,2011,3723.71
11005,Disease-modifying drugs for knee osteoarthritis: can they be cost-effective?,"OBJECTIVE: Disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) are under development. Our goal was to determine efficacy, toxicity, and cost thresholds under which DMOADs would be a cost-effective knee OA treatment. DESIGN: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy Model, a validated computer simulation of knee OA, to compare guideline-concordant care to strategies that insert DMOADs into the care sequence. The guideline-concordant care sequence included conservative pain management, corticosteroid injections, total knee replacement (TKR), and revision TKR. Base case DMOAD characteristics included: 50% chance of suspending progression in the first year (resumption rate of 10% thereafter) and 30% pain relief among those with suspended progression; 0.5%/year risk of major toxicity; and costs of $1,000/year. In sensitivity analyses, we varied suspended progression (20-100%), pain relief (10-100%), major toxicity (0.1-2%), and cost ($1,000-$7,000). Outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and TKR utilization. RESULTS: Base case DMOADs added 4.00 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and $230,000 per 100 persons, with an ICER of $57,500/QALY. DMOADs reduced need for TKR by 15%. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to likelihoods of suspended progression and pain relief. DMOADs costing $3,000/year achieved ICERs below $100,000/QALY if the likelihoods of suspended progression and pain relief were 20% and 70%. At a cost of $5,000, these ICERs were attained if the likelihoods of suspended progression and pain relief were both 60%. CONCLUSIONS: Cost, suspended progression, and pain relief are key drivers of value for DMOADs. Plausible combinations of these factors could reduce need for TKR and satisfy commonly cited cost-effectiveness criteria.",2013-01-10850,23380251,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,E Losina,2013,21 / 5,655-67,No,23380251,"E Losina; M E Daigle; L G Suter; D J Hunter; D H Solomon; R P Walensky; J M Jordan; S A Burbine; A D Paltiel; J N Katz; Disease-modifying drugs for knee osteoarthritis: can they be cost-effective?, Osteoarthritis Cartilage, ; 21(5):1063-4584; 655-67",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Standard care plus disease modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) as the second-line regimen vs. Standard/Usual care- conservative pain management, Corticosteroid injections, primary total knee replacement (TKR), revision TKR","50 % suspended progression of OA and 30% pain relief, overall 15% pain relief",Not Stated,25 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,57500,United States,2010,68246.84

METHODS: Efficacy and safety data were derived from a 20-week multi-centre randomized controlled head-to-head clinical trial comparing insulin detemir and NPH insulin in insulin naive people with T2DM, and short-term (1-year) cost effectiveness analyses were performed. As no significant differences in HbA1c were observed between the two treatment arms, the model was based on significant differences in favour of insulin detemir in frequency of hypoglycaemia (Rate-Ratio = 0.52; CI = 0.44-0.61) and weight gain (Delta = 0.9 kg). Model outcomes were measured in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) using published utility estimates. Acquisition costs for insulin and direct healthcare costs associated with non-severe hypoglycaemic events were obtained from National Health Service public sources. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Based on lower incidence of non-severe hypoglycaemic events and less weight gain, the QALY gain from initiating treatment with insulin detemir compared with NPH insulin was 0.01 per patient per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the individual countries were: Denmark, Danish Kroner 170,852 (euro22,933); Finland, euro28,349; Norway, Norwegian Kroner 169,789 (euro21,768); and Sweden, Swedish Krona 226,622 (euro25,097) per QALY gained. Possible limitations of the study are that data on hypoglycaemia and relative weight benefits from a clinical trial were combined with hypoglycaemia incidence data from observational studies. These populations may have slightly different patient characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: The lower risk of non-severe hypoglycaemia and less weight gain associated with using insulin detemir compared with NPH insulin when initiating insulin treatment in insulin naive patients with type 2 diabetes provide economic benefits in the short-term.

11010,Economic evaluation of universal newborn hepatitis B vaccination in China,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of universal newborn hepatitis B vaccination in China, an area of high endemicity. METHOD: A decision tree was used to describe perinatal hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission, early infection and impact of vaccination. A Markov model based on 1-year cycles was used to simulate these impacts for the lifetime of a cohort of 10,000,000 infants born in 2002 in China. We compared both cost and health outcomes for two strategies: universal newborn vaccination comprising a timely birth dose (HepB1) with a three-dose vaccination (HepB3) compared with no vaccination. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Over the cohort''s lifetime, 79,966 chronic infections, 37,553 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 130,796 HBV related deaths would be prevented by universal infant vaccination. The prevalence of HBV infection is reduced by 76%. Over 743,000 life-years and 620,000 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) would be gained and there would be monetary benefits of more than 1 billion US dollars in medical care costs and lost productivity avoided.

Roflumilast, an oral, selective phosphodiesterase-4-inhibitor reduces exacerbations and improves lung function in severe/very severe COPD patients with a history of exacerbations. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cost and outcomes of roflumilast added-on to commonly used COPD regimens in Switzerland. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate COPD progression in patients with disease states of severe, very severe COPD, and death. The exacerbation rate was assumed to be two per year in severe COPD. COPD progression rates were drawn from the published literature. Efficacy was expressed as relative ratios of exacerbation rates associated with roflumilast, derived from a mixed-treatment comparison. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for roflumilast added to long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), long-acting beta2-agonist/ inhaled corticosteroids (LABA/ICS), and LAMA + LABA/ICS. The analysis was conducted from the Swiss payer perspective, with costs and outcomes discounted at 2.5% annually. Parameter uncertainties were explored in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In each of the comparator regimens mean life expectancy was 9.28 years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were 6.19. Mean estimated lifetime costs per patient in the comparator arms were CHF 83,364 (LAMA), CHF 88,161 (LABA/ICS), and CHF 95,564 (LAMA + LABA/ICS) respectively. Adding roflumilast resulted in a mean cost per patient per lifetime of CHF 86,754 (LAMA + roflumilast), CHF 91,470 (LABA/ICS + roflumilast), and CHF 99,364 (LAMA + LABA/ICS + roflumilast), respectively. Life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy were 9.63 years and 6.47 QALYs (LAMA + roflumilast), 9.64 years and 6.48 QALYs (LABA/ICS + roflumilast), and 9.63 years and 6.47 QALYs (LAMA + LABA/ ICS + roflumilast). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were CHF 12,313, CHF 11,456, and CHF 13,671 per QALY when roflumilast was added to the three regimens.

A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for roflumilast added to long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA), long-acting beta2-agonist/ inhaled corticosteroids (LABA/ICS), and LAMA + LABA/ICS. The analysis was conducted from the Swiss payer perspective, with costs and outcomes discounted at 2.5% annually.

11013,Cost-effectiveness of roflumilast in combination with bronchodilator therapies in patients with severe and very severe COPD in Switzerland,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) represents a burden on patients and health systems. Roflumilast, an oral, selective phosphodiesterase-4-inhibitor reduces exacerbations and improves lung function in severe/very severe COPD patients with a history of exacerbations. This study aimed to estimate the lifetime cost and outcomes of roflumilast added-on to commonly used COPD regimens in Switzerland. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to simulate COPD progression in patients with disease states of severe, very severe COPD, and death. The exacerbation rate was assumed to be two per year in severe COPD. COPD progression rates were drawn from the published literature. Efficacy was expressed as relative ratios of exacerbation rates associated with roflumilast, derived from a mixed-treatment comparison.

11014,Markov model and cost-effectiveness analysis of bevacizumab in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer,"PURPOSE: Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) remains an incurable disease despite advances in treatment modalities. In 2008, the FDA approved bevacizumab with paclitaxel for the initial treatment of HER2-negative MBC. The approval was then officially revoked by the FDA in November 2011. However, both the European Medicines Agency and NCCN still endorse bevacizumab for this indication. One of the greatest challenges facing health care worldwide is reconciling incremental clinical benefits with exponentially rising costs. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab with paclitaxel for HER2-negative MBC. METHODS: A Markov decision tree using Data 3.5 (TreeAge Software Inc.) was created for decision and cost-effectiveness analyses of using bevacizumab plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone as first-line chemotherapy in HER2-negative MBC using efficacy and toxicity data from the E2100 study. The model was designed from the patient and payer perspectives and sensitivity analyses were run. RESULTS: The marginal cost between paclitaxel alone versus bevacizumab and paclitaxel was 86k with a marginal efficacy of 0.369 quality-adjusted life-years and marginal cost effectiveness of 232,720.72 USD. The expected outcome value was 1.86 for bevacizumab and paclitaxel and 1.67 for paclitaxel alone. The combination was not cost effective and only a marginal survival advantage was observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that, despite a significant progression-free survival advantage, the addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel is not cost effective for the cohort of patients with HER2-negative MBC included in our analysis. Such data could be informative to policymakers who consider the health economics and incremental cost-effectiveness of medical therapies.",2013-01-10863,23388565,Am J Clin Oncol,Tamer Refaat,2014,37 / 5,,No,23388565,"Tamer Refaat; Mehee Choi; Germaine Gaber; Krystyna Kiel; Minesh Mehta; William Gradishar; William Jr Small; Markov model and cost-effectiveness analysis of bevacizumab in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, Am J Clin Oncol, 2014 Oct; 37(5):1537-453X",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Paclitaxel based chemotherapy for first line therapy vs. Bevacizumab plus paclitaxel based chemotherapy for first line therapy,Treatment naïve patients,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,232720.72,United States,2010,276216.58
11015,The impact of timing and prioritization on the cost-effectiveness of birth cohort testing and treatment for hepatitis C virus in the United States,"Recent United States guidelines recommend one-time birth cohort testing for hepatitis C infection in persons born between 1945 and 1965; this represents a major public health policy undertaking. The purpose of this study was to assess the role of treatment timing and prioritization on predicted cost-effectiveness. The MONARCH hepatitis C lifetime simulation model was used in conjunction with a testing and treatment decision tree to estimate the cost-effectiveness of birth cohort versus risk-based testing incorporating information on age, fibrosis stage and treatment timing. The study used a 1945-1965 birth cohort and included disease progression, testing and treatment-related parameters. Scenario analysis was used to evaluate the impact of hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence, treatment eligibility, age, fibrosis stage and timing of treatment initiation on total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), HCV-related complications and cost-effectiveness. The cost-effectiveness of birth cohort versus risk-based testing was $28,602. Assuming 91% of the population is tested, at least 278,000 people need to be treated for birth cohort testing to maintain cost-effectiveness. Prioritizing treatment toward those with more advanced fibrosis is associated with a decrease in total cost of $7.5 billion and 59,035 fewer HCV-related complications. Total QALYs and complications avoided are maximized when treatment initiation occurs as soon as possible after testing. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that birth cohort testing is, on average, cost-effective. However, this remains true only when enough tested and HCV-positive subjects are treated to generate sufficient cost offsets and QALY gains. Given the practical and financial challenges associated with implementing birth cohort testing, the greatest return on investment is obtained when eligible patients are treated immediately and those with more advanced disease are prioritized.",2013-01-10865,23389841,Hepatology,Phil McEwan,2013,58 / 1,54-64,No,23389841,"Phil McEwan; Thomas Ward; Yong Yuan; Ray Kim; Gilbert L'italien; The impact of timing and prioritization on the cost-effectiveness of birth cohort testing and treatment for hepatitis C virus in the United States, Hepatology, ; 58(1):0270-9139; 54-64",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Birth cohort testing strategy for hepatitis C virus infection vs. Risk based testing strategy,persons born between 1945 and 1965,64 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,28602,United States,2011,32908.98
11016,Inclusion of the benefits of enhanced cross-protection against cervical cancer and prevention of genital warts in the cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Infection with HPV 16 and 18, the major causative agents of cervical cancer, can be prevented through vaccination with a bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine. Both vaccines provide cross-protection against HPV-types not included in the vaccines. In particular, the bivalent vaccine provides additional protection against HPV 31, 33, and 45 and the quadrivalent vaccine against HPV31. The quadrivalent vaccine additionally protects against low-risk HPV type 6 and 11, responsible for most cases of genital warts. In this study, we made an analytical comparison of the two vaccines in terms of cost-effectiveness including the additional benefits of cross-protection and protection against genital warts in comparison with a screening-only strategy. METHODS: We used a Markov model, simulating the progression from HPV infection to cervical cancer or genital warts. The model was used to estimate the difference in future costs and health effects of both HPV-vaccines separately. RESULTS: In a cohort of 100,000 women, use of the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine (both at 50% vaccination coverage) reduces the cervical cancer incidence by 221 and 207 cases, corresponding to ICERs of euro17,600/QALY and euro18,900/QALY, respectively. It was estimated that the quadrivalent vaccine additionally prevents 4390 cases of genital warts, reducing the ICER to euro16,300/QALY. Assuming a comparable willingness to pay for cancer and genital warts prevention, the difference in ICERs could justify a slightly higher price (~7% per dose) in favor of the quadrivalent vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Clearly, HPV vaccination has been implemented for the prevention of cervical cancer. From this perspective, use of the bivalent HPV vaccine appears to be most effective and cost-effective. Including the benefits of prevention against genital warts, the ICER of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was found to be slightly more favourable. However, current decision-making on the introduction of HPV is driven by the primary cervical cancer outcome.

11018,Cost-effectiveness of efavirenz vs rilpivirine in HIV patients initiating first-line combination antiretroviral therapy,"In US treatment guidelines, efavirenz (EFV) is the preferred non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) for first-line HIV treatment. In the ECHO and THRIVE trials comparing EFV with another NNRTI, rilpivirine (RPV), both medications had similar virologic suppression rates at 96-weeks; however, RPV had higher rates of virologic failure and drug resistance and lower rates of discontinuation due to adverse events. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of EFV to RPV in first-line HIV treatment in the US.A Markov model with 14 health states was constructed to estimate 10-year costs and clinical outcomes from a US payer perspective for antiretroviral na?ve HIV patients initiating EFV or RPV. First-line efficacy data came from 96-week results of the ECHO and THRIVE trials, which compared EFV and RPV, both in combination with two nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Other clinical inputs, mortality rates, and costs (2011 US$) came from published sources. Subsequent therapy lines (second, third, non-suppressive) were based on US treatment guidelines and common to both treatment arms. Robustness of study results was assessed in sensitivity analyses varying model inputs by ?25%. Potential limitations of the model center on the ability of any model to capture the clinical complexity of HIV treatment.In the base case, 10-year costs were lower for EFV compared to RPV ($214,031 vs $222,090). Life expectancy (8.44 years) and years without AIDS (8.40 years) were equal; years in virologic suppression were similar (EFV?=?7.87 years, RPV?=?7.86 years). EFV had modest cost savings compared to RPV in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness per life-year gained, life-year gained in viral suppression, and life-year gained without AIDS. In sensitivity analyses, EFV remained cost-saving compared to RPV in over 90% of scenarios, demonstrating the robustness of study results.EFV was predicted to be modestly cost-saving compared with RPV over 10 years in US patients initiating first-line HIV treatment.

The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effective diagnostic strategy that will identify the epileptogenic zone in patients with suspected focal intractable epilepsy and normal MR imaging findings by using decision analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed by using sensitivities and specificities of test strategies, seizure outcomes following surgical and medical treatment, cost, utilities, probabilities, and standardized mortality ratios. We compared 6 diagnostic test strategies: PET, ictal SPECT, and MEG individually; and combinations of PET+SPECT, PET+MEG, and SPECT+MEG. The outcomes measured were health care costs, QALY, and ICER.

The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effective diagnostic strategy that will identify the epileptogenic zone in patients with suspected focal intractable epilepsy and normal MR imaging findings by using decision analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed by using sensitivities and specificities of test strategies, seizure outcomes following surgical and medical treatment, cost, utilities, probabilities, and standardized mortality ratios. We compared 6 diagnostic test strategies: PET, ictal SPECT, and MEG individually; and combinations of PET+SPECT, PET+MEG, and SPECT+MEG. The outcomes measured were health care costs, QALY, and ICER. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to adjust for uncertainties in model parameters. RESULTS: The preferred strategies were PET+MEG and SPECT. The health care cost of the baseline strategy (PET+MEG) was $95,612 with 16.30 QALY gained. SPECT cost $97,479 with 16.45 QALY gained and an ICER of $12,934/QALY gained compared with those in PET+MEG. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the decisions of the model were sensitive to variations in sensitivity and specificity of the test strategies. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that when the willingness to pay was <$10,000, PET+MEG was the favored strategy, but the favored strategy changed to SPECT when the willingness to pay was >$10,000. CONCLUSIONS: PET+MEG and SPECT were the preferred strategies in the base case. The choice of test was dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of test strategies and willingness to pay.

11024,Cost-effectiveness of screening for chronic hepatitis C infection in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the most common chronic blood-borne infection in the United States and will become an increasing source of morbidity and mortality with aging of the infected population. Our objective was to develop decision analytic models to explore the cost-effectiveness of screening in populations with varying prevalence of HCV and risks for fibrosis progression. METHODS: We developed a Markov state transition model to examine screening of an asymptomatic community-based population in the United States. The base case was an ethnically and gender-mixed adult population with no prior knowledge of HCV status. Interventions were screening followed by guideline-based treatment, or no screening. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs were measured in 2011 US dollars. RESULTS: In the base case (US population, 49% male, 78% white, 13% African American, and 9% Hispanic, mean age, 46 years), screening followed by guideline-based treatment (using boceprevir as the direct-acting antiviral agent) of those with chronic HCV infection costs $47 276 per QALY. The overall HCV prevalence in the United States is reported to be 1.3%-1.9%, but prevalence varies markedly among patients with different numbers and types of risk factors. The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (mCER) of screening decreases as prevalence increases. Below a prevalence of 0.84%, the mCER is greater than the generally accepted societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY and thus is not considered highly cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted screening is cost-effective when prevalence of HCV exceeds 0.84%.

11025,Cost-effectiveness of roflumilast as an add-on treatment to long-acting bronchodilators in the treatment of COPD associated with chronic bronchitis in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, roflumilast, to a long-acting bronchodilator therapy (LABA) for the treatment of patients with severe-to-very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with chronic bronchitis with a history of frequent exacerbations from the UK payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to predict the lifetime cost and outcomes [exacerbations rates, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY)] in patients treated with roflumilast, which showed a reduction in the exacerbation rates and lung function improvement in a pooled analysis from two clinical trials, M2-124 and M2-125. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties on the cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The addition of roflumilast to concomitant LABA reduced the number of exacerbations from 15.6 to 12.7 [2.9 (95 % CI 0.88-4.92) exacerbations avoided] and increased QALYs from 5.45 to 5.61 [0.16 (95 % CI 0.02-0.31) QALYs gained], at an incremental cost of pound3,197 (95 % CI pound2,135- pound4,253). Cost in LABA alone and LABA + roflumilast were pound16,161 and pound19,358 respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in the base case were pound19,505 (95 % CI pound364- pound38,646) per quality-adjusted life-year gained and 18,219 (95 % CI pound12,697- pound49,135) per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses suggest that among the main determinants of cost-effectiveness are the reduction of exacerbations and the case fatality rate due to hospital-treated exacerbations. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that the probability of roflumilast being cost-effective is 82 % at willingness-to-pay pound30,000 per QALY.

11026,The cost-effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemoradiation is superior to a surgery-first approach in the treatment of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma,"BACKGROUND: In treating pancreatic cancer, there is no clearly defined optimal sequence of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. Therefore, cost-effectiveness should be considered. The objective of this study was to compare cost and outcomes between a surgery-first approach versus neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery for resectable pancreatic head cancer. METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed to compare the 2 approaches. Data from the National Cancer Database, National Surgical Quality Improvement Program, and literature populated the surgery-first arm. Data from our prospectively maintained institutional pancreatic cancer database populated the neoadjuvant arm. Costs were estimated by Medicare payment (2011 U.S. dollars). Survival was reported in quality-adjusted life-months (QALMs). RESULTS: The neoadjuvant chemoradiation arm consisted of 164 patients who completed preoperative therapy. Of these, 36 (22 %) did not proceed to surgery; 12 (7 %) underwent laparotomy but had unresectable disease; and 116 (71 %) underwent definitive resection. The surgery-first approach cost $46,830 and yielded survival of 8.7 QALMs; the neoadjuvant chemoradiation approach cost $36,583 and yielded survival of 18.8 QALMs. In the neoadjuvant arm, costs and survival times for patients not undergoing surgery, those with unresectable disease at laparotomy, and those completing surgery were $12,401 and 7.7 QALMs, $20,380 and 7.1 QALMs, and $45,673 and 23.4 QALMs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant chemoradiation for pancreatic cancer identifies patients with early metastases or poor performance status, who can be spared an ineffective or prohibitively morbid operation, and is associated with improved survival at significantly lower cost than a surgery-first approach. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery is a strategy that provides more cost-effective care than a surgery-first approach.",2013-01-10878,23397153,Ann Surg Oncol,Daniel E Abbott,2013,20 Suppl 3 /,,No,23397153,"Daniel E Abbott; Ching-Wei David Tzeng; Ryan P Merkow; Scott B Cantor; George J Chang; Matthew Harold Katz; David J Bentrem; Karl Y Bilimoria; Christopher H Crane; Gauri R Varadhachary; James L Abbruzzese; Robert A Wolff; Jeffrey E Lee; Douglas B Evans; Jason B Fleming; The cost-effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemoradiation is superior to a surgery-first approach in the treatment of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, Ann Surg Oncol, 2013 Dec; 20 Suppl 3():1068-9265",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Neoadjuvant chemoradiation first approach followed by surgery vs. Surgery first approach,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-12184.3,United States,2011,-14019.05
11027,Cost-effectiveness and economic impact of the KineSpring (R) Knee Implant System in the treatment for knee osteoarthritis,"PURPOSE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness and economic impact of the KineSpring System in the treatment for knee osteoarthritis in Germany. METHODS: Functional outcome scores of the general German population and knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients under surgical treatments (HTO, UKA and TKA), conservative treatments and treatment with the KineSpring System were used to derive the utility scores for each group. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of each group were estimated using the utility scores. Finally, cost-utility analysis was performed using cost and QALYs data. The economic impact of knee OA in Germany was assessed in terms of annual total direct cost and indirect cost, total diseased population and potential QALYs saved with the KineSpring System. RESULTS: Assuming the durability of 10 years, the cost-utility ratio of the KineSpring System, surgical treatments and conservative treatments compared to no treatment in 2012 was euro>3,402/QALY, euro 4,899/QALY and euro 9,996/QALY, respectively. With even a lesser durability of 5 years, the cost-utility ratio of the KineSpring System maintained superiority over surgical treatments and conservative treatments (euro 7,327/QALY, euro 9,706/QALY and euro 10,467/QALY, respectively). The KineSpring System is a highly cost-effective alternative for knee osteoarthritis compared with the current accepted cost-effective threshold (willingness to pay) of $50,000 US/QALY gained.

11030,Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of a high- and a low-intensity smoking cessation intervention in Sweden: a randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of a high-intensity treatment (HIT) and a low-intensity treatment (LIT) for smoking cessation. METHODS: The societal and health care perspective economic evaluation was based on the reported number of quitters at 12-month follow-up (point prevalence) from a randomized controlled trial of 2 smoking cessation programs in Sweden. Future disease-related costs (in Swedish kronor [SEK] 2004; SEK7.35 = USD1) and health effects (in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) were estimated via a Markov model comprising lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease including stroke with costs and QALYs discounted 3% annually. RESULTS: HIT was more effective than LIT (23% vs. 16% quitters), but at a considerably higher intervention cost: SEK26,100 versus 9,100 per quitter. The model-estimated societal costs avoided did not balance the higher intervention costs, so the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) amounted to SEK100,000 per QALY for HIT versus LIT. All sensitivity analyses indicated an ICER below SEK300,000 and that HIT is the preferred option if the decision maker willingness-to-pay exceeds SEK50,000 per QALY. Compared with no intervention, LIT was cost saving, whereas HIT was estimated at SEK8,400 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with no smoking cessation program, it is a societal waste not to implement the LIT as it is estimated to result in lower societal costs. The incremental cost per QALY gained of SEK100,000 for HIT is considered very cost-effective in Sweden. Thus, if smoking cessation programs are judged in the same manner as other Swedish health care measures, the high-intensity program should be chosen before the low-cost program.",2013-01-10899,23404735,Nicotine Tob Res,Eva Nohlert,2013,15 / 9,,No,23404735,"Eva Nohlert; Asgeir R Helgason; Per Tillgren; Ake Tegelberg; Pia Johansson; Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of a high- and a low-intensity smoking cessation intervention in Sweden: a randomized trial, Nicotine Tob Res, 2013 Sep; 15(9):1462-2203",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,"High intensity treatment for smoking cessation including eight individual sessions of totally 3.5 hr over a period of 4 months based on behavior therapy, coaching, and pharmacological advice vs. Low intensity treatment for smoking cessation including one counseling session of up to 45 min introducing a conventional self-help program running over 8 weeks",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,3.00,3.00,53100,Sweden,2004,9917.72
11031,Cost-effectiveness of vaccination against meningococcal B among Dutch infants: Crucial impact of changes in incidence,"OBJECTIVE: Recently, a vaccine with the capacity to protect against serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) disease received a positive opinion of the European Medicines Agency. Previously, such a vaccine was estimated to be cost-effective. However, since then, the MenB disease incidence has declined drastically in the Netherlands. Therefore, we re-assessed the potential incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccinating infants in the Netherlands with a MenB vaccine. RESULTS: Routine infant vaccination (2, 3, 4+11 mo) could prevent 39 cases of MenB disease in a single birth cohort, corresponding to a total gain of 133 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). However, this strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective if the vaccine costs euro40 per dose (euro243,778 per QALY). At a disease incidence of 5.7 per 100,000 person-years or a vaccine price of euro10 per dose including administration costs, the ICER becomes more acceptable and remains below a threshold of euro50,000 per QALY. METHODS: A cohort of 185,000 Dutch newborns was followed in a Markov model to compare routine vaccination against MenB disease with no vaccination. The ICER was estimated for different disease incidences. The study was performed from a societal perspective. CONCLUSIONS: At the current low level of disease incidence, introduction of routine infant vaccination, following a 2, 3, 4+11 mo schedule, against MenB disease is unlikely cost-effective in the Netherlands.

11032,Cost-utility of pregabalin as add-on to usual care versus usual care alone in the management of peripheral neuropathic pain in Belgium,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The cost effectiveness of pregabalin as an add-on to the standard treatment of Belgian patients with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) had been demonstrated in a previously published Markov model. The purpose of this study was to update that model with more recent cost data and clinical evidence, and reevaluate the cost effectiveness from the payer''s perspective of add-on pregabalin in a wider set of NeP conditions. METHODS: The model, featuring 4-week cycles and a 1-year time horizon, consisted in four possible health states: mild, moderate or severe pain and withdrawn from therapy. Three versions of the model were developed, using transition probabilities derived from pain scores reported in three placebo-controlled studies. The two treatment arms were ''usual care'' or ''usual care + pregabalin''. Resource use and utility data were obtained from a chart review and unit costs from recent published data. The final outcome of the model was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained when adding pregabalin to standard care. RESULTS: Based on 1000 simulations, two versions of the model showed that pregabalin was dominant respectively in 94.8% and 67.2% of the simulations, while the incremental cost per QALY was below euro32,000/QALY in respectively 99.1% and 94.6% of the simulations. The third version did not show cost effectiveness, despite an incremental cost of only euro300 after 1 year. However, in the corresponding study, patients seemed less responsive to GABA analogs, since 55% of them had failed to respond to gabapentin before study inclusion. LIMITATIONS: The studies upon which the model is based have a short follow-up time as compared to the model horizon. The endpoints of two studies were only provided at the aggregated level and do not necessarily reflect the real practice. CONCLUSION: Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that from a Belgium payer perspective pregabalin offers a slight increase in quality of life in the studied populations as compared to standard care. Pregabalin is cost effective in the majority of cases except in one published clinical study, despite a low incremental cost per year (euro300).",2013-01-10908,23409950,J Med Econ,Pierre Chevalier,2013,16 / 5,596-605,Yes,23409950,"Pierre Chevalier; Mark Lamotte; Hilde Van Campenhout; Roman Eyckerman; Lieven Annemans; Cost-utility of pregabalin as add-on to usual care versus usual care alone in the management of peripheral neuropathic pain in Belgium, J Med Econ, ; 16(5):1369-6998; 596-605",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pregabalin all doses (PGB)+ usual care (UC) vs. Standard/usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-39307.69,Euro,2011,-62936.57

We compared a multi-component delirium prevention intervention with usual care using a model based on a decision tree analysis. The model was used to estimate the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB). The robustness of the cost-effectiveness result was explored using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The multi-component prevention intervention was cost-effective when compared to usual care. It was associated with an INMB of pound8,180 using a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20,000 per QALY. It remained cost-effective in the majority of the deterministic sensitivity analyses and was cost-effective in 96.4 % of the simulations carried out in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

11034,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of escitalopram in major depressive disorder in Italy,"BACKGROUND: Depression has a lifetime prevalence of 10%-25% among women and 5%-12% among men. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most used and the most cost-effective treatment for long-term major depressive disorder. Since the introduction of generic SSRIs, the costs of branded drugs have been questioned. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness (euro per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]) of escitalopram (which is still covered by a patent) compared with paroxetine, sertraline, and citalopram, the patents for which have expired. METHODS: A decision analytic model was adapted from the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical benefits agency model to reflect current clinical practice in the treatment of depression in Italy in collaboration with an expert panel of Italian psychiatrists and health economists. The population comprised patients with a first diagnosis of major depressive disorder and receiving for the first time one of the following SSRIs: escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, and citalopram. The time frame used was 12 months. Efficacy and utility data for the original model were validated by our expert panel. Local data were considered for resource utilization and for treatment costs based on the Lombardy region health service perspective. Several scenario simulations, oneway sensitivity analyses, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The base case scenario showed that escitalopram had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro4395 and euro1080 per QALY compared with sertraline and paroxetine, respectively. Escitalopram was dominant over citalopram, which was confirmed by most one-way sensitivity analyses. The escitalopram strategy gained 0.011 QALYs more than citalopram, 0.008 more than paroxetine, and around 0.007 more than sertraline. Monte Carlo simulations indicated that ICER values for escitalopram were centered around euro1100 and euro4400 per QALY compared with paroxetine and sertraline, respectively. Although there is no official cost-effectiveness threshold in Italy, the value of euro25,000 per QALY could be acceptable. All ICER values retrieved in all analyses were lower than this threshold. CONCLUSION: The findings from this cost-effectiveness analysis indicate that escitalopram could be accepted as a cost-effective strategy for the Lombardy region health service compared with the other SSRIs studied. The present assessment is based on ICER values resulting from this analysis, which are lower than the thresholds proposed by health care authorities in other European Union countries. These benefits are driven by the effectiveness of escitalopram, which result in an improved health-related quality of life, a higher probability of sustained remission, and better utilization of health care resources.

11037,Gastroprotection in low-dose aspirin users for primary and secondary prevention of ACS: results of a cost-effectiveness analysis including compliance,"PURPOSE: Low-dose aspirin (ASA) increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce these upper GI side effects, yet patient compliance to PPIs is low. We determined the cost-effectiveness of gastroprotective strategies in low-dose ASA users considering ASA and PPI compliance. METHODS: Using a Markov model we compared four strategies: no medication, ASA monotherapy, ASA+PPI co-therapy and a fixed combination of ASA and PPI for primary and secondary prevention of ACS. The risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), upper GI bleeding and dyspepsia was modeled as a function of compliance and the relative risk of developing these events while using medication. Costs, quality adjusted life years and number of ACS events were evaluated, applying a variable risk of upper GI bleeding. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For our base case patients using ASA for primary prevention of ACS no medication was superior to ASA monotherapy. PPI co-therapy was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] euro10,314) compared to no medication. In secondary prevention, PPI co-therapy was cost-effective (ICER euro563) while the fixed combination yielded an ICER < euro20,000 only in a population with elevated risk for upper GI bleeding or moderate PPI compliance. PPI co-therapy had the highest probability to be cost-effective in all scenarios. PPI use lowered the overall number of ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Considering compliance, PPI co-therapy is likely to be cost-effective in patients taking low dose ASA for primary and secondary prevention of ACS, given low PPI prices.

11045,Gastroprotection in low-dose aspirin users for primary and secondary prevention of ACS: results of a cost-effectiveness analysis including compliance,"PURPOSE: Low-dose aspirin (ASA) increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal (GI) complications. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce these upper GI side effects, yet patient compliance to PPIs is low. We determined the cost-effectiveness of gastroprotective strategies in low-dose ASA users considering ASA and PPI compliance. METHODS: Using a Markov model we compared four strategies: no medication, ASA monotherapy, ASA+PPI co-therapy and a fixed combination of ASA and PPI for primary and secondary prevention of ACS. The risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), upper GI bleeding and dyspepsia was modeled as a function of compliance and the relative risk of developing these events while using medication. Costs, quality adjusted life years and number of ACS events were evaluated, applying a variable risk of upper GI bleeding. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For our base case patients using ASA for primary prevention of ACS no medication was superior to ASA monotherapy. PPI co-therapy was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] euro10,314) compared to no medication. In secondary prevention, PPI co-therapy was cost-effective (ICER euro563) while the fixed combination yielded an ICER < euro20,000 only in a population with elevated risk for upper GI bleeding or moderate PPI compliance. PPI co-therapy had the highest probability to be cost-effective in all scenarios. PPI use lowered the overall number of ACS. CONCLUSIONS: Considering compliance, PPI co-therapy is likely to be cost-effective in patients taking low dose ASA for primary and secondary prevention of ACS, given low PPI prices.

11047,Cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) compared to standard medical care was evaluated in the Dutch cohort of patients with Fabry disease. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a life-time state-transition model. Transition probabilities, effectiveness data and costs were derived from retrospective data and prospective follow-up of the Dutch study cohort consisting of males and females aged 5-78 years. Intervention with ERT (either agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta) was compared to the standard medical care. The main outcome measures were years without end organ damage (renal, cardiac en cerebrovascular complications), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. RESULTS: Over a 70 year lifetime, an untreated Fabry patient will generate 55.0 years free of end-organ damage (53.5 years in males, 56.9 years in females) and 48.6 QALYs (47.8 in males, 49.7 in females). Starting ERT in a symptomatic patient increases the number of years free of end-organ damage by 1.5 year (1.6 in males, 1.3 in females), while the number of QALYs gained increases by a similar amount (1.7 in males, 1.4 in females). The costs of ERT starting in the symptomatic stage are between euro9 - euro10 million ( pound 7.9 - pound 8.8 million, $13.0- $14.5 million) during a patient''s lifetime. Consequently, the extra costs per additional year free of end-organ damage and the extra costs per additional QALY range from euro5.5 - euro7.5 million ( pound 4.8 - pound 6.6 million, $ 8.0 - $ 10.8 million), undiscounted. CONCLUSIONS: In symptomatic patients with Fabry disease, ERT has limited effect on quality of life and progression to end organ damage. The pharmaco-economic evaluation shows that this modest effectiveness drives the costs per QALY and the costs per year free of end-organ damage to millions of euros. Differentiation of patients who may benefit from ERT should be improved to enhance cost-effectiveness.",2013-01-10926,23421808,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Saskia M Rombach,2013,8 /,29,No,23421808,"Saskia M Rombach; Carla E M Hollak; Gabor E Linthorst; Marcel G W Dijkgraaf; Cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy for Fabry disease, Orphanet J Rare Dis, ; 8():1750-1172; 29",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Enzyme replacement therapy vs. Standard/Usual care,Not Stated,78 Years,5 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,3282252,Euro,2009,5517903.89
11048,Should Israel screen all mothers-to-be to prevent early-onset of neonatal group B streptococcal disease? A cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: In Israel, an average of 37 children are born each year with sepsis and another four with meningitis as a result of Group B Streptococcal (GBS) disease. Israel currently only screens mothers with defined risk factors (around 15% of all pregnancies) in order to identify candidates for Intrapartum Antiobiotic Prophyhlaxis (IAP) of GBS. This paper presents a cost-utility analysis of implementing an alternative strategy, which would expand the current protocol to one aiming to screen all pregnant women at 35-37 weeks gestation based on taking a vaginal culture for GBS. METHODS: A spreadsheet model was built incorporating technical, epidemiological, health service costs, demographic and economic data based primarily on Israeli sources. RESULTS: The intervention of universal screening (compared with the current scenario) would increase screening costs from 580,000 NIS to 3,278,000 million NIS. In addition, the intervention would also increase penicillin costs from 39,000 NIS to 221,000 NIS. Current culture screening of approximately 15% of mothers-to-be with high risk factors resulted in 42 GBS births in 2008-9 (0.253/1000 births). Expanding culture screening to 85% of mothers-to-be, will decrease the number of GBS births to 17.3 (0.104/1000 births). The initial 2.9 million NIS incremental intervention costs are offset by decreased treatment costs of 1.9 million NIS and work productivity gains of 811,000 NIS as a result of a decrease in neurological sequelae from GBS caused meningitis. Thus the resultant net cost of the intervention is only around 134,000 NIS. Culture based screening will reduce the burden of disease by 12.6 discounted Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYS), giving a very cost effective baseline incremental cost per QALY (cf. risk factor screening) of 10,641 NIS per QALY. The data was very sensitive to rates of anaphylactic shock and changes in the percentage of meningitis cases that had associated long term-sequelae. CONCLUSION: It is recommended that Israel adopt universal culture-based GBS screening.",2013-01-10930,23425020,Isr J Health Policy Res,Gary M Ginsberg,2013,2 / 1,6,No,23425020,"Gary M Ginsberg; Arthur I Eidelman; Eric Shinwell; Emilia Anis; Reuven Peyser; Yoram Lotan; Should Israel screen all mothers-to-be to prevent early-onset of neonatal group B streptococcal disease?

11049,Cost-utility analysis of a dance intervention for adolescent girls with internalizing problems,"BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescent girls is alarming. Knowledge of beneficial effects of physical activity on psychological health is widespread. Dance is a popular form of exercise that could be a protective factor in preventing and treating symptoms of depression. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a dance intervention in addition to usual school health services for adolescent girls with internalizing problems, compared with usual school health services alone. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective based on a randomized controlled intervention trial was performed. The setting was a city in central Sweden with a population of 130 000. A total of 112 adolescent girls, 13-18 years old, with internalizing problems participated in the study. They were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 59) or control (n = 53) group. The intervention comprised dance twice weekly during eight months in addition to usual school health services. Costs for the stakeholder of the intervention, treatment effect and healthcare costs were considered. Gained quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were used to measure the effects. Quality of life was measured with the Health Utility Index Mark 3. Cost-effectiveness ratios were based on the changes in QALYs and net costs for the intervention group compared with the control group. Likelihood of cost-effectiveness was calculated. RESULTS: At 20 months, quality of life had increased by 0.08 units more in the intervention group than in the control group (P = .04), translating to 0.10 gained QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was USD $3,830 per QALY and the likelihood of cost-effectiveness was 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention with dance twice weekly in addition to usual school health services may be considered cost-effective compared with usual school health services alone, for adolescent girls with internalizing problems.

11050,Antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients: a proposal to assess the economic value of the single-tablet regimen,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the economic value of a reduced number of pills in patients infected with the immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and on highly active antiretroviral therapy by a cost-effectiveness model. METHODS: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of efavirenz, tenofovir, and emtricitabine (TDF-FTC-EFV) as a single-tablet regimen versus a multipill regimen, with reference to untreated HIV-infected patients, was carried out from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. The comparisons were performed with the help of a Markov decision model over a 10-year time horizon. Based on the ADONE (ADherence to ONE pill) study, it was then possible to identify the utility score increment in patients switching from a multipill regimen of TDF-FTC + EFV therapy to a single-tablet regimen. RESULTS: The single-tablet regimen (0.755 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]/year) resulted in better patient quality of life, with a higher number of QALYs than for the TDF-FTC + EFV multipill regimen (0.716 QALYs/year). The single-tablet regimen was the most cost-effective treatment strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro22,017.00 versus euro26,558.00 for the multipill regimen. A 24% decrease in cost of the multipill regimen determined equivalence with the single-tablet regimen in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Univariate sensitivity and probabilistic analysis carried out on the main variables did not highlight significant variations with respect to the base case scenario. CONCLUSION: The single-tablet regimen resulted in better adherence, and therefore better quality of life as perceived by patients, corresponding to a euro4541.00 lower cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY versus the multipill regimen, with a 17% lower cost in favor of the single-tablet regimen.

BACKGROUND: There are evidence-based, guideline-directed medical therapies for patients with HFrEF, but the incremental cost-effectiveness of these therapies has not been well studied using contemporary data. METHODS: A Markov model with lifetime horizon and two states, dead or alive, was created. We compared HFrEF patients treated with diuretic agents alone to three treatment arms: 1) ACEI therapy alone; 2) ACEI+BB; and 3) ACEI+BB+AldA. Sequential therapy was also analyzed. HF hospitalizations and mortality rates were based on representative studies. Costs of medications and inpatient and outpatient care were accounted for. RESULTS: Treatment with ACEI and ACEI+BB strictly dominated treatment with diuretics only (cost-saving). The greatest gains in quality-adjusted life-years occurred when all 3 guideline-directed medications were provided. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ACEI+BB+AldA versus ACEI+BB and ACEI+BB versus ACEI was <$1,500 per quality-adjusted life-year. The cost-savings in the ACEI and ACEI+BB cohorts compared to that with diuretics alone were $444 and $33, respectively. Assuming lower treatment costs and lower hospitalization rates in the ACEI+BB+AldA arm resulted in greater cost-savings. Even in the most unfavorable situations, the ICER was <$10,000 per life-year gained.

11055,Surgical site infection prevention following total hip arthroplasty in Australia: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI) is associated with substantial costs for health services, reduced quality of life, and functional outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies claiming to reduce the risk of SSI in hip arthroplasty in Australia. METHODS: Baseline use of antibiotic prophylaxis (AP) was compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis (no AP), antibiotic-impregnated cement (AP + ABC), and laminar air operating rooms (AP + LOR). A Markov model was used to simulate long-term health and cost outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of 30,000 total hip arthroplasty patients from a health services perspective. Model parameters were informed by the best available evidence. Uncertainty was explored in probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses. RESULTS: Stopping the routine use of AP resulted in over Australian dollars (AUD) $1.5 million extra costs and a loss of 163 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Using antibiotic cement in addition to AP (AP + ABC) generated an extra 32 QALYs while saving over AUD $123,000. The use of laminar air operating rooms combined with routine AP (AP + LOR) resulted in an AUD $4.59 million cost increase and 127 QALYs lost compared with the baseline comparator.

RESULTS: Stopping the routine use of AP resulted in over Australian dollars (AUD) $1.5 million extra costs and a loss of 163 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Using antibiotic cement in addition to AP (AP + ABC) generated an extra 32 QALYs while saving over AUD $123,000. The use of laminar air operating rooms combined with routine AP (AP + LOR) resulted in an AUD $4.59 million cost increase and 127 QALYs lost compared with the baseline comparator.

11058,Cost-effectiveness of radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) versus wire-guided localization (WGL) in breast conserving surgery for nonpalpable breast cancer: results from a randomized controlled multicenter trial,"BACKGROUND: Accurate preoperative localization of nonpalpable breast cancer is essential to achieve complete resection. Radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) has been introduced as an alternative for wire-guided localization (WGL). Although efficacy of ROLL has been established in a randomized controlled trial, cost-effectiveness of ROLL compared with WGL is not yet known. The objective of this study was to determine whether ROLL has acceptable cost-effectiveness compared with WGL. METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed along with a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov, No. NCT00539474). Women (>18 years) with histologically proven nonpalpable breast cancer and eligible for breast conserving treatment with sentinel node procedure were randomized to ROLL (n = 162) or WGL (n = 152). Empirical data on direct medical costs were collected, and changes in quality of life were measured over a 6-month period. Bootstrapping was used to assess uncertainty in cost-effectiveness estimates, and sensitivity of the results to the missing data approach was investigated. RESULTS: In total, 314 patients with 316 invasive breast cancers were enrolled. On average ROLL required the same time as WGL for the surgical procedure (119 vs 118 min), resulted in a 7 % higher reinterventions risk, and 13 % more complications. Quality of life effects were similar (difference 0.00 QALYs 95 % CI (-0.04-0.05). Total costs were also similar for ROLL and WGL (+<euro>26 per patient 95 % CI <euro>-250-311). CONCLUSION: ROLL is comparable to WGL with respect to both costs and quality of life effects as measured with the EQ5D and will therefore not lead to more cost-effective medical care.",2013-01-10940,23435568,Ann Surg Oncol,E L Postma,2013,20 / 7,2219-26,No,23435568,"E L Postma; H Koffijberg; H M Verkooijen; A J Witkamp; M A A J van den Bosch; R van Hillegersberg; Cost-effectiveness of radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) versus wire-guided localization (WGL) in breast conserving surgery for nonpalpable breast cancer: results from a randomized controlled multicenter trial, Ann Surg Oncol, ; 20(7):1068-9265; 2219-26",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) in breast conserving surgery vs. Wire-guided localization (WGL),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Euro,2011,Not Stated
11059,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients with medically unexplained symptoms: a cost-effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess cost-effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) compared with enhanced usual care (EUC) in treating patients with persistent medically unexplained symptoms(MUS). METHODS: A full economic evaluation with a one year time horizon was performed from a societal perspective. Costs were assessed by prospective cost diaries. Health-related Quality of Life was measured using SF-6D. Outcomes were costs per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Bootstrap simulations were performed to obtain mean costs, QALY scores and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: MBCT participants (n=55) had lower hospital costs and higher mental health care costs than patients who received EUC (n=41). Mean bootstrapped costs for MBCT were euro6269, and euro5617 for EUC (95% uncertainty interval for difference: -euro1576; euro2955). QALYs were 0.674 for MBCT and 0.663 for EUC. MBCT was on average more effective and more costly than EUC, resulting in an ICER of euro56,637 per QALY gained. At a willingness to pay of euro80,000 per QALY, the probability that MBCT is cost-effective is 57%. CONCLUSION: Total costs were not statistically significantly different between MBCT and EUC. However, MBCT seemed to cause a shift in the use of health care resources as mental health care costs were higher and hospital care costs lower in the MBCT condition. Due to the higher drop-out in the EUC condition the cost-effectiveness of MBCT might have been underestimated. The shift in health care use might lead to more effective care for patients with persistent MUS. The longer-term impact of MBCT for patients with persistent MUS needs to be further studied.",2013-01-10943,23438709,J Psychosom Res,Hiske van Ravesteijn,2013,74 / 3,197-205,No,23438709,"Hiske van Ravesteijn; Janneke Grutters; Tim olde Hartman; Peter Lucassen; Hans Bor; Chris van Weel; Gert Jan van der Wilt; Anne Speckens; Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients with medically unexplained symptoms: a cost-effectiveness study, J Psychosom Res, ; 74(3):0022-3999; 197-205",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) vs. Enhanced usual care (EUC),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,56637,Euro,2010,88964.8
11060,Long-term health benefits and costs of measurement of carotid intima-media thickness in prevention of coronary heart disease,"OBJECTIVE: Recently, it was demonstrated that information on carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and plaque may improve coronary heart disease (CHD) risk prediction through reclassification of some individuals to the correct risk category using the Framingham risk score. Our objective was to assess the currently unknown cost-effectiveness of CIMT measurements in primary prevention. METHODS: A hypothetical cohort of men and women aged 50-59 years and at intermediate or high CHD risk based on data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study was simulated using a Markov model. Myocardial infarction (MI) events were used as a proxy for CHD. The effectiveness of pharmaceutical treatment was varied in the analysis. Sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain robust results. RESULTS: CIMT-based reclassification induced a 1% lower absolute risk of MI and 0.01-0.02 increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for men, and a 1-3% lower risk, and 0.03-0.05 increase in QALYs for women, over a period of 20-30 years. Corresponding costs were an additional $100 per man, and a cost-saving of $200-300 per woman. Over a 10-year period CIMT measurements were cost-effective with a probability of 66% (men), and 94% (women). Over a 30-year period, CIMT measurements had acceptable cost-effectiveness for men and women. CONCLUSION: Performing CIMT measurements in asymptomatic men and women aged 50-59 years results in additional, but small, health benefits.

11062,Cost effectiveness of a computer-delivered intervention to improve HIV medication adherence,"BACKGROUND: High levels of adherence to medications for HIV infection are essential for optimal clinical outcomes and to reduce viral transmission, but many patients do not achieve required levels. Clinician-delivered interventions can improve patients'' adherence, but usually require substantial effort by trained individuals and may not be widely available. Computer-delivered interventions can address this problem by reducing required staff time for delivery and by making the interventions widely available via the Internet. We previously developed a computer-delivered intervention designed to improve patients'' level of health literacy as a strategy to improve their HIV medication adherence. The intervention was shown to increase patients'' adherence, but it was not clear that the benefits resulting from the increase in adherence could justify the costs of developing and deploying the intervention. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation of development and deployment costs to the effectiveness of the intervention. METHODS: Costs of intervention development were drawn from accounting reports for the grant under which its development was supported, adjusted for costs primarily resulting from the project''s research purpose. Effectiveness of the intervention was drawn from results of the parent study. The relation of the intervention''s effects to changes in health status, expressed as utilities, was also evaluated in order to assess the net cost of the intervention in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses evaluated ranges of possible intervention effectiveness and durations of its effects, and costs were evaluated over several deployment scenarios. RESULTS: The intervention''s cost effectiveness depends largely on the number of persons using it and the duration of its effectiveness. Even with modest effects for a small number of patients the intervention was associated with net cost savings in some scenarios and for durations greater than three months and longer it was usually associated with a favorable cost per QALY. For intermediate and larger assumed effects and longer durations of intervention effectiveness, the intervention was associated with net cost savings.

DESIGN: Lifetime cost effectiveness model with parameters estimated from individual patient data obtained from three large national databases. SETTING: English National Health Service. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 55 to 84 undergoing primary total hip replacement for osteoarthritis. INTERVENTIONS: Total hip replacement using either cemented, cementless, or hybrid prostheses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost ( pound), quality of life (EQ-5D-3L, where 0 represents death and 1 perfect health), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost effectiveness ratios, and the probability that each prosthesis type is the most cost effective at alternative thresholds of willingness to pay for a QALY gain. RESULTS: Lifetime costs were generally lowest with cemented prostheses, and postoperative quality of life and lifetime QALYs were highest with hybrid prostheses. For example, in women aged 70 mean costs were pound6900 ($11 000; euro8200) for cemented prostheses, pound7800 for cementless prostheses, and pound7500 for hybrid prostheses; mean postoperative EQ-5D scores were 0.78, 0.80, and 0.81, and the corresponding lifetime QALYs were 9.0, 9.2, and 9.3 years.

For example, in women aged 70 mean costs were pound6900 ($11 000; euro8200) for cemented prostheses, pound7800 for cementless prostheses, and pound7500 for hybrid prostheses; mean postoperative EQ-5D scores were 0.78, 0.80, and 0.81, and the corresponding lifetime QALYs were 9.0, 9.2, and 9.3 years. The incremental cost per QALY for hybrid compared with cemented prostheses was pound2500. If the threshold willingness to pay for a QALY gain exceeded pound10 000, the probability that hybrid prostheses were most cost effective was about 70%. Hybrid prostheses have the highest probability of being the most cost effective in all subgroups, except in women aged 80, where cemented prostheses were most cost effective.

However, some beneficiaries have generic drug coverage in the gap. OBJECTIVES: To examine the health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of generic-drug coverage compared with no gap coverage in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. STUDY DESIGN: Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis using identical hypothetical cohorts to examine drug coverage strategies. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of Part D coverage strategies was estimated, using differences in medical costs and quality-adjusted life years between plans. Coverage strategy-specific costs and hospitalization rates were obtained from 2007 Medicare data, adjusted for age, sex, race, and health status. RESULTS: When comparing generic-only coverage with no gap coverage, generic-only coverage cost less and was more effective than no gap coverage, due mainly to lower hospitalization rates. In sensitivity analyses, generic-only coverage continued to be favored over no gap coverage unless generic coverage costs increased > 3% in bipolar disorder and > 5% in schizophrenia; generic coverage in the gap was also favored in probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

11075,Cost-effectiveness of additional catheter-directed thrombolysis for deep vein thrombosis,"BACKGROUND: Additional treatment with catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) has recently been shown to reduce post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost effectiveness of additional CDT compared with standard treatment alone. METHODS: Using a Markov decision model, we compared the two treatment strategies in patients with a high proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a low risk of bleeding. The model captured the development of PTS, recurrent venous thromboembolism and treatment-related adverse events within a lifetime horizon and the perspective of a third-party payer. Uncertainty was assessed with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes. Model inputs from the CaVenT study included PTS development, major bleeding from CDT and utilities for post DVT states including PTS. The remaining clinical inputs were obtained from the literature. Costs obtained from the CaVenT study, hospital accounts and the literature are expressed in US dollars ($); effects in quality adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: In base case analyzes, additional CDT accumulated 32.31 QALYs compared with 31.68 QALYs after standard treatment alone. Direct medical costs were $64,709 for additional CDT and $51,866 for standard treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $20,429/QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed model sensitivity to the clinical efficacy of both strategies, but the ICER remained < $55,000/QALY over the full range of all parameters. The probability that CDT is cost effective was 82% at a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained.

11076,Economic evaluation of fulvestrant 500 mg versus generic nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors in patients with advanced breast cancer in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of fulvestrant 500 mg for the treatment of first progression or recurrence of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal patients compared with generic nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole and letrozole) in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A cost-utility model based on a time-in-state approach was used. Clinical effectiveness estimates used in the model were derived from a network meta-analysis for overall survival and serious adverse events. Overall survival was extrapolated by using a Weibull distribution, and progression-free survival (PFS) estimates were derived from a simultaneous network meta-analysis and extrapolation of PFS curves by using the log-normal distribution. Data on resource use, costs, and utilities were based on various sources, including expert opinion and published data. To explore uncertainty, 1-way and probability sensitivity analyses were conducted. The study was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, and costs are reported in 2010/2011 British pounds. RESULTS: The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for fulvestrant 500 mg versus letrozole was pound34,528, with incremental costs of pound14,383 and an incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 0.417. Extended dominance occurred for anastrozole because the ICER for anastrozole versus letrozole was higher than the ICER for fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole. Based on the probability sensitivity analyses, the probability that fulvestrant 500 mg was the most cost-effective treatment option was 3%, 20%, and 53% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000, pound30,000, and pound40,000 per QALY, respectively. According to the 1-way sensitivity analyses, the PFS estimates were the key drivers of the model results. CONCLUSIONS: Although fulvestrant 500 mg was found not to be a cost-effective option at a standard UK threshold of pound20,000 to pound30,000 per QALY, it may be relevant to apply a higher threshold due to the poor prognosis of patients with advanced breast cancer and the limited number of hormonal treatment options available for this stage of treatment.

11079,The potential cost and benefits of raltegravir in simplified second-line therapy among HIV infected patients in Nigeria and South Africa,"BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need to improve the evidence base for provision of second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) following first-line virological failure. This is particularly the case in Sub-Saharan Africa where 70% of all people living with HIV/AIDS (PHA) reside. The aim of this study was to simulate the potential risks and benefits of treatment simplification in second-line therapy compared to the current standard of care (SOC) in a lower-middle income and an upper-middle income country in Sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to compare outcomes associated with reducing treatment discontinuations between current SOC for second-line therapy in South Africa and Nigeria and an alternative regimen: ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) combined with raltegravir (RAL). We used published studies and collaborating sites to estimate efficacy, adverse effect and cost. Model outcomes were reported as incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2011 USD per quality adjusted life year ($/QALY) gained. RESULTS: Reducing treatment discontinuations with LPV/r+RAL resulted in an additional 0.4 discounted QALYs and increased the undiscounted life expectancy by 0.8 years per person compared to the current SOC. The average incremental cost was $6,525 per treated patient in Nigeria and $4,409 per treated patient in South Africa. The cost-effectiveness ratios were $16,302/QALY gained and $11,085/QALY gained for Nigeria and South Africa, respectively. Our results were sensitive to the probability of ART discontinuation and the unit cost for RAL. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of raltegravir and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir was projected to be cost-effective in South Africa.

Model outcomes were reported as incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2011 USD per quality adjusted life year ($/QALY) gained. RESULTS: Reducing treatment discontinuations with LPV/r+RAL resulted in an additional 0.4 discounted QALYs and increased the undiscounted life expectancy by 0.8 years per person compared to the current SOC. The average incremental cost was $6,525 per treated patient in Nigeria and $4,409 per treated patient in South Africa. The cost-effectiveness ratios were $16,302/QALY gained and $11,085/QALY gained for Nigeria and South Africa, respectively. Our results were sensitive to the probability of ART discontinuation and the unit cost for RAL. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of raltegravir and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir was projected to be cost-effective in South Africa. However, at its current price, it is unlikely to be cost-effective in Nigeria.",2013-01-10971,23457450,PLoS One,Karen Schneider,2013,8 / 2,e54435,No,23457450,"Karen Schneider; Chidi Nwizu; Richard Kaplan; Jonathan Anderson; David P Wilson; Sean Emery; David A Cooper; Mark A Boyd; The potential cost and benefits of raltegravir in simplified second-line therapy among HIV infected patients in Nigeria and South Africa, PLoS One , ; 8(2):1932-6203; e54435",QALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lopinavir + Ritonavir (LPV/r) + Raltegravir as second line therapy vs. Standard/Usual care,N(t)RTI and NNRTI experienced with treatment failure,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,11085,United States,2011,12754.21
11081,Cost-utility analysis of lopinavir/ritonavir versus atazanavir + ritonavir administered as first-line therapy for the treatment of HIV infection in Italy: from randomised trial to real world,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime cost utility of two antiretroviral regimens (once-daily atazanavir plus ritonavir [ATV+r] versus twice-daily lopinavir/ritonavir [LPV/r]) in Italian human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients naive to treatment. DESIGN: With this observational retrospective study we collected the clinical data of a cohort of HIV-infected patients receiving first-line treatment with LPV/r or ATV+r. METHODOLOGY: A Markov microsimulation model including direct costs and health outcomes of first- and second-line highly active retroviral therapy was developed from a third-party (Italian National Healthcare Service) payer''s perspective. Health and monetary outcomes associated with the long-term use of ATV+r and LPV/r regimens were evaluated on the basis of eight health states, incidence of diarrhoea and hyperbilirubinemia, AIDS events, opportunistic infections, coronary heart disease events and, for the first time in an economic evaluation, chronic kidney disease (CKD) events. In order to account for possible deviations between real-life data and randomised controlled trial results, a second control arm (ATV+r 2) was created with differential transition probabilities taken from the literature. RESULTS: The average survival was 24.061 years for patients receiving LPV/r, 24.081 and 24.084 for those receiving ATV+r 1 and 2 respectively. The mean quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were higher for the patients receiving LPV/r than those receiving ATV+r (13.322 vs. 13.060 and 13.261 for ATV+r 1 and 2). The cost-utility values were 15,310.56 for LPV/r, 15,902.99 and 15,524.85 for ATV+r 1 and 2. CONCLUSIONS: Using real-life data, the model produced significantly different results compared with other studies. With the innovative addition of an evaluation of CKD events, the model showed a cost-utility value advantage for twice-daily LPV/r over once-daily ATV+r, thus providing evidence for its continued use in the treatment of HIV.",2013-01-10974,23460905,PLoS One,Emanuela Foglia,2013,8 / 2,e57777,No,23460905,"Emanuela Foglia; Paolo Bonfanti; Giuliano Rizzardini; Erminio Bonizzoni; Umberto Restelli; Elena Ricci; Emanuele Porazzi; Francesca Scolari; Davide Croce; Cost-utility analysis of lopinavir/ritonavir versus atazanavir + ritonavir administered as first-line therapy for the treatment of HIV infection in Italy: from randomised trial to real world, PLoS One , ; 8(2):1932-6203; e57777",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lopinavir/ritonavir vs. Atazanavir plus ritonavir (ATV+r 1),naïve treatment,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-1422137.38,Euro,2011,-2277021.07
11082,A Markov model of the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist care for diabetes in prevention of cardiovascular diseases: evidence from Kaiser Permanente Northern California,"BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated in previous studies that pharmacist management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the outpatient setting not only improves diabetes-related clinical outcomes such as hemoglobin A1c but also blood pressure (BP), total cholesterol (TC), and quality of life. Improved control of BP and TC has been shown to reduce the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which has placed a heavy economic burden on the health care system. However, no study has evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist intervention programs with respect to the long-term preventive effects on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients. OBJECTIVES: To (a) quantify the long-term preventive effects of pharmacist intervention on CVD outcomes among T2DM patients using evidence from a matched cohort study in the outpatient primary care setting and (b) assess the relative cost-effectiveness of adding a clinical pharmacist to the primary care team for the management of patients with T2DM based on improvement in CVD risks with the aid of an economic model. METHODS: Clinical data between the periods of June 2007 to February 2010 were collected from electronic medical records at 2 separate clinics at Kaiser Permanente (KP) Northern California, 1 with primary care physicians only (control group) and the other with the addition of a pharmacist (enhanced care group). Patients in the enhanced care group were matched 1:1 with patients in the control group according to baseline characteristics that included age, gender, A1c, and Charlson comorbidity score. The estimated 10-year CVD risk for both groups was calculated by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Risk Engine (version 2) based on age, sex, race, smoking status, atrial fibrillation, duration of diabetes, levels of A1c, systolic BP (SBP) and TC, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) observed at 12 months. There was no statistical difference in the baseline clinical inputs to the Risk Engine (A1c [P=0.115], SBP [P=0.184], TC [P=0.055], and HDL-C [P=0.475]) between the 2 groups. A Markov model was developed to simulate the estimated CVD outcomes over 10 years and to estimate cost-effectiveness. The final outcomes examined included incremental cost and effectiveness measured by life years and per quality-adjusted life year gained. Both deterministic sensitivity analysis (SA) and probabilistic SA were conducted to examine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The estimated risks for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke (both nonfatal and fatal) at the end of the follow-up were consistently lower in the enhanced care group compared with the control group, even though baseline risks in both groups were similar. The absolute risk reduction (ARR) between the enhanced care and control groups increased over time. For example, the ARR for nonfatal CHD risk in year 1 was 0.5% (1.2% vs. 0.7%), whereas the ARR increased to 5.5% in year 10 (14.8% vs. 9.3%). Similarly, the ARR between the enhanced care and the control groups was calculated as 0.3% for fatal CHD in year 1 and increased to 4.6% in year 10. Results from the Markov model suggest that the enhanced care group was shown to be a dominant strategy (less expensive and more effective) compared with the control group in the 10-year evaluation period in the base-case (average or mean results) scenario. Sensitivity analysis that took into account the uncertainty in all important variables, such as wage of pharmacists, utility weight (the degree of preference individuals have for a particular health state or condition), response rate to pharmacists'' care, and uncertainty associated with the estimated 10 years of CVD risk, revealed that the relative value of enhanced care was robust to most of the variations in these parameters. Notably, the level of cost-effectiveness measured by net monetary value depends on the time horizon adopted by the payers and the magnitude of CVD risk reduction. The enhanced care group has a higher chance of being considered as a cost-effective strategy when a longer time horizon such as a minimum of 4 to 5 years is adopted. CONCLUSIONS: Adding pharmacists to the health care management team for diabetic patients improves the long-term CVD risks. The longer-term CVD risk reductions were shown to be more dramatic than the short-term reduction. A longer time horizon adopted by health plans in managing T2DM patients has a higher probability of making the intervention cost-effective.",2013-01-10975,23461426,J Manag Care Pharm,Junhua Yu,2013,19 / 2,102-14,No,23461426,"Junhua Yu; Bijal M Shah; Eric J Ip; James Chan; A Markov model of the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist care for diabetes in prevention of cardiovascular diseases: evidence from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, J Manag Care Pharm, ; 19(2):1083-4087; 102-14",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Enhanced care group where patients were managed by a clinical pharmacist who was integrated as part of the primary care team as a provider vs. Usual care of primary care physicians,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,5.00,-17646.59,United States,2011,-20303.86

We examined the cost-effectiveness of qualitative point-of-care viral load tests (POC-VL) in sub-Saharan Africa. DESIGN: Mathematical model based on longitudinal data from the Gugulethu and Khayelitsha township ART programmes in Cape Town, South Africa. METHODS: Cohorts of patients on ART monitored by POC-VL, CD4 cell count or clinically were simulated. Scenario A considered the more accurate detection of treatment failure with POC-VL only, and scenario B also considered the effect on HIV transmission. Scenario C further assumed that the risk of virologic failure is halved with POC-VL due to improved adherence. We estimated the change in costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, ICERs) of POC-VL compared with CD4 and clinical monitoring. RESULTS: POC-VL tests with detection limits less than 1000 copies/ml increased costs due to unnecessary switches to second-line ART, without improving survival. Assuming POC-VL unit costs between US$5 and US$20 and detection limits between 1000 and 10,000 copies/ml, the ICER of POC-VL was US$4010-US$9230 compared with clinical and US$5960-US$25540 compared with CD4 cell count monitoring.

11088,Cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use in community acquired pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Although prior randomized trials have demonstrated that procalcitonin-guided antibiotic therapy effectively reduces antibiotic use in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), uncertainties remain regarding use of procalcitonin protocols in practice. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin protocols in CAP. DESIGN: Decision analysis using published observational and clinical trial data, with variation of all parameter values in sensitivity analyses. PATIENTS: Hypothetical patient cohorts who were hospitalized for CAP. INTERVENTIONS: Procalcitonin protocols vs. usual care. MAIN MEASURES: Costs and cost per quality adjusted life year gained. KEY RESULTS: When no differences in clinical outcomes were assumed, consistent with clinical trials and observational data, procalcitonin protocols cost $10-$54 more per patient than usual care in CAP patients. Under these assumptions, results were most sensitive to variations in: antibiotic cost, the likelihood that antibiotic therapy was initiated less frequently or over shorter durations, and the likelihood that physicians were nonadherent to procalcitonin protocols. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses, incorporating procalcitonin protocol-related changes in quality of life, found that protocol use was unlikely to be economically reasonable if physician protocol nonadherence was high, as observational study data suggest. However, procalcitonin protocols were favored if they decreased hospital length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: Procalcitonin protocol use in hospitalized CAP patients, although promising, lacks physician nonadherence and resource use data in routine care settings, which are needed to evaluate its potential role in patient care.",2013-01-10982,23463457,J Gen Intern Med,Kenneth J Smith,2013,28 / 9,,No,23463457,"Kenneth J Smith; Angela Wateska; M Patricia Nowalk; Mahlon Raymund; Bruce Y Lee; Richard K Zimmerman; Michael J Fine; Cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use in community acquired pneumonia, J Gen Intern Med, 2013 Sep; 28(9):1525-1497",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Week,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2011,Not Stated
11089,Cost-effectiveness analysis of on-line hemodiafiltration in Japan,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Evaluation of the socioeconomic value of medical intervention and establishment of the resources necessary for clinical practice are important for new developments in medical technology. The aim of this study was to determine the socioeconomic value of on-line hemodiafiltration (HDF). METHODS: The subjects were 24 patients who underwent hemodialysis (HD) (9 HDF, 15 HD) for chronic renal failure. A total of 288 dialysis interventions were observed for 4 weeks in three clinics. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated based on quality-adjusted life years (Qaly) and a visual analog scale. RESULTS: EuroQOL-5D (0.776 +/- 0.015) and visual analog scale (67.9 +/- 1.2) in the HDF group were higher than those in the HD group at baseline. The incremental cost utility ratio for HDF was 641.7 (JPY 10,000/Qaly) based on Qaly (0.776 +/- 0.015) and reimbursement for medical fees (JPY 4,982,736 +/- 7,852), and was lower than the incremental cost utility ratio for HD. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that on-line HDF could be cost-effective.",2013-01-10985,23466387,Blood Purif,Tomoyuki Takura,2013,35 Suppl 1 /,85-9,No,23466387,"Tomoyuki Takura; Hideki Kawanishi; Jun Minakuchi; Yoshio Nagake; Susumu Takahashi; Cost-effectiveness analysis of on-line hemodiafiltration in Japan, Blood Purif, 2013; 35 Suppl 1():1421-9735; 85-9",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,On-line hemodiafiltration vs. Hemodialysis,undergoing hemodialysis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,4 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,2666666.5,Japan,2011,38536.25
11090,The EOS 2D/3D X-ray imaging system: a cost-effectiveness analysis quantifying the health benefits from reduced radiation exposure,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the EOS((R)) 2D/3D X-ray imaging system compared with standard X-ray for the diagnosis and monitoring of orthopaedic conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to quantify the long-term costs and health outcomes, expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from the UK health service perspective. Input parameters were obtained from medical literature, previously developed cancer models and expert advice. Threshold analysis was used to quantify the additional health benefits required, over and above those associated with radiation-induced cancers, for EOS((R)) to be considered cost-effective. RESULTS: Standard X-ray is associated with a maximum health loss of 0.001 QALYs, approximately 0.4 of a day in full health, while the loss with EOS((R)) is a maximum of 0.00015 QALYs, or 0.05 of a day in full health. On a per patient basis, EOS((R)) is more expensive than standard X-ray by between pound10.66 and pound224.74 depending on the assumptions employed. The results suggest that EOS((R)) is not cost-effective for any indication. Health benefits over and above those obtained from lower radiation would need to double for EOS to be considered cost-effective. CONCLUSION: No evidence currently exists on whether there are health benefits associated with imaging improvements from the use of EOS((R)).

The health benefits from radiation dose reductions are very small. Unless EOS((R)) can generate additional health benefits as a consequence of the nature and quality of the image, comparative patient throughput with X-ray will be the major determinant of cost-effectiveness.",2013-01-10994,23473735,Eur J Radiol,Rita Faria,2013,82 / 8,e342-9,No,23473735,"Rita Faria; Claire McKenna; Ros Wade; Huiqin Yang; Nerys Woolacott; Mark Sculpher; The EOS 2D/3D X-ray imaging system: a cost-effectiveness analysis quantifying the health benefits from reduced radiation exposure, Eur J Radiol, ; 82(8):1872-7727; e342-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"EOS 2D/3D X-ray imaging system, at utilisation 30 patients per working day for 251 working days per year vs. Standard X-ray, at utilisation 30 patients per working day for 251 working days per year",Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,703218,United Kingdom,2011,1298057.93
