11501,Cost-effectiveness of febuxostat in chronic gout,"Our objective was to evaluate data on the cost-effectiveness of febuxostat compared with standard clinical practice with allopurinol in patients with gout that was presented to the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) in 2010. A Markov health-state model estimated the direct health-related costs and clinical benefits expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Adults with chronic gout and established hyperuricaemia received treatment sequences of daily doses of allopurinol 300 mg alone or allopurinol 300 mg followed by febuxostat 80 mg/120 mg. The proportion of patients achieving the target serum uric acid (sUA) level of less than 6 mg/dl (0.36 mmol/l) was linked to the utility per sUA level to generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Second-line therapy with febuxostat 80 mg/120 mg versus with allopurinol alone resulted in an ICER of pound3,578 per QALY over a 5-year time horizon. Additional univariate analyses showed that ICER values were robust and ranged from pound2,550 to pound7,165 per QALY when different parameters (e.g., low- and high-dose allopurinol titrations and variations in treatment-induced flare rates) were varied. Febuxostat reduces sUA below the European League Against Rheumatism target of 0.36 mmol/l (6 mg/dl) in significantly more patients with gout than allopurinol in its most frequently prescribed dose of 300 mg per day. The SMC accepted febuxostat as cost-effective as a suitable second-line option for urate-lowering therapy for the treatment of patients with chronic hyperuricaemia in conditions where urate deposition has already occurred (including a history or presence of tophus and/or gouty arthritis) when treatment with allopurinol was inadequate, not tolerated, or contraindicated.",2013-01-11427,23719971,Eur J Health Econ,Stephen M Beard,2014,15 / 5,,Yes,23719971,"Stephen M Beard; Birgitta G von Scheele; George Nuki; Isobel V Pearson; Cost-effectiveness of febuxostat in chronic gout, Eur J Health Econ, 2014 Jun; 15(5):1618-7598",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,First-line use of febuxostat vs. allopurinol alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,5164,United Kingdom,2011,9532.14

11505,"Active surveillance, radiofrequency ablation, or cryoablation for the nonsurgical management of a small renal mass: a cost-utility analysis","BACKGROUND: Patients with a cortical small (</=4 cm) renal mass often are not candidates for or choose not to undergo surgery. The optimal management strategy for such patients is unclear. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed from the perspective of a third party payer to compare the quality-adjusted life expectancy and lifetime costs for 67-year-old patients with a small renal mass undergoing premanagement decision biopsy, immediate percutaneous radiofrequency ablation or percutaneous cryoablation (without premanagement biopsy), or active surveillance with serial imaging and subsequent ablation if needed. RESULTS: The dominant strategy (most effective and least costly) was active surveillance with subsequent cryoablation if needed. On a quality-adjusted and discounted basis, immediate cryoablation resulted in a similar life expectancy (3 days fewer) but cost $3,010 more. This result was sensitive to the relative rate of progression to metastatic disease. Strategies that employed radiofrequency ablation had decreased quality-adjusted life expectancies (82-87 days fewer than the dominant strategy) and higher costs ($3,231-$6,398 more). CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance with delayed percutaneous cryoablation, if needed, may be a safe and cost-effective alternative to immediate cryoablation. The uncertainty in the relative long-term rate of progression to metastatic disease in patients managed with active surveillance versus immediate cryoablation needs to be weighed against the higher cost of immediate cryoablation.

11510,Cost-effectiveness of stereotactic body radiation therapy versus surgical resection for stage I non-small cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: The traditional treatment for clearly operable (CO) patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is lobectomy, with wedge resection (WR) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) serving as alternatives in marginally operable (MO) patients. Given an aging population with an increasing prevalence of screening, it is likely that progressively more people will be diagnosed with stage I NSCLC, and thus it is critical to compare the cost-effectiveness of these treatments. METHODS: A Markov model was created to compare the cost-effectiveness of SBRT with WR and lobectomy for MO and CO patients, respectively. Disease, treatment, and toxicity data were extracted from the literature and varied in sensitivity analyses. A payer (Medicare) perspective was used. RESULTS: In the base case, SBRT (MO cohort), SBRT (CO cohort), WR, and lobectomy were associated with mean cost and quality-adjusted life expectancies of $42,094/8.03, $40,107/8.21, $51,487/7.93, and $49,093/8.89, respectively. In MO patients, SBRT was the dominant and thus cost-effective strategy. This result was confirmed in most deterministic sensitivity analyses as well as probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which SBRT was most likely cost-effective up to a willingness-to-pay of more than $500,000/quality-adjusted life year. For CO patients, lobectomy was the cost-effective treatment option in the base case (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,216/quality-adjusted life year) and in nearly every sensitivity analysis.

11512,Ultrasound elastography for fibrosis surveillance is cost effective in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) is a significant risk factor for cirrhosis and subsequently hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCV patients with cirrhosis are screened for HCC every 6 months. Surveillance for progression to cirrhosis and consequently access to HCC screening is not standardized. Liver biopsy, the usual test to determine cirrhosis, carries a significant risk of morbidity and associated mortality. Transient ultrasound elastography (fibroscan) is a non-invasive test for cirrhosis. PURPOSE: This study assesses the cost effectiveness of annual surveillance for cirrhosis in patients with chronic HCV and the effect of replacing biopsy with fibroscan to diagnose cirrhosis. METHOD: A Markov decision analytic model simulated a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients with chronic HCV initially without fibrosis over their lifetime. The cirrhosis surveillance strategies assessed were: no surveillance; current practice; fibroscan in current practice with biopsy to confirm cirrhosis; fibroscan completely replacing biopsy in current practice (definitive); annual biopsy; annual fibroscan with biopsy to confirm cirrhosis; annual definitive fibroscan. RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that annual definitive fibroscan is the optimal strategy to diagnose cirrhosis. In our study, it diagnosed 20 % more cirrhosis cases than the current strategy, with 549 extra patients per 10,000 accessing screening over a lifetime and, consequently, 76 additional HCC cases diagnosed. The lifetime cost is pound98.78 extra per patient compared to the current strategy for 1.72 additional unadjusted life years. Annual fibroscan surveillance of 132 patients results in the diagnosis one additional HCC case over a lifetime. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for an annual definitive fibroscan is pound6,557.06/quality-adjusted life years gained. CONCLUSION: Annual definitive fibroscan may be a cost-effective surveillance strategy to identify cirrhosis in patients with chronic HCV, thereby allowing access of these patients to HCC screening.",2013-01-11430,23720196,Dig Dis Sci,C Canavan,2013,58 / 9,,No,23720196,"C Canavan; J Eisenburg; L Meng; K Corey; C Hur; Ultrasound elastography for fibrosis surveillance is cost effective in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus in the UK, Dig Dis Sci, 2013 Sep; 58(9):0163-2116",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Annual definitive fibroscan investifation for development of cirrhosis, followed by HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) screening at 6-month intervals vs. Symptomatic investigation and treatment only",Without fibrosis,35 Years,34 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,6557.06,United Kingdom,2012,11717.89

In our study, it diagnosed 20 % more cirrhosis cases than the current strategy, with 549 extra patients per 10,000 accessing screening over a lifetime and, consequently, 76 additional HCC cases diagnosed. The lifetime cost is pound98.78 extra per patient compared to the current strategy for 1.72 additional unadjusted life years. Annual fibroscan surveillance of 132 patients results in the diagnosis one additional HCC case over a lifetime. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for an annual definitive fibroscan is pound6,557.06/quality-adjusted life years gained. CONCLUSION: Annual definitive fibroscan may be a cost-effective surveillance strategy to identify cirrhosis in patients with chronic HCV, thereby allowing access of these patients to HCC screening.",2013-01-11430,23720196,Dig Dis Sci,C Canavan,2013,58 / 9,,No,23720196,"C Canavan; J Eisenburg; L Meng; K Corey; C Hur; Ultrasound elastography for fibrosis surveillance is cost effective in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus in the UK, Dig Dis Sci, 2013 Sep; 58(9):0163-2116",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Current surveillance strategy (intermittent biopsy of patients to monitor firbosis stage, followed by USS (ultrasound scanning) and AFP (serum alpha-fetoprotein) screening at 6-month intervals once cirrhosis has been diagnosed. vs. Symptomatic investigation and treatment only",Without fibrosis,35 Years,34 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,18013.21,United Kingdom,2012,32190.77
11514,Cost-utility analysis of the EVOLVO study on remote monitoring for heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators: randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators place a significant burden on health care systems. Remote monitoring allows assessment of device function and heart failure parameters, and may represent a safe, effective, and cost-saving method compared to conventional in-office follow-up. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that remote device monitoring represents a cost-effective approach. This paper summarizes the economic evaluation of the Evolution of Management Strategies of Heart Failure Patients With Implantable Defibrillators (EVOLVO) study, a multicenter clinical trial aimed at measuring the benefits of remote monitoring for heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators. METHODS: Two hundred patients implanted with a wireless transmission-enabled implantable defibrillator were randomized to receive either remote monitoring or the conventional method of in-person evaluations. Patients were followed for 16 months with a protocol of scheduled in-office and remote follow-ups. The economic evaluation of the intervention was conducted from the perspectives of the health care system and the patient. A cost-utility analysis was performed to measure whether the intervention was cost-effective in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Overall, remote monitoring did not show significant annual cost savings for the health care system (euro1962.78 versus euro2130.01; P=.80). There was a significant reduction of the annual cost for the patients in the remote arm in comparison to the standard arm (euro291.36 versus euro381.34; P=.01). Cost-utility analysis was performed for 180 patients for whom QALYs were available. The patients in the remote arm gained 0.065 QALYs more than those in the standard arm over 16 months, with a cost savings of euro888.10 per patient. Results from the cost-utility analysis of the EVOLVO study show that remote monitoring is a cost-effective and dominant solution. CONCLUSIONS: Remote management of heart failure patients with implantable defibrillators appears to be cost-effective compared to the conventional method of in-person evaluations.

11515,Risk assessment to guide prostate cancer screening decisions: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To apply the most recent evidence from randomised trials of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and explore the potential value of risk assessments to guide the use of PSA screening in practice. DESIGN: A decision model that incorporated a Markov process was developed in 2012 to estimate the net benefit and cost of PSA screening versus no screening as a function of baseline risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-2013s (QALYs) and costs. RESULTS: The harms of screening outweighed the benefits under a number of plausible scenarios. Conclusions were sensitive to the estimated quality-of-life impacts of prostate cancer treatment as well as the incidence of cancers not detected by screening tests (poorer prognosis) and those that were detected by screening tests (better prognosis). The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PSA screening was $168,611 per QALY for men with average risk, $73,452 per QALY for men with two times the average risk, and $22,938 [corrected] per QALY for men with five times the average risk. CONCLUSIONS: PSA screening was not found to be cost-effective for men at an average-to-high risk of prostate cancer, but may be cost-effective for men at very high risk.

11518,Cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone to heroin users for lay overdose reversal in Russian cities,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone to illicit opioid users for lay overdose reversal in Russian cities. METHOD: This study adapted an integrated Markov and decision analytic model to Russian cities. The model took a lifetime, societal perspective, relied on published literature, and was calibrated to epidemiologic findings. RESULTS: For each 20% of heroin users reached with naloxone distribution, the model predicted a 13.4% reduction in overdose deaths in the first 5 years and 7.6% over a lifetime; on probabilistic analysis, one death would be prevented for every 89 naloxone kits distributed (95% CI = 32-260). Naloxone distribution was cost-effective in all deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and cost-saving if resulting in a reduction in overdose events. Naloxone distribution increased costs by US$13 (95% CI = US$3-US$32) and QALYs by 0.137 (95% CI = 0.022-0.389) for an incremental cost of US$94 per QALY gained (95% CI = US$40-US$325). In a worst-case scenario where overdose was rarely witnessed and naloxone was rarely used, minimally effective, and expensive, the incremental cost was US$1987 per QALY gained. If national expenditures on drug-related HIV, tuberculosis, and criminal justice were applied to heroin users, the incremental cost was US$928 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Naloxone distribution to heroin users for lay overdose reversal is highly likely to reduce overdose deaths in target communities and is robustly cost-effective, even within the constraints of this conservative model.",2013-01-11443,23730942,J Med Econ,Phillip O Coffin,2013,16 / 8,1051-60,Yes,23730942,"Phillip O Coffin; Sean D Sullivan; Cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone to heroin users for lay overdose reversal in Russian cities, J Med Econ, ; 16(8):1369-6998; 1051-60",QALY,Russia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Distribution of naloxone for lay overdose reversal vs. None,Heroin users,38 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,94,United States,2010,111.57
11519,Pregabalin versus gabapentin in the management of peripheral neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy: a cost effectiveness analysis for the Greek healthcare setting,"BACKGROUND: The anticonvulsants pregabalin and gabapentin are both indicated for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain. The decision on which treatment provides the best alternative, should take into account all aspects of costs and outcomes associated with the two therapeutic options. The objective of this study was to examine the cost - effectiveness of the two agents in the management of patients with painful diabetic neuropathy or post - herpetic neuralgia, under the third party payer perspective in Greece. METHODS: The analysis was based on a dynamic simulation model which estimated and compared the costs and outcomes of pregabalin and gabapentin in a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients suffering from painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN) or Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN). In the model, each patient was randomly allocated an average pretreatment pain score, measured using an eleven-point visual analogue scale (0 - 10) and was ""run through"" the model, simulating their daily pain intensity and allowing for stochastic calculation of outcomes, taking into account medical interventions and the effectiveness of each treatment. RESULTS: Pregabalin demonstrated a reduction in days with moderate to severe pain when compared to gabapentin. During the 12 weeks the pregabalin arm demonstrated a 0.1178 (SE 0.0002) QALY gain, which proved to be 0.0063 (SE 0.0003) higher than that in the gabapentin arm. The mean medication cost per patient was higher for the pregabalin arm when compared to the gabapentin arm (i.e. euro134.40) over the 12 week treatment period. However, this higher cost was partially offset by the reduced direct medical costs (i.e. the cost of specialist visits, the cost of diagnostic tests and the other applied interventions). Comparing costs with respective outcomes, the ICERs for pregabalin versus gabapentin were euro13 (95%CI: 8 - 18) per additional day with no or mild pain and euro19,320 (95%CI: 11,743 - 26,755) per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathic pain carries a great disease burden for patients and society and, is also, associated with a significant economic burden. The treatment of pain associated with DPN and PHN with pregabalin is a cost-effective intervention for the social security in Greece compared to gabapentin. Thus, these findings need to be taken into consideration in the decision - making process when considering which therapy to use for the treatment of neuropathic pain.",2013-01-11446,23731598,BMC Neurol,Kostas Athanasakis,2013,13 /,56,No,23731598,"Kostas Athanasakis; Ioannis Petrakis; Eleftheria Karampli; Elli Vitsou; Leonidas Lyras; John Kyriopoulos; Pregabalin versus gabapentin in the management of peripheral neuropathic pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy: a cost effectiveness analysis for the Greek healthcare setting, BMC Neurol, ; 13():1471-2377; 56",QALY,Greece,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Pregabalin plus outpatient care daily dose of 150 - 600 mg vs. Gabapentin, plus out patient care, mean deaily dose of 2400 mg",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,19320,Euro,2011,30933.75

RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed that SLN procedure followed by ND or WW was the most effective and most cost effective strategy. Compared with direct END the incremental cost effectiveness ratio was euro3356 per QALY gained. Uncertainty analysis showed that the model was sensitive to changes in assumed occult metastases incidence and utility values. SLN was found to have the highest probability (66%) of being cost-effective of the five strategies, at a willingness to pay of euro80,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current evidence and costs the SLN procedure followed by ND or WW appears to be the most cost effective strategy for diagnosing and treating oral squamous cell cancer patients.

11528,Cost-effectiveness of hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic versus standard laparoscopic donor nephrectomy: a randomized study,"BACKGROUND: Live kidney donation has a clear economical benefit over dialysis and deceased-donor transplantation. Compared with mini-incision open donor nephrectomy, laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN) is considered cost-effective. However, little is known on the cost-effectiveness of hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy (HARP). This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HARP versus LDN. METHODS: Alongside a randomized controlled trial, the cost-effectiveness of HARP versus LDN was assessed. Eighty-six donors were included in the LDN group and 82 in the HARP group. All in-hospital costs were recorded. During follow-up, return-to-work and other societal costs were documented up to 1 year. The EuroQol-5D questionnaire was administered up to 1 year postoperatively to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Mean total costs from a healthcare perspective were $8935 for HARP and $8650 for LDN (P = 0.25). Mean total costs from a societal perspective were $16,357 for HARP and $16,286 for LDN (P = 0.79). On average, donors completely resumed their daytime jobs on day 54 in the HARP group and on day 52 in the LDN group (P = 0.65). LDN resulted in a gain of 0.005 QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: Absolute costs of both procedures are very low and the differences in costs and QALYs between LDN and HARP are very small. Other arguments, such as donor safety and pain, should determine the choice between HARP and LDN.",2013-01-11453,23736351,Transplantation,Karel W J Klop,2013,96 / 2,170-5,No,23736351,"Karel W J Klop; Niels F M Kok; Leonienke F C Dols; Frank C d'Ancona; Eddy M M Adang; Janneke P C Grutters; Jan N M Ijzermans; Cost-effectiveness of hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic versus standard laparoscopic donor nephrectomy: a randomized study, Transplantation, ; 96(2):0041-1337; 170-5",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic donor nephrectomy vs. laparoscopic donor nephrectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1440,United States,2011,-1656.84
11529,"Meningococcal serogroup A, C, W(1)(3)(5) and Y conjugated vaccine: a cost-effectiveness analysis in the Netherlands","BACKGROUND: In 2002, vaccination with a serogroup C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenC) was introduced in the Netherlands for all children aged 14 months. Despite its success, herd immunity may wane over time. Recently, a serogroup A,C,W135,Y meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) was licensed for use in subjects of 12 months of age and above. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of meningococcal vaccination at 14 months and an additional vaccination at the age of 12 years, both with the MenACWY vaccine. METHODS: A decision analysis cohort model, with 185,000 Dutch newborns, was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different immunization strategies. For strategies including a vaccination at 12 years of age, an additional cohort with adolescents aged 12 years was followed. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated for the current disease incidence and for a scenario when herd immunity is lost. RESULTS: Vaccination with MenACWY at 14 months is cost-saving. Vaccinating with MenACWY at 14 months and at 12 years would prevent 7 additional cases of meningococcal serogroup A,C,W135,Y disease in the birth cohort and adolescent cohort followed for 99 years compared to the current vaccine schedule of a single vaccination with MenC at 14 months. With the current incidence, this strategy resulted in an ICER of euro635,334 per quality adjusted life year. When serogroup C disease incidence returns to pre-vaccination levels due to a loss of vaccine-induced herd-immunity, vaccination with MenACWY at 14 months and at 12 years would be cost-saving. CONCLUSIONS: Routine vaccination with MenACWY is cost-saving. With the current epidemiology, a booster-dose with MenACWY is not likely cost-effective.

MATERIALS & METHODS: Using a decision-analytic Markov model, cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenetic-guided therapy versus standard care was estimated. RESULTS: Compared with standard care, the pharmacogenetic-guided dosing strategy increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) only very slightly and increased costs by euro15. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro2658 per QALY gained. In sensitivity analyses, the cost of genotyping had the largest influence on the cost-effectiveness ratio. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the incremental costs of genotype-guided dosing were less than euro20,000 per QALY gained in 75.6% of the simulations. CONCLUSION: Pharmacogenetic-guided dosing of phenprocoumon has the potential to increase health slightly and may be able to achieve this in a cost-effective way.

11535,Using patient-reported outcome measures to estimate cost-effectiveness of hip replacements in English hospitals,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the average cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from hip surgery, and to examine the variation in that between hospitals. DESIGN: The transformation of patient-reported outcome measures (EQ-5D data) into QALYs, covering 25,463 NHS patient episodes between April 2009 and August 2010 from hospitals in England, using a model of future health change arising from a hip operation compared to a counterfactual of no operation. Hospital-level costs for hip procedures from the National Reference Costs data-set was used to calculate the hospitals'' cost per QALY. SETTING: English hospitals treating NHS-funded patients undergoing hip replacement. PARTICIPANTS: NHS-funded patients undergoing primary hip replacement. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost per QALY. RESULTS: Assuming some degradation in patients'' health over the lifetime of the hip prosthesis, average health gain arising from a hip operation was 2.77 QALYs. For procedures paid for by the NHS but carried out in the independent sector the average gain was 2.97 QALYs. Average NHS hospital hip procedure costs were estimated to be pound5844. The unweighted average cost per QALY for NHS hospitals was pound2128. There were significant variations in cost per QALY between hospitals; most of this variation appears to be driven by variations in cost, not QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: Using the new patient-assessed health-related quality of life data combined with routine hospital-level cost data it is possible to estimate a procedure-based measure of efficiency for hospitals.

DESIGN: Cost-utility model populated with national PROMs, National Reference Cost and Hospital Episodes Statistics data. SETTING: Hospitals in England that provided elective inguinal hernia repair surgery for NHS patients between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2010. PARTICIPANTS: Patients >18 years undergoing NHS-funded elective hernia surgery in English hospitals who completed PROMs questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Change in quality-adjusted life year (QALY) following surgery; cost per QALY of surgery by acute provider hospital; health gain and cost per QALY by surgery type received (laparoscopic or open hernia repair). RESULTS: The casemix-adjusted, discounted (at 3.5%) and degraded (over 25 years) mean change in QALYs following elective hernia repair surgery is 0.826 (95% CI, 0.793-0.859) compared to a counterfactual of no treatment. Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery show a significantly greater gain in health-related quality of life (EQ-5D index change, 0.0915; 95% CI, 0.0850-0.0979) with an estimated gain of 0.923 QALYS (95% CI, 0.859-0.988) compared to those having open repair (EQ-5D index change, 0.0806; 95% CI, 0.0771-0.0841) at 0.817 QALYS (95% CI, 0.782-0.852). The average cost of hernia surgery in England is pound1554, representing a mean cost per QALY of pound1881. The mean cost of laparoscopic and open hernia surgery is equivocal ( pound1421 vs. pound1426 respectively) but laparoscopies appear to offer higher cost-utility at pound1540 per QALY, compared to pound1746 per QALY for open surgery.

Patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery show a significantly greater gain in health-related quality of life (EQ-5D index change, 0.0915; 95% CI, 0.0850-0.0979) with an estimated gain of 0.923 QALYS (95% CI, 0.859-0.988) compared to those having open repair (EQ-5D index change, 0.0806; 95% CI, 0.0771-0.0841) at 0.817 QALYS (95% CI, 0.782-0.852). The average cost of hernia surgery in England is pound1554, representing a mean cost per QALY of pound1881. The mean cost of laparoscopic and open hernia surgery is equivocal ( pound1421 vs. pound1426 respectively) but laparoscopies appear to offer higher cost-utility at pound1540 per QALY, compared to pound1746 per QALY for open surgery.

11539,Cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices,"OBJECTIVES: Mechanical circulatory support through left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) improves survival and quality of life for patients with end-stage heart failure who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation. Our aim was to calculate the cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow LVADs. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective was performed. A lifetime Markov model was set up in which continuous-flow LVAD was compared with optimal medical therapy (OMT). The treatment effect was modeled indirectly combining the results of the REMATCH trial comparing OMT with a pulsatile-flow LVAD and the HeartMate II Destination Therapy Trial comparing a pulsatile-flow LVAD with a continuous-flow LVAD. Cost data were based on real-world financial data of sixty-nine patients with a HeartMate II implantation from the University Medical Centre Utrecht (the Netherlands). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Comparing the continuous-flow HeartMate II with OMT, 3.23 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 2.18-4.49) life-years were gained (LYG) or 2.83 (95 percent CI, 1.91-3.90) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost of an LVAD implant was approximately euro126,000, of which the device itself represented the largest cost, being euro70,000. Total incremental costs amounted to euro299,100 (95 percent CI, 190,500-521,000). This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro94,100 (95 percent CI, 59,100-160,100) per LYG or euro107,600 (95 percent CI, 66,700-181,100) per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed these results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Although LVAD destination therapy improves survival and quality of life, it remains a relatively expensive intervention which renders the reimbursement of this therapy questionable.",2013-01-11493,23763844,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Mattias Neyt,2013,29 / 3,254-60,No,23763844,"Mattias Neyt; Ann Van den Bruel; Yolba Smit; Nicolaas De Jonge; Michiel Erasmus; Diederik van Dijk; Joan Vlayen; Cost-effectiveness of continuous-flow left ventricular assist devices, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, ; 29(3):0266-4623; 254-60",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation vs. Optimal medical therapy (OMT),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,107600,Euro,2011,172281.15
11540,Cost-effectiveness of a stepped care programme to prevent depression and anxiety in residents in homes for the older people: a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are common in residents of elderly homes. Both disorders have negative effects on functioning, well-being and health-care utilisation. Besides treatment, prevention can be an option to reduce the burden of mental disorders. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a stepped care programme to prevent the onset of depression and anxiety disorders in residents of elderly homes compared with usual care from a societal perspective. METHODS: Outcomes were incidence of depression and/or anxiety, severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms and quality-adjusted life years. Health-care utilisation was measured during interviews. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing cost and effect data. Uncertainty around cost differences and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was estimated using bootstrapping. Cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves were created. RESULTS: The incidence of depression and anxiety combined in the intervention group was not reduced in comparison with the usual care group. There was also no effect on the other outcomes. Mean total costs in the intervention group were euro838 higher than in the usual care group, but this difference was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval, -593 to 2420). Cost-effectiveness planes showed that there was considerable uncertainty. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the maximum probability of the intervention being cost-effective in comparison with usual care was 0.46 for reducing the incidence of depression and anxiety combined. CONCLUSION: A stepped care programme to prevent depression and anxiety in older people living in elderly homes was not considered cost-effective in comparison with usual care.",2013-01-11495,23765874,Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,J E Bosmans,2014,29 / 2,,No,23765874,"J E Bosmans; E Dozeman; Harm W J van Marwijk; Digna J F van Schaik; Max L Stek; Aartjan T F Beekman; Henriette E van der Horst; Cost-effectiveness of a stepped care programme to prevent depression and anxiety in residents in homes for the older people: a randomised controlled trial, Int J Geriatr Psychiatry, 2014 Feb; 29(2):0885-6230",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Stepped care program to prevent the onset of depression and anxiety disorders in residents of elderly homes vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,26890,Euro,2008,47598.85
11541,The cost-utility of haemodiafiltration versus haemodialysis in the Convective Transport Study,"BACKGROUND: Despite the growing interest in haemodiafiltration (HDF), there is no information on the costs and cost-utility of this dialysis modality yet. It was therefore our objective to study the cost-utility of HDF versus haemodialysis (HD). METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a Markov model. It included data from the Convective Transport Study (CONTRAST), a randomized controlled trial that compared online HDF with low-flux HD. Costs were estimated using a societal perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to study uncertainty. RESULTS: Total annual costs for HDF and HD were euro88 622+/-19,272 and euro86,086+/-15,945, respectively (in 2009 euros). When modelled over a 5-year period, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of HDF versus HD was euro287,679. Sensitivity analyses revealed that this amount will not fall below euro140,000, even under the most favourable assumptions like a high-convection volume (>20.3 L). CONCLUSIONS: Based on accepted societal willingness-to-pay thresholds, HDF cannot be considered a cost-effective treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease at present.

11542,New anticoagulants as thromboprophylaxis after total hip or knee replacement,"OBJECTIVES: Due to a high risk of thromboembolism in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, it has become standard practice to give thromboprophylactic treatment. We assessed the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of two new oral anticoagulants, rivaroxaban and dabigatran, relative to subcutaneous enoxaparin for the prevention of thromboembolism after total hip replacement (THR) and total knee replacement surgery (TKR). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to assess efficacy and safety, and evaluated quality of documentation using GRADE. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by developing a decision model. The model combined two modules; a decision tree for the short-term prophylaxis and a Markov model for the long-term complications and survival gain. RESULTS: For rivaroxaban compared with enoxaparin, we found statistically significant decreases in deep vein thrombosis, but also a trend toward increased risk of major bleeding. For mortality and pulmonary embolism there were no statistically significant differences between the treatments. We did not find statistically significant differences between dabigatran and enoxaparin for our efficacy and safety outcomes. Assuming a willingness to pay of EUR62,500 per QALY, rivaroxaban following THR had a probability of 38 percent, and enoxaparin following TKR had a probability of 34 percent of being cost-effective. Clinical efficacy had the greatest impact on decision uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Dabigatran and rivaroxaban are comparable with enoxaparin following THR and TKR regarding the efficacy and safety outcomes.

11546,Cost-effectiveness of early palliative care intervention in recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if early palliative care intervention in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is potentially cost saving or cost-effective. METHODS: A decision model with a 6 month time horizon evaluated routine care versus routine care plus early referral to a palliative medicine specialist (EPC) for recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. Model parameters included rates of inpatient admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, chemotherapy administration, and quality of life (QOL). From published ovarian cancer data, we assumed baseline rates over the final 6 months: hospitalization 70%, chemotherapy 60%, and ED visit 30%. Published data from a randomized trial evaluating EPC in metastatic lung cancer were used to model odds ratios (ORs) for potential reductions in hospitalization (OR 0.69), chemotherapy (OR 0.77), and emergency department care (OR 0.74) and improvement in QOL (OR 1.07). The costs of hospitalization, ED visit, chemotherapy, and EPC were based on published data. Ranges were used for sensitivity analysis. Effectiveness was quantified in quality adjusted life years (QALYs); survival was assumed equivalent between strategies. RESULTS: EPC was associated with a cost savings of $1285 per patient over routine care. In sensitivity analysis incorporating QOL, EPC was either dominant or cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) <$50,000/QALY, unless the cost of outpatient EPC exceeded $2400. Assuming no clinical benefit other than QOL (no change in chemotherapy administration, hospitalizations or ED visits), EPC remained highly cost-effective with ICER $37,440/QALY.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov-chain decision model was created to simulate treatment of SUI with TVT or BC using Treeage Pro 2011 software (Treeage Software Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA). Costing data were obtained from the Medicare Resource-Based Relative Value Scale. Data regarding the success of TVT vs BC were obtained from the peer-reviewed literature, as were corresponding utilities for different continence states. The CE of each procedure was calculated and compared, and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: At 10-year follow-up, TVT was more cost-effective (CE = $1495/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]) than BC (CE = $1824/QALY). Sensitivity analysis showed that TVT was more cost-effective than BC if the cost of the TVT device was <$3220. If the probability of success after TVT was <42%, then BC became the more cost-effective strategy (CE = $1827/QALY).

The longer-term cost-effectiveness is, however, uncertain. This study evaluated the long-term health benefits, costs and cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic fundoplication compared with continued medical management in patients with GORD. METHODS: Individual patient data were used from the 5-year follow-up of the REFLUX trial, a large multicentre, pragmatic, randomized trial in which 357 patients with GORD for at least 12 months at trial entry were allocated randomly to early laparoscopic fundoplication or continued medical management. Health outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A UK National Health Service perspective was used for costs. RESULTS: The group randomized to surgery experienced better health outcomes in each year of follow-up, but the difference narrowed over time. At 5 years, the surgery group had experienced 0.216 (95 per cent confidence interval 0.021 to 0.412) more QALYs but also accrued euro1832 (1214 to 2448) more costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro8481 per QALY gained. The probability that surgery is the most cost-effective intervention was 0.932 at a threshold of euro24,134/QALY ( pound20,000/QALY). Results were robust to most sensitivity analyses, except where patients with missing data randomized to surgery were assumed to have worse health outcomes.

11549,Cost-effectiveness of full coverage of aromatase inhibitors for Medicare beneficiaries with early breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Rates of nonadherence to aromatase inhibitors (AIs) among Medicare beneficiaries with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer are high. Out-of-pocket drug costs appear to be an important contributor to this and may be addressed by eliminating copayments and other forms of patient cost sharing. The authors estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing Medicare beneficiaries with full prescription coverage for AIs compared with usual prescription coverage under the Medicare Part D program. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to simulate AI use and disease progression in a hypothetical cohort of postmenopausal Medicare beneficiaries with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. The analysis was conducted from the societal perspective and considered a lifetime horizon. The main outcome was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which was measured as the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: For patients receiving usual prescription coverage, average quality-adjusted survival was 11.35 QALYs, and lifetime costs were $83,002. For patients receiving full prescription coverage, average quality-adjusted survival was 11.38 QALYs, and lifetime costs were $82,728.

11550,Cost-effectiveness of full coverage of aromatase inhibitors for Medicare beneficiaries with early breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Rates of nonadherence to aromatase inhibitors (AIs) among Medicare beneficiaries with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer are high. Out-of-pocket drug costs appear to be an important contributor to this and may be addressed by eliminating copayments and other forms of patient cost sharing. The authors estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing Medicare beneficiaries with full prescription coverage for AIs compared with usual prescription coverage under the Medicare Part D program. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to simulate AI use and disease progression in a hypothetical cohort of postmenopausal Medicare beneficiaries with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. The analysis was conducted from the societal perspective and considered a lifetime horizon. The main outcome was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which was measured as the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: For patients receiving usual prescription coverage, average quality-adjusted survival was 11.35 QALYs, and lifetime costs were $83,002. For patients receiving full prescription coverage, average quality-adjusted survival was 11.38 QALYs, and lifetime costs were $82,728.

11551,"Assessing the potential cost-effectiveness of retesting IHC0, IHC1+, or FISH-negative early stage breast cancer patients for HER2 status","BACKGROUND: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) tests are commonly used to assess human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) status of tumors in patients with breast cancer. This analysis evaluates the likely cost-effectiveness of expanded retesting to assess HER2 tumor status in women with early stage breast cancer. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of expanded reflex testing from a US payer perspective. Expanded reflex testing is defined as retesting tumor specimens from patients whose tumors are IHC0, IHC1+, or FISH-negative on their first test. In the base case, we assumed that 80% of patient tumors are initially IHC-tested and 20% are FISH-tested. Testing outcomes for IHC and FISH with and without retesting were based on published meta-analyses. The cost of tests and treatment and the long-term health outcomes were obtained from the literature. RESULTS: In the base case, we estimated that 2.27% of women who received expanded reflex testing would be HER2-positive and receive trastuzumab treatment: the projected ICER was $36,721 per life year or $39,745 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). This varied between $47,100 per QALY and $35,500 per QALY if we assumed that 1%-8% of patients retested were then HER2+, respectively. The results of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were robust. This strategy would result in 4700 (2000-17,000) patients being eligible to receive trastuzumab treatment annually.

11552,Incremental cost-effectiveness evaluation of vaccinating girls against cervical cancer pre- and post-sexual debut in Belgium,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) to prevent cervical cancer (CC) primarily targets young girls before sexual debut and is cost-effective. We assessed whether vaccination with the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine added to screening remains cost-effective in females after sexual debut compared to screening alone in Belgium. The role of protection against non-HPV-16/18 was also investigated. METHODS: A published Markov cohort model was adapted to Belgium. The model replicated the natural history of HPV infection, the effects of screening, and vaccination. Vaccine efficacy (VE) included non-HPV-16/18 protection based on the PATRICIA clinical trial data. Pre- and post-HPV exposure VE were differentiated. Lifetime vaccine protection was assumed. Input data were obtained from literature review, national databases and a Delphi panel. Costing was from a healthcare payer perspective. Costs were discounted at 3% and effects at 1.5%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and the number of lesions prevented with vaccination from age 12 to 40 was evaluated. The specific effect of non-HPV-16/18 protection was investigated. Univariate sensitivity analysis was performed on key variables. RESULTS: The model estimated that vaccinating a cohort of 100,000 girls at age 12 would prevent 646 CC cases over a lifetime (102 non-HPV-16/18) with an ICER of euro9171/QALY. Vaccinating at age 26 would prevent 340 CC cases (40 non-HPV-16/18) with an ICER of euro17,348/QALY and vaccinating at age 40 would prevent 146 CC cases (17 non-HPV-16/18) with an ICER of euro42,847/QALY. The ICER remained under the highly cost-effective threshold (1xGDP/capita) until age 33 years and under the cost-effective threshold (3xGDP/capita) beyond age 40.

11554,Cost-effectiveness of an advance notification letter to increase colorectal cancer screening,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a patient-direct mailed advance notification letter on participants of a National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) in Australia, which was launched in August 2006 and offers free fecal occult blood testing to all Australians turning 50, 55, or 65 years of age in any given year. METHODS: This study followed a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old, 55-year-old, and 65-year-old patients undergoing fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening through a decision analytic Markov model. The intervention compared two strategies: (i) advance letter, NBCSP, and FOBT compared with (ii) NBCSP and FOBT. The main outcome measures were life-years gained (LYG), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: An advance notification screening letter would yield an additional 54 per 100,000 colorectal cancer deaths avoided compared with no letter. The estimated cost-effectiveness was $3,976 per LYG and $6,976 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: An advance notification letter in the NBCSP may have a significant impact on LYG and cancer deaths avoided.

11555,"Observation versus initial treatment for men with localized, low-risk prostate cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis","BACKGROUND: Observation is underutilized among men with localized, low-risk prostate cancer. OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs and benefits of observation versus initial treatment. DESIGN: Decision analysis simulating treatment or observation. DATA SOURCES: Medicare schedules, published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Men aged 65 and 75 years who had newly diagnosed low-risk prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen level <10 microg/L, stage </=T2a, Gleason score </=3 + 3). TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Treatment (brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or radical prostatectomy) or observation (active surveillance [AS] or watchful waiting [WW]). OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Observation was more effective and less costly than initial treatment. Compared with AS, WW provided 2 additional months of quality-adjusted life expectancy (9.02 vs. 8.85 years) at a savings of $15,374 ($24,520 vs. $39,894) in men aged 65 years and 2 additional months (6.14 vs. 5.98 years) at a savings of $11,746 ($18,302 vs. $30,048) in men aged 75 years. Brachytherapy was the most effective and least expensive initial treatment. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Treatment became more effective than observation when it led to more dramatic reductions in prostate cancer death (hazard ratio, 0.47 vs. WW and 0.64 vs. AS). Active surveillance became as effective as WW in men aged 65 years when the probability of progressing to treatment on AS decreased below 63% or when the quality of life with AS versus WW was 4% higher in men aged 65 years or 1% higher in men aged 75 years. Watchful waiting remained least expensive in all analyses. LIMITATION: Results depend on outcomes reported in the published literature, which is limited.

Compared with AS, WW provided 2 additional months of quality-adjusted life expectancy (9.02 vs. 8.85 years) at a savings of $15,374 ($24,520 vs. $39,894) in men aged 65 years and 2 additional months (6.14 vs. 5.98 years) at a savings of $11,746 ($18,302 vs. $30,048) in men aged 75 years. Brachytherapy was the most effective and least expensive initial treatment. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Treatment became more effective than observation when it led to more dramatic reductions in prostate cancer death (hazard ratio, 0.47 vs. WW and 0.64 vs. AS). Active surveillance became as effective as WW in men aged 65 years when the probability of progressing to treatment on AS decreased below 63% or when the quality of life with AS versus WW was 4% higher in men aged 65 years or 1% higher in men aged 75 years. Watchful waiting remained least expensive in all analyses. LIMITATION: Results depend on outcomes reported in the published literature, which is limited. CONCLUSION: Among these men, observation is more effective and costs less than initial treatment, and WW is most effective and least expensive under a wide range of clinical scenarios.

11562,Cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of acute ischemic stroke: experience from Australian stroke center,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous economic studies outside Australia have demonstrated that patients treated with tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) within 4.5 hours of stroke onset have lower healthcare costs than those not. We aim to perform cost-effectiveness analysis of intravenous tPA in an Australian setting. METHODS: Data on clinical outcomes and costs were derived for 378 patients who received intravenous tPA within 4.5 hours of stroke onset at Royal Melbourne Hospital (Australia) between January 2003 and December 2011. To simulate clinical outcomes and costs for a hypothetical control group assumed not to have received tPA, we applied efficacy data from a meta-analysis of randomized trials to outcomes observed in the tPA group. During a 1-year time-horizon, net costs, years of life lived, and quality-adjusted life-years were compared and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios derived for tPA versus no tPA. RESULTS: In the study population, mean (SD) age was 68.2 (13.5) years and 206 (54.5%) were men. Median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (interquartile range) at presentation was 12.5 (8-18). Compared with no tPA, we estimated that tPA would result in 0.02 life-years and 0.04 quality-adjusted life-years saved per person>1 year. The net cost of tPA was AUD $55.61 per patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were AUD $2377 per life-year saved and AUD $1478 per quality-adjusted life-years saved. Because the costs of tPA are incurred only once, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios would decrease with increasing time-horizon. Uncertainty analyses indicated the results to be robust.

11563,Cost-effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in preventing stroke and other cardiovascular events in patients with atrial fibrillation,"OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Secondary objectives related to assessing the cost-effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants stratified by center-specific time in therapeutic range, age, and CHADS2 score. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was assessed by the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Analysis used a Markov cohort model that followed patients from initiation of pharmacotherapy to death. Transition probabilities were obtained from a concurrent network meta-analysis. Utility values and costs were obtained from published data. Numerous deterministic sensitivity analyses and probabilistic analysis were conducted. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained for dabigatran 150 mg versus warfarin was $20,797. Apixaban produced equal QALYs at a higher cost. Dabigatran 110 mg and rivaroxaban were dominated by dabigatran 150 mg and apixaban. Results were sensitive to the drug costs of apixaban, the time horizon adopted, and the consequences from major and minor bleeds with dabigatran. Results varied by a center''s average time in therapeutic range, a patient''s CHADS2 score, and patient age, with either dabigatran 150 mg or apixaban being optimal. CONCLUSIONS: Results were highly sensitive to patient characteristics. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran 110 mg were unlikely to be cost-effective.

11568,Cost-effectiveness of trabectedin plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin for the treatment of women with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer in the UK: analysis based on the final survival data of the OVA-301 trial,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of trabectedin plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) compared with PLD alone for the treatment of patients with relapsed platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who are not expected to benefit from retreatment with platinum-based therapies based on the final survival data published in October 2012. METHODS: A decision-analytic model estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for trabectedin plus PLD compared with PLD alone from the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective over a lifetime horizon. Mean progression-free survival and overall survival were calculated by using parametric survival distributions adjusted for imbalances discovered in the final survival data. Between-arm imbalances included the platinum-free interval, cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score. Cost categories included drug, administration, medical management, and treatment of adverse events. Quality of life was measured by using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Uncertainty was addressed by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, trabectedin plus PLD increased mean progression-free survival by 3.0 months and overall survival by 9.7 months compared with PLD alone. The additional cost and QALYs of trabectedin plus PLD were pound18,476 and 0.49, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound38,026 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed that results were sensitive to platinum-free interval adjustment and the choice of survival distributions.

11569,Cost-effectiveness of early assisted discharge for COPD exacerbations in The Netherlands,"OBJECTIVES: Hospital admissions for exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are the main cost drivers of the disease. An alternative is to treat suitable patients at home instead of in the hospital. This article reports on the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of early assisted discharge in The Netherlands. METHODS: In the multicenter randomized controlled Assessment of GOing Home under Early Assisted Discharge trial (n = 139), one group received 7 days of inpatient hospital treatment (HOSP) and one group was discharged after 3 days and treated at home by community nurses for 4 days. Health care resource use, productivity losses, and informal care were recorded in cost questionnaires. Microcosting was performed for inpatient day costs. RESULTS: Seven days after admission, mean change from baseline Clinical Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Questionnaire score was better for HOSP, but not statistically significantly: 0.29 (95% confidence interval [CI]-0.04 to 0.61). The difference in the probability of having a clinically relevant improvement was significant in favor of HOSP: 19.0%-point (95% CI 0.5%-36.3%). After 3 months of follow-up, differences in effectiveness had almost disappeared. The difference in quality-adjusted life-years was 0.0054 (95% CI-0.021 to 0.0095). From a health care perspective, early assisted discharge was cost saving:-euro244 (treatment phase, 95% CI-euro315 to-euro168) and-euro168 (3 months, 95% CI-euro1253 to euro922). Societal perspective:-euro65 (treatment phase, 95% CI-euro152 to euro25) and euro908 (3 months, 95% CI-euro553 to euro2296). The savings per quality-adjusted life-year lost were euro31,111 from a health care perspective. From a societal perspective, HOSP was dominant.

11570,Using whole disease modeling to inform resource allocation decisions: economic evaluation of a clinical guideline for colorectal cancer using a single model,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and value of simulating whole disease and treatment pathways within a single model to provide a common economic basis for informing resource allocation decisions. METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was developed with the intention of being capable of evaluating multiple topics within National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence''s colorectal cancer clinical guideline. The model simulates disease and treatment pathways from preclinical disease through to detection, diagnosis, adjuvant/neoadjuvant treatments, follow-up, curative/palliative treatments for metastases, supportive care, and eventual death. The model parameters were informed by meta-analyses, randomized trials, observational studies, health utility studies, audit data, costing sources, and expert opinion. Unobservable natural history parameters were calibrated against external data using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Economic analysis was undertaken using conventional cost-utility decision rules within each guideline topic and constrained maximization rules across multiple topics. RESULTS: Under usual processes for guideline development, piecewise economic modeling would have been used to evaluate between one and three topics. The Whole Disease Model was capable of evaluating 11 of 15 guideline topics, ranging from alternative diagnostic technologies through to treatments for metastatic disease. The constrained maximization analysis identified a configuration of colorectal services that is expected to maximize quality-adjusted life-year gains without exceeding current expenditure levels.

Economic analysis was undertaken using conventional cost-utility decision rules within each guideline topic and constrained maximization rules across multiple topics. RESULTS: Under usual processes for guideline development, piecewise economic modeling would have been used to evaluate between one and three topics. The Whole Disease Model was capable of evaluating 11 of 15 guideline topics, ranging from alternative diagnostic technologies through to treatments for metastatic disease. The constrained maximization analysis identified a configuration of colorectal services that is expected to maximize quality-adjusted life-year gains without exceeding current expenditure levels.

Screening with a blood test could improve screening rates. We estimated the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of colorectal cancer screening with emerging biomarkers, illustrated by a methylated Septin 9 DNA plasma assay ((m)SEPT9), versus established strategies. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using a validated decision analytic model comparing (m)SEPT9, fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), sigmoidoscopy, and colonoscopy, projecting lifetime benefits and costs. RESULTS: In the base case, (m)SEPT9 decreased colorectal cancer incidence by 35% to 41% and colorectal cancer mortality by 53% to 61% at costs of $8,400 to $11,500/quality-adjusted life year gained versus no screening. All established screening strategies were more effective than (m)SEPT9. FIT was cost saving, dominated (m)SEPT9, and was preferred among all the alternatives. Screening uptake and longitudinal adherence rates over time strongly influenced the comparisons between strategies. At the population level, (m)SEPT9 yielded incremental benefit at acceptable costs when it increased the fraction of the population screened more than it was substituted for other strategies. CONCLUSIONS: (m)SEPT9 seems to be effective and cost-effective compared with no screening. To be cost-effective compared with established strategies, (m)SEPT9 or blood-based biomarkers with similar test performance characteristics would need to achieve substantially higher uptake and adherence rates than the alternatives.

11594,The cost-effectiveness of shopping to a predetermined grocery list to reduce overweight and obesity,"BACKGROUND: Pre-commitment strategies can encourage participants to commit to a healthy food plan and have been suggested as a potential strategy for weight loss. However, it is unclear whether such strategies are cost-effective. OBJECTIVE: To analyse whether pre-commitment interventions that facilitate healthier diets are a cost-effective approach to tackle obesity. METHODS: Effectiveness evidence was obtained from a systematic review of the literature. For interventions demonstrating a clinically significant change in weight, a Markov model was employed to simulate the long-term health and economic consequences. The review supported modelling just one intervention: grocery shopping to a predetermined list combined with standard behavioural therapy (SBT). SBT alone and do nothing were used as comparators. The target population was overweight or obese adult women. A lifetime horizon for health effects (expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) and costs from the perspective of the UK health sector were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the pre-commitment strategy of shopping to a list was found to be more effective and cost saving when compared against SBT, and cost-effective when compared against ''do nothing'' (ICER= pound166 per QALY gained).

11596,Assessing long-term health and cost outcomes of patient-centered medical homes serving adults with poor diabetes control,"The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is an integrated primary care delivery model particularly suited for patients with poor diabetes control. Although PCMH models targeting adults with diabetes have shown some early success, little is known about the long-term benefits of medical homes in terms of health and cost outcomes. The performance of a PCMH model in adults with poor diabetes control was assessed using simulated controlled trial data obtained from the Archimedes model of disease progression and health care utilization. Using the Cardio-Metabolic Risk data set, we compared health and cost outcomes over a 20-year period between adults with poor diabetes control (HbA1c >9%) receiving standard care and these same adults receiving care under a PCMH model with a 49% HbA1c intervention improvement rate at a per-beneficiary per-month care management cost of $20 per month. The results suggest that the PCMH model has the potential to not only reduce the proportion of the population with bilateral blindness, foot amputations, and myocardial infarctions-and the mortality rate-but it can also do so in a cost-effective manner ($7898 per quality-adjusted life year). The PCMH model is cost saving for the population 50 to 64 years old and it is particularly cost-effective for men ($883 per quality-adjusted life year). Moreover, these effects are relatively large for adults 30 to 49 years old (lower bilateral blindness and death rates), women (lower foot amputation and death rates), and men (lower bilateral blindness and myocardial infarction rates).

Moreover, these effects are relatively large for adults 30 to 49 years old (lower bilateral blindness and death rates), women (lower foot amputation and death rates), and men (lower bilateral blindness and myocardial infarction rates). The PCMH model has potential long-term benefits to both patients with poor diabetes control as well as health care systems and providers willing to invest in this health care delivery approach.",2013-01-11559,23799676,J Prim Care Community Health,Jose A Pagan,2013,4 / 4,,No,23799676,"Jose A Pagan; Erin K Carlson; Assessing long-term health and cost outcomes of patient-centered medical homes serving adults with poor diabetes control, J Prim Care Community Health, 2013 Oct; 4(4):2150-1327",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Patient centered medical home vs. Standard/Usual Care,HbA1c >9%,64 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2011,Not Stated
11599,Assessing long-term health and cost outcomes of patient-centered medical homes serving adults with poor diabetes control,"The patient-centered medical home (PCMH) is an integrated primary care delivery model particularly suited for patients with poor diabetes control. Although PCMH models targeting adults with diabetes have shown some early success, little is known about the long-term benefits of medical homes in terms of health and cost outcomes. The performance of a PCMH model in adults with poor diabetes control was assessed using simulated controlled trial data obtained from the Archimedes model of disease progression and health care utilization. Using the Cardio-Metabolic Risk data set, we compared health and cost outcomes over a 20-year period between adults with poor diabetes control (HbA1c >9%) receiving standard care and these same adults receiving care under a PCMH model with a 49% HbA1c intervention improvement rate at a per-beneficiary per-month care management cost of $20 per month.
