31601,Cost-effectiveness of routine and campaign use of typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccine in Gavi-eligible countries: a modelling study,"BACKGROUND: Typhoid fever is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low-income and middle-income countries. In 2017, WHO recommended the programmatic use of typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccine (TCV) in endemic settings, and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has pledged support for vaccine introduction in these countries. Country-level health economic evaluations are now needed to inform decision-making. METHODS: In this modelling study, we compared four strategies: no vaccination, routine immunisation at 9 months, and routine immunisation at 9 months with catch-up campaigns to either age 5 years or 15 years. For each of the 54 countries eligible for Gavi support, output from an age-structured transmission-dynamic model was combined with country-specific treatment and vaccine-related costs, treatment outcomes, and disability weights to estimate the reduction in typhoid burden, identify the strategy that maximised average net benefit (ie, the optimal strategy) across a range of country-specific willingness-to-pay (WTP) values, estimate and investigate the uncertainties surrounding our findings, and identify the epidemiological conditions under which vaccination is optimal. FINDINGS: The optimal strategy was either no vaccination or TCV immunisation including a catch-up campaign. Routine vaccination with a catch-up campaign to 15 years of age was optimal in 38 countries, assuming a WTP value of at least US$200 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, or assuming a WTP value of at least 25% of each country''s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per DALY averted, at a vaccine price of $1.50 per dose (but excluding Gavi''s contribution according to each country''s transition phase). This vaccination strategy was also optimal in 48 countries assuming a WTP of at least $500 per DALY averted, in 51 with assumed WTP values of at least $1000, in 47 countries assuming a WTP value of at least 50% of GDP per capita per DALY averted, and in 49 assuming a minimum of 100%. Vaccination was likely to be cost-effective in countries with 300 or more typhoid cases per 100 000 person-years. Uncertainty about the probability of hospital admission (and typhoid incidence and mortality) had the greatest influence on the optimal strategy. INTERPRETATION: Countries should establish their own WTP threshold and consider routine TCV introduction, including a catch-up campaign when vaccination is optimal on the basis of this threshold. Obtaining improved estimates of the probability of hospital admission would be valuable whenever the optimal strategy is uncertain.

In 2017, WHO recommended the programmatic use of typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccine (TCV) in endemic settings, and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has pledged support for vaccine introduction in these countries. Country-level health economic evaluations are now needed to inform decision-making. METHODS: In this modelling study, we compared four strategies: no vaccination, routine immunisation at 9 months, and routine immunisation at 9 months with catch-up campaigns to either age 5 years or 15 years. For each of the 54 countries eligible for Gavi support, output from an age-structured transmission-dynamic model was combined with country-specific treatment and vaccine-related costs, treatment outcomes, and disability weights to estimate the reduction in typhoid burden, identify the strategy that maximised average net benefit (ie, the optimal strategy) across a range of country-specific willingness-to-pay (WTP) values, estimate and investigate the uncertainties surrounding our findings, and identify the epidemiological conditions under which vaccination is optimal. FINDINGS: The optimal strategy was either no vaccination or TCV immunisation including a catch-up campaign. Routine vaccination with a catch-up campaign to 15 years of age was optimal in 38 countries, assuming a WTP value of at least US$200 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, or assuming a WTP value of at least 25% of each country''s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per DALY averted, at a vaccine price of $1.50 per dose (but excluding Gavi''s contribution according to each country''s transition phase). This vaccination strategy was also optimal in 48 countries assuming a WTP of at least $500 per DALY averted, in 51 with assumed WTP values of at least $1000, in 47 countries assuming a WTP value of at least 50% of GDP per capita per DALY averted, and in 49 assuming a minimum of 100%. Vaccination was likely to be cost-effective in countries with 300 or more typhoid cases per 100 000 person-years.

In 2017, WHO recommended the programmatic use of typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccine (TCV) in endemic settings, and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has pledged support for vaccine introduction in these countries. Country-level health economic evaluations are now needed to inform decision-making. METHODS: In this modelling study, we compared four strategies: no vaccination, routine immunisation at 9 months, and routine immunisation at 9 months with catch-up campaigns to either age 5 years or 15 years. For each of the 54 countries eligible for Gavi support, output from an age-structured transmission-dynamic model was combined with country-specific treatment and vaccine-related costs, treatment outcomes, and disability weights to estimate the reduction in typhoid burden, identify the strategy that maximised average net benefit (ie, the optimal strategy) across a range of country-specific willingness-to-pay (WTP) values, estimate and investigate the uncertainties surrounding our findings, and identify the epidemiological conditions under which vaccination is optimal. FINDINGS: The optimal strategy was either no vaccination or TCV immunisation including a catch-up campaign. Routine vaccination with a catch-up campaign to 15 years of age was optimal in 38 countries, assuming a WTP value of at least US$200 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, or assuming a WTP value of at least 25% of each country''s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per DALY averted, at a vaccine price of $1.50 per dose (but excluding Gavi''s contribution according to each country''s transition phase). This vaccination strategy was also optimal in 48 countries assuming a WTP of at least $500 per DALY averted, in 51 with assumed WTP values of at least $1000, in 47 countries assuming a WTP value of at least 50% of GDP per capita per DALY averted, and in 49 assuming a minimum of 100%.

In 2017, WHO recommended the programmatic use of typhoid Vi-conjugate vaccine (TCV) in endemic settings, and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance, has pledged support for vaccine introduction in these countries. Country-level health economic evaluations are now needed to inform decision-making. METHODS: In this modelling study, we compared four strategies: no vaccination, routine immunisation at 9 months, and routine immunisation at 9 months with catch-up campaigns to either age 5 years or 15 years. For each of the 54 countries eligible for Gavi support, output from an age-structured transmission-dynamic model was combined with country-specific treatment and vaccine-related costs, treatment outcomes, and disability weights to estimate the reduction in typhoid burden, identify the strategy that maximised average net benefit (ie, the optimal strategy) across a range of country-specific willingness-to-pay (WTP) values, estimate and investigate the uncertainties surrounding our findings, and identify the epidemiological conditions under which vaccination is optimal. FINDINGS: The optimal strategy was either no vaccination or TCV immunisation including a catch-up campaign. Routine vaccination with a catch-up campaign to 15 years of age was optimal in 38 countries, assuming a WTP value of at least US$200 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, or assuming a WTP value of at least 25% of each country''s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita per DALY averted, at a vaccine price of $1.50 per dose (but excluding Gavi''s contribution according to each country''s transition phase). This vaccination strategy was also optimal in 48 countries assuming a WTP of at least $500 per DALY averted, in 51 with assumed WTP values of at least $1000, in 47 countries assuming a WTP value of at least 50% of GDP per capita per DALY averted, and in 49 assuming a minimum of 100%. Vaccination was likely to be cost-effective in countries with 300 or more typhoid cases per 100 000 person-years.

31636,Evaluation of intensified dengue control measures with interrupted time series analysis in the Panadura Medical Officer of Health division in Sri Lanka: a case study and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Dengue has become a major public health problem in Sri Lanka with a considerable economic burden. As a response, in June, 2014, the Ministry of Health initiated a proactive vector control programme in partnership with military and police forces, known as the Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) programme, that was targeted at high-risk Medical Officer of Health (MOH) divisions in the country. Evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of population-level interventions is essential to guide public health planning and resource allocation decisions, particularly in resource-limited health-care settings. METHODS: Using an interrupted time series design with a non-linear extension, we evaluated the impact of vector control interventions from June 22, 2014, to Dec 29, 2016, in Panadura, a high-risk MOH division in Western Province, Sri Lanka. We used dengue notification and larval survey data to estimate the reduction in Breteau index and dengue incidence before and after the intervention using two separate models, adjusting for time-varying confounding variables (ie, rainfall, temperature, and the Oceanic Nino Index). We also assessed the cost and cost-effectiveness of the CIMIC programme from the perspective of the National Dengue Control Unit under the scenarios of different levels of hospitalisation of dengue cases (low [25%], medium [50%], and high [75%]) in terms of cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted (DALY). FINDINGS: Vector control interventions had a significant impact on combined Breteau index (relative risk reduction 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.70) and on dengue incidence (0.43, 0.28 to 0.67), the latter becoming prominent 2 months after the intervention onset. The mean number of averted dengue cases was estimated at 2192 (95% CI 1741 to 2643), and the total cost of the CIMIC programme at 2016 US$271 615. Personnel costs accounted for about 89% of the total cost. In the base-case scenario of moderate level of hospitalisation, the CIMIC programme was cost-saving with a probability of 70% under both the lowest ($453) and highest ($1686) cost-effectiveness thresholds, resulting in a net saving of $20 247 (95% CI -57 266 to 97 790) and averting 176 DALYs (133 to 226), leading to a cost of -$98 (-497 to 395) per DALY averted. This was also the case for the scenario with high hospitalisation levels (cost per DALY averted -$512, 95% CI -872 to -115) but with a higher probability of 99%. In the scenario with low hospitalisation levels (cost per DALY averted $690, 143 to 1379), although the CIMIC programme was cost-ineffective at the lowest threshold with a probability of 77%, it was cost-effective at the highest threshold with a probability of 99%. INTERPRETATION: This study suggests that communities affected by dengue can benefit from investments in vector control if interventions are implemented rigorously and coordinated well across sectors.

31637,Evaluation of intensified dengue control measures with interrupted time series analysis in the Panadura Medical Officer of Health division in Sri Lanka: a case study and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Dengue has become a major public health problem in Sri Lanka with a considerable economic burden. As a response, in June, 2014, the Ministry of Health initiated a proactive vector control programme in partnership with military and police forces, known as the Civil-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) programme, that was targeted at high-risk Medical Officer of Health (MOH) divisions in the country. Evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of population-level interventions is essential to guide public health planning and resource allocation decisions, particularly in resource-limited health-care settings. METHODS: Using an interrupted time series design with a non-linear extension, we evaluated the impact of vector control interventions from June 22, 2014, to Dec 29, 2016, in Panadura, a high-risk MOH division in Western Province, Sri Lanka. We used dengue notification and larval survey data to estimate the reduction in Breteau index and dengue incidence before and after the intervention using two separate models, adjusting for time-varying confounding variables (ie, rainfall, temperature, and the Oceanic Nino Index). We also assessed the cost and cost-effectiveness of the CIMIC programme from the perspective of the National Dengue Control Unit under the scenarios of different levels of hospitalisation of dengue cases (low [25%], medium [50%], and high [75%]) in terms of cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted (DALY). FINDINGS: Vector control interventions had a significant impact on combined Breteau index (relative risk reduction 0.43, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.70) and on dengue incidence (0.43, 0.28 to 0.67), the latter becoming prominent 2 months after the intervention onset. The mean number of averted dengue cases was estimated at 2192 (95% CI 1741 to 2643), and the total cost of the CIMIC programme at 2016 US$271 615. Personnel costs accounted for about 89% of the total cost.

31652,Adjuvant trastuzumab chemotherapy in early breast cancer: meta-analysis of randomised trials and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab has a large financial impact on the average cost of breast cancer treatment. This study reassessed the cost-effectiveness of listing the drug on the subsidised Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. METHODS: Using a continuous-time, discrete-event microsimulation model, we examined the effect of 1-year trastuzumab on the total number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted among Australian women with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) positive early breast cancer. Target population was women aged 30&ndash;100 years and newly diagnosed with the disease in 2003. The model adjusted for tumour size and followed the women up until death or age 100 years. Uncertainty was examined in univariate and probabilistic multivariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was A$132,537 (95% confidence interval 91,172&ndash;200,485) per DALY averted. Results were sensitive to restriction of trastuzumab to high-risk (large tumour) and/or high-benefit (young) patients. Suitable combinations of tumour size and age restrictions would improve the cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab. Specifically, restricting trastuzumab to women aged 40 years or younger with tumour sizes 40+ mm reduced the ICER to A$35,290 per DALY averted. CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab for HER2-positive early breast cancer had a high ICER. It is unclear why the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme listing does not use restrictions to improve the cost-effectiveness of the drug.",2019-99-29517,31104310,Swiss Med Wkly,Tan Nhut Doan,2019,149 /,w20082,No,31104310,"Tan Nhut Doan; Jan Barendregt; Adjuvant trastuzumab chemotherapy in early breast cancer: meta-analysis of randomised trials and cost-effectiveness analysis, Swiss Med Wkly, 2019 May 6; 149():1424-7860; w20082",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard adjuvant chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,132537,Australia,2017,107310

31659,Assessment of the Feasibility and Cost of Hepatitis C Elimination in Pakistan,"Importance: Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a global health problem. The World Health Assembly recently pledged to eliminate HCV by 2030. However, in Pakistan, a country with one of the highest prevalence rates, the feasibility and cost of HCV elimination are not known. Objectives: To investigate whether and under what conditions HCV elimination is feasible in Pakistan and to estimate the cost of such elimination. Design, Setting, and Participants: This decision analytical model study used a microsimulation model of the HCV epidemic in Pakistan from 2015 to 2030. Using Pakistan-specific variables, the model simulated the landscape of HCV in Pakistan and evaluated the minimum required screening and treatment rates needed to eliminate HCV in Pakistan. The study used simulated individuals chronically infected with HCV from 2015 to 2030. The analysis was performed in 2018. Interventions: The status quo and 7 scenarios that can lead to HCV elimination in Pakistan by 2030, which were defined by different combinations of tests for screening, detection of viremia before treatment, and confirmation of treatment response. Main Outcomes and Measures: Temporal trends in HCV infection prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life-years and total cost of HCV infection care under the status quo and scenarios that can eliminate HCV by 2030. Results: Under the status quo, from 2015 to 2030, 1.44 million people are projected to die of HCV infection; 48% of deaths would be among people younger than 50 years. To achieve HCV elimination in Pakistan, HCV testing would need to be scaled up to at least 25 million people to diagnose 900 000 persons and treatment to 700000 people per year. Compared with the status quo, the elimination scenario would avert 323 000 liver-related deaths and 13.0 million HCV-associated disability-adjusted life-years from 2015 to 2030. The elimination scenario was associated with cost savings of $2.6 billion from 2018 to 2030 with use of a point-of-care test for population-wide antibody screening and detection of viremia and treatment response. Conclusions and Relevance: Substantial scale-up of HCV testing and treatment may be essential to eliminate HCV infection in Pakistan, and such a strategy may be associated with cost savings in the near future.

31660,Are community health workers cost-effective for childhood vaccination in India?,"INTRODUCTION: Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) are female community health workers whose primary role is to promote utilization of primary healthcare services and improve sanitation in rural areas and are financially incentivized for services provided. Prior studies evaluating ASHAs have been largely qualitative, and assess their knowledge, skills, and practice. Globally, there have been very few studies that have quantitatively assessed community health workers. We analyzed the cost effectiveness of ASHAs in facilitating measles vaccination among children under 5years during 2012-2013. METHODS: We utilized Markov modeling simulating a cohort of children in villages with and without ASHAs. We extrapolated the health states to a lifetime of 68years to estimate the effects of ASHA intervention. Measles vaccination rates were obtained from 2013 District Level Household and Facilities Survey 4. Other parameter estimates were obtained from a review of relevant literature. RESULTS: ASHA intervention was highly cost effective at $162 per DALY averted compared to no ASHA and remained cost effective with the ASHA incentive increased from $2 to $15, across the range of probabilities and cost parameters. Analyses were sensitive to probability of death due to childhood pneumonia, susceptibility to measles after one dose measles vaccine, and probability of pneumonia after measles infection. CONCLUSION: ASHAs were cost-effective under a wide range of scenarios even when a single health outcome such as measles vaccination was considered. The Government of India and individual state governments of India should consider increasing the incentives provided to ASHAs.",2019-01-05021,31010713,Br. Med.

31661,An Economic Evaluation of a Comprehensive School-Based Caries Prevention Program,"INTRODUCTION: Current economic evaluations of school-based caries prevention programs (SCPPs) do not compare multiple types of SCPPs against each other and do not consider teeth beyond permanent first molars. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive SCPP relative to an SCPP focused on delivering sealants for permanent first molars only and to a default of no SCPP. Based on a societal perspective, a simulation model was used that compared the health and cost impacts on 1) permanent first molars only and 2) all posterior teeth. METHODS: To calibrate the model, we used data from CariedAway, a comprehensive SCPP that used glass ionomer to prevent and arrest active decay among children. We then evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness of implementing 3 alternate school-based approaches (comprehensive, sealant only, and no program) on only first molars and all posterior teeth. Probabilistic, 1-, and 2-way sensitivity analyses are included for robustness. Cost-effectiveness is assessed with a threshold of $54,639 per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY). RESULTS: We first compared the 3 programs under the assumption of treating only first molars. This assessment indicated that CariedAway was less cost-effective than school-based sealant programs (SSPs): the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CariedAway versus SSPs was $283,455 per averted DALY. However, when the model was extended to include CariedAway''s treatment of all posterior teeth, CariedAway was not only cost-effective but also cost-saving relative to SSPs (ICER, -$943,460.88 per averted DALY; net cost, -$261.45) and no SCPP (ICER, -$400,645.52 per averted DALY; net cost, -$239.77). CONCLUSIONS: This study finds that economic evaluations assessing only cost and health impacts on permanent first molars may underestimate the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive SCPPs 1) preventing and arresting decay and 2) treating all teeth. Hence, there is an urgent need for economic evaluations of SCPPs to assess cost and health impacts across teeth beyond only permanent first molars.

31664,Sustaining pneumococcal vaccination after transitioning from Gavi support: a modelling and cost-effectiveness study in Kenya,"BACKGROUND: In 2009, Gavi, the World Bank, and donors launched the pneumococcal Advance Market Commitment, which helped countries access more affordable pneumococcal vaccines. As many low-income countries begin to reach the threshold at which countries transition from Gavi support to self-financing (3-year average gross national income per capita of US$1580), they will need to consider whether to continue pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) use at full cost or to discontinue PCV in their childhood immunisation programmes. Using Kenya as a case study, we assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuing PCV use. METHODS: In this modelling and cost-effectiveness study, we fitted a dynamic compartmental model of pneumococcal carriage to annual carriage prevalence surveys and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence in Kilifi, Kenya. We predicted disease incidence and related mortality for either continuing PCV use beyond 2022, the start of Kenya''s transition from Gavi support, or its discontinuation. We calculated the costs per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted and associated 95% prediction intervals (PI). FINDINGS: We predicted that if PCV use is discontinued in Kenya in 2022, overall IPD incidence will increase from 8.5 per 100 000 in 2022, to 16.2 per 100 000 per year in 2032. Continuing vaccination would prevent 14 329 (95% PI 6130-25 256) deaths and 101 513 (4386-196 674) disease cases during that time. Continuing PCV after 2022 will require an estimated additional US$15.8 million annually compared with discontinuing vaccination. We predicted that the incremental cost per DALY averted of continuing PCV would be $153 (95% PI 70-411) in 2032. INTERPRETATION: Continuing PCV use is essential to sustain its health gains. Based on the Kenyan GDP per capita of $1445, and in comparison to other vaccines, continued PCV use at full costs is cost-effective (on the basis of the assumption that any reduction in disease will translate to a reduction in mortality). Although affordability is likely to be a concern, our findings support an expansion of the vaccine budget in Kenya.

31665,The Public Health Benefits and Economic Value of Routine Yellow Fever Vaccination in Colombia,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the public health benefits and economic value of live-attenuated yellow fever (YF) 17D vaccine in Colombia. METHODS: A decision tree model was used to assess the theoretical impact of routine YF vaccination of 1-year-olds (no ""catch-up"") during the interepidemic period from 1980 to 2002, avoiding capturing the impact of YF vaccine introduction in 2003. The vaccine was assumed to be 99% effective, to provide lifetime protection, and to cover 85% of the target population. Costs per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted were computed from payer and societal perspectives. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: During the interepidemic period, routine YF vaccination would have averted 2223 nonfatal cases of YF and 65 deaths, leading to an overall reduction of 1365 DALYs. The net cost of this vaccination would have been $25 964 813 (payer''s perspective) and $16 535 465 (societal perspective). Cost per DALY averted was $19 022 and $12 114 from payer and societal perspectives, respectively (all costs in 2015 US dollars). Vaccination was considered cost-effective from both perspectives (ie, between 1- and 3-fold the gross domestic product per capita, $7158) and remains so if price per dose was $2.75 or less and $4.66 from payer and societal perspectives, respectively.

31667,Economic value of vaccinating geographically hard-to-reach populations with measles vaccine: A modeling application in Kenya,"BACKGROUND: Since special efforts are necessary to vaccinate people living far from fixed vaccination posts, decision makers are interested in knowing the economic value of such efforts. METHODS: Using our immunization geospatial information system platform and a measles compartment model, we quantified the health and economic value of a 2-dose measles immunization outreach strategy for children <24months of age in Kenya who are geographically hard-to-reach (i.e., those living outside a specified catchment radius from fixed vaccination posts, which served as a proxy for access to services). FINDINGS: When geographically hard-to-reach children were not vaccinated, there were 1427 total measles cases from 2016 to 2020, resulting in $9.5million ($3.1-$18.1million) in direct medical costs and productivity losses and 7504 (3338-12,903) disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).

31670,Economic evaluation of the hepatitis C elimination strategy in Greece in the era of affordable direct-acting antivirals,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading cause of worldwide liver-related morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization released an integrated strategy targeting HCV-elimination by 2030. This study aims to estimate the required interventions to achieve elimination using updated information for direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment coverage, to compute the total costs (including indirect/societal costs) of the strategy and to identify whether the elimination strategy is cost-effective/cost-saving in Greece. AIM: To estimate the required interventions and subsequent costs to achieve HCV elimination in Greece. METHODS: A previously validated mathematical model was adapted to the Greek HCV-infected population to compare the outcomes of DAA treatment without the additional implementation of awareness or screening campaigns versus an HCV elimination strategy, which includes a sufficient number of treated patients. We estimated the total costs (direct and indirect costs), the disability-adjusted life years and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using two different price scenarios. RESULTS: Without the implementation of awareness or screening campaigns, approximately 20000 patients would be diagnosed and treated with DAAs by 2030. This strategy would result in a 19.6% increase in HCV-related mortality in 2030 compared to 2015. To achieve the elimination goal, 90000 patients need to be treated by 2030. Under the elimination scenario, viremic cases would decrease by 78.8% in 2030 compared to 2015. The cumulative direct costs to eliminate the disease would range from 2.1-2.3 billion euros (euro) by 2030, while the indirect costs would be euro1.1 billion. The total elimination cost in Greece would range from euro3.2-3.4 billion by 2030. The cost per averted disability-adjusted life year is estimated between euro10100 and euro13380, indicating that the elimination strategy is very cost-effective. Furthermore, HCV elimination strategy would save euro560-895 million by 2035. CONCLUSION: Without large screening programs, elimination of HCV cannot be achieved.

This study aims to estimate the required interventions to achieve elimination using updated information for direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment coverage, to compute the total costs (including indirect/societal costs) of the strategy and to identify whether the elimination strategy is cost-effective/cost-saving in Greece. AIM: To estimate the required interventions and subsequent costs to achieve HCV elimination in Greece. METHODS: A previously validated mathematical model was adapted to the Greek HCV-infected population to compare the outcomes of DAA treatment without the additional implementation of awareness or screening campaigns versus an HCV elimination strategy, which includes a sufficient number of treated patients. We estimated the total costs (direct and indirect costs), the disability-adjusted life years and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using two different price scenarios. RESULTS: Without the implementation of awareness or screening campaigns, approximately 20000 patients would be diagnosed and treated with DAAs by 2030. This strategy would result in a 19.6% increase in HCV-related mortality in 2030 compared to 2015. To achieve the elimination goal, 90000 patients need to be treated by 2030. Under the elimination scenario, viremic cases would decrease by 78.8% in 2030 compared to 2015. The cumulative direct costs to eliminate the disease would range from 2.1-2.3 billion euros (euro) by 2030, while the indirect costs would be euro1.1 billion. The total elimination cost in Greece would range from euro3.2-3.4 billion by 2030. The cost per averted disability-adjusted life year is estimated between euro10100 and euro13380, indicating that the elimination strategy is very cost-effective. Furthermore, HCV elimination strategy would save euro560-895 million by 2035. CONCLUSION: Without large screening programs, elimination of HCV cannot be achieved. The HCV elimination strategy is feasible and cost-saving despite the uncertainty of the future cost of DAAs in Greece.",2019-99-30004,30918426,World J Gastroenterol,Ilias Gountas,2019,25 / 11,1327-1340,No,30918426,"Ilias Gountas; Vana Sypsa; George Papatheodoridis; Kyriakos Souliotis; Kostas Athanasakis; Homie Razavi; Angelos Hatzakis; Economic evaluation of the hepatitis C elimination strategy in Greece in the era of affordable direct-acting antivirals, World J Gastroenterol, 2019 Mar 21; 25(11):1007-9327; 1327-1340",DALY,Greece,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Elimination of Hepatitis C by using direct-acting antivirals vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,", 20 years",3.00,3.00,133846.15,Euro,2017,159701.11
31672,Modeling the economic impact of different vial-opening thresholds for measles-containing vaccines,"INTRODUCTION: The lack of specific policies on how many children must be present at a vaccinating location before a healthcare worker can open a measles-containing vaccine (MCV) - i.e. the vial-opening threshold - has led to inconsistent practices, which can have wide-ranging systems effects. METHODS: Using HERMES-generated simulation models of the routine immunization supply chains of Benin, Mozambique and Niger, we evaluated the impact of different vial-opening thresholds (none, 30% of doses must be used, 60%) and MCV presentations (10-dose, 5-dose) on each supply chain. We linked these outputs to a clinical- and economic-outcomes model which translated the change in vaccine availability to associated infections, medical costs, and DALYs. We calculated the economic impact of each policy from the health system perspective. RESULTS: The vial-opening threshold that maximizes vaccine availability while minimizing costs varies between individual countries. In Benin (median session size=5), implementing a 30% vial-opening threshold and tailoring distribution of 10-dose and 5-dose MCVs to clinics based on session size is the most cost-effective policy, preventing 671 DALYs ($471/DALY averted) compared to baseline (no threshold, 10-dose MCVs). In Niger (median MCV session size=9), setting a 60% vial-opening threshold and tailoring MCV presentations is the most cost-effective policy, preventing 2897 DALYs ($16.05/ DALY averted). In Mozambique (median session size=3), setting a 30% vial-opening threshold using 10-dose MCVs is the only beneficial policy compared to baseline, preventing 3081 DALYs ($85.98/DALY averted). Across all three countries, however, a 30% vial-opening threshold using 10-dose MCVs everywhere is the only MCV threshold that consistently benefits each system compared to baseline. CONCLUSION: While the ideal vial-opening threshold policy for MCV varies by supply chain, implementing a 30% vial-opening threshold for 10-dose MCVs benefits each system by improving overall vaccine availability and reducing associated medical costs and DALYs compared to no threshold.",2019-01-05069,30914223,Mineral.

31675,Best Buy in Public Health or Luxury Expense?: The Cost-effectiveness of a Pediatric Operating Room in Uganda From the Societal Perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of building and maintaining a dedicated pediatric operating room (OR) in Uganda from the societal perspective. BACKGROUND: Despite the heavy burden of pediatric surgical disease in low-income countries, definitive treatment is limited as surgical infrastructure is inadequate to meet the need, leading to preventable morbidity and mortality in children. METHODS: In this economic model, we used a decision tree template to compare the intervention of a dedicated pediatric OR in Uganda for a year versus the absence of a pediatric OR. Costs were included from the government, charity, and patient perspectives. OR and ward case-log informed epidemiological and patient outcomes data, and measured cost per disability adjusted life year averted and cost per life saved. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated between the intervention and counterfactual scenario. Costs are reported in 2015 US$ and inflated by 5.5%. FINDINGS: In Uganda, the implementation of a dedicated pediatric OR has an ICER of $37.25 per disability adjusted life year averted or $3321 per life saved, compared with no existing operating room. The ICER is well below multiple cost-effectiveness thresholds including one times the country''s gross domestic product per capita ($694). The ICER remained robust under 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Our model ICER suggests that the construction and maintenance of a dedicated pediatric operating room in sub-Saharan Africa is very-cost effective if hospital space and personnel pre-exist to staff the facility. This supports infrastructure implementation for surgery in sub-Saharan Africa as a worthwhile investment.",2019-99-30028,30907755,Ann Surg,Ava Yap,2019,/,,No,30907755,"Ava Yap; Maija Cheung; Arlene Muzira; James Healy; Nasser Kakembo; Phyllis Kisa; David Cunningham; George Youngson; John Sekabira; Reza Yaesoubi; Doruk Ozgediz; Best Buy in Public Health or Luxury Expense?: The Cost-effectiveness of a Pediatric Operating Room in Uganda From the Societal Perspective, Ann Surg, 2019 Mar 19; ():0003-4932",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Surgical",Dedicated Pediatric Operating Room vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,Not Stated,Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,37.25,United States,2015,40.68
31676,The impact and cost-effectiveness of community-based HIV self-testing in sub-Saharan Africa: a health economic and modelling analysis,"INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of undiagnosed HIV is declining in Africa, and various HIV testing approaches are finding lower positivity rates. In this context, the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of community-based HIV self-testing (CB-HIVST) is unclear. We aimed to assess this in different sub-populations and across scenarios characterized by different adult HIV prevalence and antiretroviral treatment programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: The synthesis model was used to address this aim. Three sub-populations were considered for CB-HIVST: (i) women having transactional sex (WTS); (ii) young people (15 to 24 years); and (iii) adult men (25 to 49 years). We assumed uptake of CB-HIVST similar to that reported in epidemiological studies (base case), or assumed people use CB-HIVST only if exposed to risk (condomless sex) since last HIV test. We also considered a five-year time-limited CB-HIVST programme. Cost-effectiveness was defined by an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; cost-per-disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted) below US$500 over a time horizon of 50 years. The efficiency of targeted CB-HIVST was evaluated using the number of additional tests per infection or death averted. RESULTS: In the base case, targeting adult men with CB-HIVST offered the greatest impact, averting 1500 HIV infections and 520 deaths per year in the context of a simulated country with nine million adults, and impact could be enhanced by linkage to voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). However, the approach was only cost-effective if the programme was limited to five years or the undiagnosed prevalence was above 3%. CB-HIVST to WTS was the most cost-effective. The main drivers of cost-effectiveness were the cost of CB-HIVST and the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV. All other CB-HIVST scenarios had an ICER above US$500 per DALY averted. CONCLUSIONS: CB-HIVST showed an important epidemiological impact. To maximize population health within a fixed budget, CB-HIVST needs to be targeted on the basis of the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV, sub-population and the overall costs of delivering this testing modality.

Cost-effectiveness was defined by an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; cost-per-disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted) below US$500 over a time horizon of 50 years. The efficiency of targeted CB-HIVST was evaluated using the number of additional tests per infection or death averted. RESULTS: In the base case, targeting adult men with CB-HIVST offered the greatest impact, averting 1500 HIV infections and 520 deaths per year in the context of a simulated country with nine million adults, and impact could be enhanced by linkage to voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). However, the approach was only cost-effective if the programme was limited to five years or the undiagnosed prevalence was above 3%. CB-HIVST to WTS was the most cost-effective. The main drivers of cost-effectiveness were the cost of CB-HIVST and the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV. All other CB-HIVST scenarios had an ICER above US$500 per DALY averted. CONCLUSIONS: CB-HIVST showed an important epidemiological impact. To maximize population health within a fixed budget, CB-HIVST needs to be targeted on the basis of the prevalence of undiagnosed HIV, sub-population and the overall costs of delivering this testing modality.

This study aims to assess the population impacts and cost-effectiveness of this integrated approach in the Cambodian context. METHODS: Based on existing frameworks for the EMTCT for each individual infection, an integrated framework that combines infection prevention procedures with routine antenatal care was constructed. Using decision tree analyses, population impacts, cost-effectiveness and the potential reduction in required resources of the integrated approach as a result of resource pooling and improvements in service coverage and coordination, were evaluated. The tool was assessed using simulated epidemiological data from Cambodia. RESULTS: The current prevention programme for 370,000 Cambodian pregnant women was estimated at USD$2.3 ($2.0-$2.5) million per year, including the duration of pregnancy and up to 18 months after delivery. A model estimate of current MTCT rates in Cambodia was 6.6% (6.2-7.1%) for HIV, 14.1% (13.1-15.2%) for HBV and 9.4% (9.0-9.8%) for syphilis. Integrating HIV and syphilis prevention into the existing antenatal care framework will reduce the total time required to provide this integrated care by 19% for health care workers and by 32% for pregnant women, resulting in a net saving of $380,000 per year for the EMTCT programme. This integrated approach reduces HIV and HBV MTCT to 6.1% (5.7-6.5%) and 13.0% (12.1-14.0%), respectively, and substantially reduces syphilis MCTC to 4.6% (4.3-5.0%).

31686,The cost effectiveness of treating Burkitt lymphoma in Uganda,"BACKGROUND: Perceptions of high cost and resource intensity remain political barriers to the prioritization of childhood cancer treatment programs in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Little knowledge exists of the actual cost and cost-effectiveness of such programs. To improve outcomes for children with Burkitt lymphoma (BL), the most common childhood cancer in Africa, the Uganda Cancer Institute implemented a comprehensive BL treatment program in 2012. We undertook an economic evaluation of the program to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of BL therapy in a specific LIC setting. METHODS: We compared the treatment of BL to usual care in a cohort of 122 patients treated between 2012 and 2014. Costs included variable, fixed, and family costs. Our primary measure of effectiveness was overall survival (OS). Patient outcomes were determined through prospective capture and retrospective chart abstraction. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted was calculated using the World Health Organization''s Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective (WHO-CHOICE) methodology. RESULTS: The 2-year OS with treatment was 55% (95% CI, 45% to 64%). The cost per DALY averted in the treatment group was US$97 (Int$301). Cumulative estimate of national DALYs averted through treatment was 8607 years, and the total national annual cost of treatment was US$834,879 (Int$2,590,845). The cost of BL treatment fell well within WHO-CHOICE cost-effectiveness thresholds. The ratio of cost per DALY averted to per capita gross domestic product was 0.14, reflecting a very cost-effective intervention. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that treating BL with locally tailored protocols is very cost-effective by international standards. Studies of this kind will furnish crucial evidence to help policymakers prioritize the allocation of LMIC health system resources among noncommunicable diseases, including childhood cancer.",2019-99-30200,30840316,Cancer,Avram E Denburg,2019,125 / 11,1918-1928,No,30840316,"Avram E Denburg; Nazeefah Laher; Innocent Mutyaba; Suzanne McGoldrick; Joyce Kambugu; Erica Sessle; Jackson Orem; Corey Casper; The cost effectiveness of treating Burkitt lymphoma in Uganda, Cancer, 2019 Jun 1; 125(11):0008-543X; 1918-1928",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Diagnostic, Medical Device, Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",Chemotherapy vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,Not Stated,51.99,United States,2015,56.77
31687,The effects of free condom distribution on HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in men who have sex with men,"BACKGROUND: HIV and other sexually transmitted infections remain a burden on men who have sex with men in the era of effective combination antiretroviral therapy. New prevention efforts are therefore needed. One of these approaches is the current country-wide free condom distribution at gay bars with darkrooms and gay saunas in the Netherlands. This study assessed the effects of free condom distribution on incidence and burden of disease of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. METHODS: A static model was constructed to calculate the impact of free condom distribution on HIV, hepatitis C, chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and syphilis among men who have sex with men visiting these venues. Outcomes included new infections averted and disability-adjusted life years averted. Scenario studies were performed to predict the effects of a further increase of condom use, condom effectiveness and coverage. Lastly, cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Our model showed that condom use at public sex venues increased after the intervention. Annual incidence risk decreased, ranging from 5.73% for gonorrhoea to 7.62% for HIV. The annual number of new infections averted was largest for chlamydia and gonorrhoea (261 and 394 infections, respectively), but 42 new HIV infections were averted as well. In scenarios where condom use and condom effectiveness were further increased, the number of infections reduced more extensively. Over 99% of the decrease in burden of disease was due to HIV. The intervention was cost-effective and cost-saving (for every euro1 spent on condom distribution, euro5.51 was saved) and remained this in all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Free condoms at public sex venues could reduce the transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

31688,Household contact investigation for the detection of tuberculosis in Vietnam: economic evaluation of a cluster-randomised trial,"BACKGROUND: Active case finding is recommended as an important strategy to control tuberculosis, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries with a high prevalence of the disease. However, the costs and cost-effectiveness of active case finding are unclear due to the absence of evidence from randomised trials. We assessed the costs and cost-effectiveness of an active case finding strategy in Vietnam, where there is a high prevalence of tuberculosis. METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation alongside the Active Case Finding in Tuberculosis (ACT2) trial-a pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial in 70 districts across eight provinces of Vietnam. Patients aged 15 years and older with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were recruited to the trial if they lived with one or more other household members. Household contacts were verbally invited to the clinic by the index patient with tuberculosis. ACT2 compared a combination of active and passive case finding with usual care (passive case finding) of household contacts of patients with tuberculosis from a health system perspective. Clustering occurred at the district and household level. Districts were the unit of randomisation, and we used minimisation to ensure balance of intervention and control districts within each province. In the intervention group, participants were invited to attend screening at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. We determined health-care costs with a standardised national costing survey and reported results in 2017 $US. The primary outcome of our study was disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted over a 24-month period. ACT2 was registered prospectively with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN126.100.00600044. FINDINGS: Between Aug 11, 2010, and Aug 11, 2015, 10 964 index patients and 25 707 household contacts completed the ACT2 study. There were 10 069 household contacts in the intervention group and 15 638 household contacts in the control group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted was $544 (330-1375). INTERPRETATION: Active case finding was shown to be highly cost-effective in a setting with a high prevalence of tuberculosis.

31689,Population genomic screening of all young adults in a health-care system: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To consider the impact and cost-effectiveness of offering preventive population genomic screening to all young adults in a single-payer health-care system. METHODS: We modeled screening of 2,688,192 individuals, all adults aged 18-25 years in Australia, for pathogenic variants in BRCA1/BRCA2/MLH1/MSH2 genes, and carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and fragile X syndrome (FXS), at 71% testing uptake using per-test costs ranging from AUD$200 to $1200 (~USD$140 to $850). Investment costs included genetic counseling, surveillance, and interventions (reimbursed only) for at-risk individuals/couples. Cost-effectiveness was defined below AUD$50,000/DALY (disability-adjusted life year) prevented, using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), compared with current targeted testing. Outcomes were cancer incidence/mortality, disease cases, and treatment costs reduced. RESULTS: Population screening would reduce variant-attributable cancers by 28.8%, cancer deaths by 31.2%, and CF/SMA/FXS cases by 24.8%, compared with targeted testing. Assuming AUD$400 per test, investment required would be between 4 and 5 times higher than current expenditure. However, screening would lead to substantial savings in medical costs and DALYs prevented, at a highly cost-effective ICER of AUD$4038/DALY.

METHODS: We modeled screening of 2,688,192 individuals, all adults aged 18-25 years in Australia, for pathogenic variants in BRCA1/BRCA2/MLH1/MSH2 genes, and carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and fragile X syndrome (FXS), at 71% testing uptake using per-test costs ranging from AUD$200 to $1200 (~USD$140 to $850). Investment costs included genetic counseling, surveillance, and interventions (reimbursed only) for at-risk individuals/couples. Cost-effectiveness was defined below AUD$50,000/DALY (disability-adjusted life year) prevented, using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), compared with current targeted testing.
