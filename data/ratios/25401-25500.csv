25420,Cost-Effectiveness of Surgery Versus Organ Preservation in Advanced Laryngeal Cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment decision-making for patients with laryngeal cancer consists of a complex trade-off between survival and quality of life. For decision makers on coverage and guidelines, costs come in addition to this equation. Our aim was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of surgery (laryngectomy with or without radiotherapy) versus organ preservation (OP: radiotherapy, chemo- and/or bioradiation) in advanced laryngeal cancer patients from a healthcare perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov model. For each modality, data on survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were sourced from relevant articles in agreement with experts, and national benchmark cost prices were included regarding treatment, follow-up, adverse events, and rehabilitation. RESULTS: Total QALYs of the surgical approach (6.59) were substantially higher compared to the OP approach (5.44). Total lifetime costs were higher for the surgical approach compared to the OP approach, namely €95,881 versus €47,233. The surgical approach was therefore more effective and more costly compared to OP, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €42,383/QALY. CONCLUSION: Based on current literature, surgical treatment was cost-effective compared to OP in advanced laryngeal cancer within most willingness-to-pay thresholds. The study provides information on the survival adjusted for quality of life in combination with costs of two different approaches for advanced laryngeal cancer, relevant for patients, physicians, and policy makers. As financial toxicity is a relevant aspect in this population, collection of real-world data on country-specific costs and utilities is strongly recommended to enable further generalization.

25421,Cost-effectiveness analysis of invasive EEG monitoring in drug-resistant epilepsy,"PURPOSE: Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness of two intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) interventions: 1) stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and 2) placement of subdural grid electrodes (SDGs) both followed by resective surgery in patients with drug-resistant, partial-onset epilepsy, compared with medical management (MM) in Hungary from payer''s perspective. METHODS: The incremental health gains and costs of iEEG interventions have been determined with a combination of a decision tree and prevalence Markov process model over a 30-year time horizon in a cost-utility analysis (CUA). To address the effect of parameter uncertainty on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Our results showed that both SEEG and SDG interventions represent a more expensive but more effective strategy than MM representing the current standard of care. The total discounted cost of SEEG and SDG were € 32,760 and € 25,028 representing € 18,108 and € 10,375 additional cost compared with MM, respectively. However, they provide an additional 3.931 (in SEEG group) and 3.444 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; in SDG group), correspondingly. Thus, the ICER of SEEG is € 4607 per QALY gain, while the ICER for SDG is € 3013 per QALY gain, compared with MM. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of € 41,058 per QALY in Hungary, both subtypes of iEEG interventions are cost-effective and provide good value for money. SIGNIFICANCE: Because of the high cost of implanting electrodes and monitoring, the invasive EEG for patients with refractory epilepsy is currently not available in the Hungarian national healthcare system. Our study demonstrated that these procedures in Hungary are cost-effective compared with the MM. As a result, the introduction of iEEG interventions to the reimbursement list of the National Health Insurance Fund Administration was initiated.",2021-01-34020,33257296,Epilepsy Behav,Sándor Kovács,2021,114 / Pt A,107488,No,33257296,"Sándor Kovács; Márton Tóth; József Janszky; Tamás Dóczi; Dániel Fabó; Imre Boncz; Lajos Botz; Antal Zemplényi; Cost-effectiveness analysis of invasive EEG monitoring in drug-resistant epilepsy, Epilepsy Behav, 2021 Jan; 114(Pt A):1525-5069; 107488",QALY,Hungary,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Medical Procedure, Surgical",stereoelectroencephalography --> resective surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- medical management,"drug-resistant, partial-onset epilepsy",Not Stated,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.70,3.70,4607,Euro,2019,5224.1

25424,Cost-utility analysis of selective internal radiation therapy with Y-90 resin microspheres in hepatocellular carcinoma,"Background: The study assessed the cost-utility of selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with Y-90 resin microspheres versus sorafenib in UK patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ineligible for transarterial chemoembolization. Materials & methods: A lifetime partitioned survival model was developed for patients with low tumor burden (=25%) and good liver function (albumin-bilirubin grade 1). Efficacy, safety and quality of life data were from a European Phase III randomized controlled trial and published studies. Resource use was from registries and clinical surveys. Results: Discounted quality-adjusted life-years were 1.982 and 1.381, and discounted total costs were £29,143 and 30,927, for SIRT and sorafenib, respectively. Conclusion: SIRT has the potential to be a dominant (more efficacious/less costly) or cost-effective alternative to sorafenib in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.",2021-01-34148,33222542,Future Oncol,Noemi Muszbek,2021,17 / 9,1055-1068,No,33222542,"Noemi Muszbek; Edit Remak; Rachel Evans; Victoria K Brennan; Fabien Colaone; Suki Shergill; Damian Mullan; Paul J Ross; Cost-utility analysis of selective internal radiation therapy with Y-90 resin microspheres in hepatocellular carcinoma, Future Oncol, 2021 Mar; 17(9):1744-8301; 1055-1068",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",selective internal radiation therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- sorafenib,unresectable intermediate or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-2374.38,United Kingdom,2018,-3270.11
25425,Cost-effectiveness analysis of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in chronic hepatitis C patients with decompensated cirrhosis,"BACKGROUND: Current literature indicates that direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are cost-effective to treat compensated cirrhotic patients with hepatitis C. Although already funded by public payers, it is unknown whether it is economical to reimburse DAAs within the more advanced decompensated cirrhosis population. METHODS: A state-transition model was developed to conduct a cost-utility analysis of sofosbuvir-velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) plus ribavirin regimen for 12 weeks. The evaluated cohort had a mean age of 58 years and Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class B cirrhosis with decompensated symptoms. A scenario analysis was performed on CTP C patients. We used a payer perspective, a lifetime time horizon and a 1.5% annual discount rate. RESULTS: While SOF/VEL plus ribavirin treatment for 12 weeks increased costs by $156 676, it provided an extra 4.00 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to best supportive care (no DAA therapy). With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $39 169 per QALY, SOF/VEL plus ribavirin was determined to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY. SOF/VEL reduced liver-related deaths and reduced progression to CTP C cirrhosis by 20.4% and 21.9%, respectively. On the contrary, SOF/VEL regimen resulted in increases in liver transplants and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 54.0% and 42.5%, respectively. Similar results were found for CTP C patients. CONCLUSION: This analysis informs payers that SOF/VEL should continue to be reimbursed in decompensated hepatitis C patients. It also supports the recommendations by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases to continue screening for HCC in decompensated cirrhotic patients who have achieved sustained virologic response.",2021-01-34159,33065774,J Viral Hepat,Jocelyn Chan,2021,28 / 2,260-267,No,33065774,"Jocelyn Chan; John J Kim; Brett K Barrett; Abdullah Hamadeh; Jordan J Feld; William W L Wong; Praveen Thokala; Peter Dodd; Hassan Baalbaki; Alan Brennan; Simon Dixon; Kinga Lowrie; Cost-effectiveness analysis of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir in chronic hepatitis C patients with decompensated cirrhosis, J Viral Hepat, 2021 Feb; 28(2):1352-0504; 260-267",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,sofosbuvir/velpatasvir + ribavirin vs. Standard/Usual Care- best supportive care,decompensated cirrhosis,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,39169,Canada,2019,29881.84
25426,Cost-effectiveness of the reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. Does indication affect outcome?,"BACKGROUND: The primary aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of the reverse total shoulder arthroplasty in a prospective cohort of patients over a two-year post-operative period. METHODS: Patients who underwent reverse total shoulder arthroplasty were prospectively monitored for 24 months post-operatively using the Oxford Shoulder Score, Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire and EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire. Any complications or use of health care resources were recorded. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was used to express the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were analysed, 46 primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty for cuff arthropathy and 21 revisions from previous arthroplasty. Both indications had comparable peri-operative shoulder scores without significant difference. Using the mean change of EuroQol 5-dimensional questionnaire at one year, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated at £16,827.43 per quality-adjusted life year, decreasing to £8313.48 per quality-adjusted life year at two years. Primary was associated with a lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at two years (primary £7596.76 vs. revision £11,748.51). The estimated post-operative life expectancy of the cohort was 6.9 years with a projected cost per quality-adjusted life year of £2438.78.

25427,Cost-Effectiveness of Pembrolizumab plus Axitinib Versus Sunitinib as First-Line Therapy in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma in the U.S,"BACKGROUND: The data from the phase III clinical trial KEYNOTE-426 indicated that pembrolizumab plus axitinib compared with sunitinib could generate clinical benefits in patients with previously untreated advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Given the incremental clinical benefits, we examined the potential cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib in the first-line setting for patients with advanced RCC from the U.S. payers'' perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost and health outcomes were estimated at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 to $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying potentially modifiable parameters, and additional subgroup analyses were performed as well. RESULTS: Upon our analyses, the total treatment costs in the pembrolizumab plus axitinib and sunitinib groups were $522,796 and $348,424 and the QALYs gained 2.90 and 1.72, respectively. In the base-case analysis, compared with receiving sunitinib, patients with advanced RCC receiving pembrolizumab plus axitinib gained 1.18 more QALYs at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $148,676/QALY. The results of subgroup analyses demonstrated that pembrolizumab plus axitinib was most cost-effective for patients who had one organ with metastasis. CONCLUSION: First-line treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib, compared with sunitinib, is a cost-effective strategy when the value of WTP is from $100,000 to $150,000 per QALY in patients with advanced RCC. For patients with one-organ metastasis and those in International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium poor risk group, first-line treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib is more cost-effective than others. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This was the first study to examine the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus axitinib versus sunitinib in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study found that first-line treatment with pembrolizumab plus axitinib is a cost-effective strategy when the value of willingness-to-pay is from $100,000 to $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in patients with advanced RCC from the U.S. payers'' perspective.",2021-01-34185,32918790,Oncologist,Dong Ding,2021,26 / 2,e290-e297,No,32918790,"Dong Ding; Huabin Hu; Yin Shi; Longjiang She; Linli Yao; Youwen Zhu; Shan Zeng; Liangfang Shen; Jin Huang; Cost-Effectiveness of Pembrolizumab plus Axitinib Versus Sunitinib as First-Line Therapy in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma in the U.S, Oncologist, 2021 Feb; 26(2):1083-7159; e290-e297",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,pembrolizumab + axitinib vs. sunitinib,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,148676,United States,2019,150510.19

Adults aged 18 years or older with subthreshold depression were randomized into two arms and were followed up for 12 months. BAM group was provided with eight 2-h weekly treatment by trained allied healthcare workers. CAU group could access to usual medical care but did not receive extra interventions. The health service cost in the past 12 months was self-reported by the participants. Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and clinical outcome (incidence of major depressive disorder progression) were measured. Willingness-to-pay ratio for cost-utility analysis (CUA) and cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was US$50,000 per QALY and US$20,000 per prevented major depression case, respectively. These ratios were used in the cost-effective acceptability curve analyses to estimate the probability of cost-effectiveness of the estimated incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) of BAM versus CAU. A total of 115 and 116 participants were included in the BAM group and CAU respectively. The estimated CUA ICER was US5,979 per QALY and had a probability of 0.93 that BAM was cost-effective when compared to CAU. Furthermore, when compared to CAU, BAM was cost-effective in preventing progression of major depression: the estimated CEA ICER was US$1046 per preventable case of major progression with a probability of 0.99 to be cost-effective.

Pembrolizumab has shown substantial antitumor activity and a favorable toxicity profile as a second-line treatment of HCC. However, considering the high cost of pembrolizumab, there is a need to assess its value by considering both the clinical efficacy and cost. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab vs placebo as second-line therapy in patients with HCC from the US payer perspective. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A Markov model was developed to compare the lifetime cost and efficacy of pembrolizumab as a second-line treatment of HCC with those of placebo using outcome data from the KEYNOTE-240 randomized placebo-controlled trial, which included 413 patients with advanced HCC previously treated with sorafenib and randomized patients to receive pembrolizumab plus best supportive care or placebo plus best supportive care in a 2:1 ratio. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were estimated at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150?000 per QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the parameter of uncertainty. A cost-threshold analysis was also performed. The study was conducted from January 31 to July 29, 2020. RESULTS: The base-case model found that treatment with pembrolizumab was associated with increased overall cost by $47?057 and improved effectiveness by 0.138 QALYs compared with placebo, leading to an ICER of $340?409 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the hazard ratio of overall survival (range, 0.61-1.00), health utility of placebo (range, 0.59-0.93), price of pembrolizumab (range, $5531-$8297), and price of postprogression therapies (range, $5596-$7944 for pembrolizumab and $4770-$7156 for placebo). The ICER of pembrolizumab was larger than $150?000 per QALY in most of the sensitivity and subgroup analyses. The price of pembrolizumab needed to be reduced by 57.7% to $2925 per cycle to achieve cost-effectiveness.

The objective of this study was to assess the health impact and cost effectiveness of routine and catch-up vaccination of girls and women aged 11-26?years with a 4-valent (4vHPV) or 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine in Japan compared with no vaccination. METHODS: We used a mathematical model adapted to the population and healthcare settings in Japan. We compared no vaccination and routine vaccination of 12-16-year old girls with 1) 4vHPV vaccine, 2) 9vHPV vaccine, and 3) 9vHPV vaccine in addition to a temporary catch-up vaccination of 17-26?years old girls and women with 9vHPV. We estimated the expected number of disease cases and deaths, discounted (at 2% per year) future costs (in 2020 ¥) and discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) of each strategy over a time horizon of 100?years. To test the robustness of the conclusions, we conducted scenario and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Over 100?years, compared with no vaccination, 9vHPV vaccination was projected to reduce the incidence of 9vHPV-related cervical cancer by 86% (from 15.24 new cases per 100,000 women in 2021 to 2.02 in 2121). A greater number of cervical cancer cases (484,248) and cancer-related deaths (50,102) were avoided through the described catch-up vaccination program. Routine HPV vaccination with 4vHPV or 9vHPV vaccine prevented 5,521,000 cases of anogenital warts among women and men. Around 23,520 and 21,400 diagnosed non-cervical cancers are prevented by catch-up vaccination among women and men, respectively. Compared with no vaccination, the ICER of 4vHPV vaccination was ¥975,364/QALY. Compared to 4vHPV, 9vHPV?+?Catch-up had an ICER of ¥1,534,493/QALY.

25441,A Cost-Utility Analysis of Switching from Reference to Biosimilar Infliximab Compared to Maintaining Reference Infliximab in Adult Patients with Crohn's Disease,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lower-cost biosimilar infliximab may address affordability concerns in the treatment of adults with Crohn''s disease (CD), however, evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of switching from reference to biosimilar is warranted. The aim of this research was to assess the incremental cost of switching from treatment with reference infliximab to biosimilar compared with maintaining reference infliximab in adults with CD per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. METHODS: A probabilistic cohort Markov model with 8-week cycle lengths was constructed to estimate the incremental costs and effects of switching over a 5-year time horizon from a public payer perspective. Base-case clinical inputs were obtained from NOR-SWITCH subgroup analyses and other published trials. Costs were obtained from Canadian sources. A total of 10,000 simulations were run. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the results to variations in uncertain parameters. RESULTS: Switching to biosimilar infliximab was less costly but also less effective with incremental savings of $46,194 (95% confidence interval [CI]: $42,420, $50,455) and a loss in QALYs of -0.13 (95% CI: -0.16, -0.07). Eighty-three per cent of the simulations demonstrated incremental cost savings and an incremental loss of effectiveness. The model was sensitive to differences in rates of disease worsening between reference and biosimilar infliximab. CONCLUSIONS: While biosimilar infliximab is associated with incremental savings for patients on maintenance therapy who are switched from reference infliximab, funding decision makers must decide whether a small loss of effectiveness is justified.

25442,Evaluation of the Cost-effectiveness of Doublet Therapy in Metastatic BRAF Variant Colorectal Cancer,"IMPORTANCE: The BEACON trial showed that combination therapy with encorafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and cetuximab (EGFR inhibitor) was associated with prolonged overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with metastatic BRAF variant colorectal cancer. However, the cost-effectiveness of using these agents in this clinical setting is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To create a cost-effectiveness model to compare doublet therapy (encorafenib plus cetuximab) with standard chemotherapy (cetuximab plus irinotecan or cetuximab plus folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan) in treating patients with metastatic BRAF variant colorectal cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation constructed a Markov model to compare the lifetime cost and utility of doublet therapy and standard chemotherapy. Parametric survival modeling was used to extrapolate the effectiveness of each line of therapy from large clinical trials. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the uncertainty in the model. Patients mirrored the cohorts in the BEACON trial: they had metastatic BRAF variant colorectal cancer and were followed up as they progressed through multiple lines of therapy, best supportive care, and death. Data collection and data analysis were performed from November 15, 2019, to July 14, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which was calculated using the cumulative cost and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), of doublet therapy compared with standard chemotherapy. RESULTS: The model patient cohort had a mean age of 61 years, and 53% of the patients were women, 66% had 1 previous line of therapy, and 8% had high microsatellite instability. Doublet therapy was associated with an improvement of 0.15 QALYs compared with standard chemotherapy. However, the incremental cost of doublet therapy was $78?233, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $523?374 per QALY gained. Concomitant decreases in the price of encorafenib and cetuximab are needed to achieve cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150?000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that doublet therapy for metastatic BRAF variant colorectal cancer was unlikely to be cost-effective under current pricing.

Cost effectiveness, from the healthcare sector perspective, of the Tips From Former Smokers® campaign was compared over 2012-2018 with that of no campaign. METHODS: A combination of survey data from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults that includes cigarette smokers and literature-based lifetime relapse rates were used to calculate the cumulative number of Tips From Former Smokers® campaign?associated lifetime quits during 2012-2018. Then, lifetime health benefits (premature deaths averted, life years saved, and quality-adjusted life years gained) and healthcare sector cost savings associated with these quits were assessed. All the costs were adjusted for inflation in 2018 U.S. dollars. The Tips From Former Smokers® campaign was conducted and the survey data were collected during 2012-2018. Analyses were conducted in 2019. RESULTS: During 2012-2018, the Tips From Former Smokers® campaign was associated with an estimated 129,100 premature deaths avoided, 803,800 life years gained, 1.38 million quality-adjusted life years gained, and $7.3 billion in healthcare sector cost savings on the basis of an estimated 642,200 campaign-associated lifetime quits. The Tips From Former Smokers® campaign was associated with cost savings per lifetime quit of $11,400, per life year gained of $9,100, per premature deaths avoided of $56,800, and per quality-adjusted life year gained of $5,300.

25444,The cost-effectiveness of different approaches to exercise and corticosteroid injection for subacromial pain (impingement) syndrome,"OBJECTIVES: To determine whether physiotherapist-led exercise intervention and ultrasound-guided subacromial corticosteroid injection is cost-effective when compared with standard advice and exercise leaflet and unguided injection in patients with subacromial pain (impingement) syndrome. METHODS: An incremental cost-utility analysis using patient responses to the five-level EuroQoL-5D (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire was undertaken from a health care perspective alongside a 2x2 factorial randomised trial with 256 participants over a 12-month follow-up period. Uncertainty was explored through the use of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: The cost-utility analysis indicated that physiotherapist-led exercise was associated with an incremental cost of £155.99 (95% CI: 69.02-241.93) and 0.031 (95% CI: -0.01-0.07) additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £5,031 per QALY gained and an 85% chance of being cost-effective at a threshold of £20?000 per QALY gained compared with the advice and exercise leaflet. Ultrasound-guided injection was associated with an incremental cost of £15.89 (95% CI: -59.36-109.86) and 0.024 (95% CI: -0.02-0.07) additional QALYs, an ICER of £662 per QALY gained and a 83% chance of being cost-effective at a threshold of £20?000 per QALY gained compared with unguided injection.

25446,Cost-effectiveness of Prostate Radiation Therapy for Men With Newly Diagnosed Low-Burden Metastatic Prostate Cancer,"IMPORTANCE: Prostate radiation therapy (PRT) is a treatment option in men with low-volume metastatic prostate cancer based on the results of the Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy Arm H (STAMPEDE-H) trial. However, the cost-effectiveness of this treatment remains unaddressed. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of PRT when added to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for men with low-volume metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation used microsimulation modeling to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding PRT to ADT. A simulated cohort of 10 000 individuals with low-volume mHSPC was created. Data from men with low-volume mHSPC were extracted and analyzed from January 18, 2019, through July 4, 2020. Transition probabilities were extracted from the STAMPEDE-H study. Health states included stable disease, progression, second progression, and death. Individual grade 2 or higher genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxic events associated with PRT were tracked. Univariable deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty with regard to the model assumptions. Health state utility estimates were based on the published literature. EXPOSURES: The combination of PRT and ADT using regimens of 20 fractions and 6 weekly fractions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included net quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs in US dollars, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A strategy was classified as dominant if it was associated with higher QALYs at lower costs than the alternative and dominated if it was associated with fewer QALYs at higher costs than the alternative. RESULTS: For the base case scenario of men 68 years of age with low-volume mHSPC, the modeled outcomes were similar to the target clinical data for overall survival, failure-free survival, and rates of PRT-related toxic effects. The addition of PRT was a dominant strategy compared with ADT alone, with a gain of 0.16 QALYs (95% CI, 0.15-0.17 QALYs) and a reduction in net costs by $19?472 (95% CI, $23?096-$37?362) at 37 months of follow-up and a gain of 0.81 QALYs (95% CI, 0.73-0.89 QALYs) and savings of $30?229 (95% CI, $23?096-$37?362) with lifetime follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In the economic evaluation, PRT was a dominant treatment strategy compared with ADT alone. These findings suggest that addition of PRT to ADT is a cost-effective treatment for men with low-volume mHSPC.",2021-01-34276,33439266,JAMA Netw Open,Nataniel H Lester-Coll,2021,4 / 1,e2033787,No,33439266,"Nataniel H Lester-Coll; Steven Ades; James B Yu; Adam Atherly; H James 3rd Wallace; Brian L Sprague; Cost-effectiveness of Prostate Radiation Therapy for Men With Newly Diagnosed Low-Burden Metastatic Prostate Cancer, JAMA Netw Open, 2021 Jan 4; 4(1):2574-3805; e2033787",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,androgen deprivation therapy + prostate radiation therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- androgen deprivation therapy,Not Stated,68 Years,68 Years,Male,Full,"37 Months, Lifetime",3.00,3.00,-121700,United States,2020,-121700
25447,Cost-effectiveness of romosozumab for the treatment of postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis at high risk of fracture in Sweden,"Romosozumab is a novel bone-building drug that reduces fracture risk. This health economic analysis indicates that sequential romosozumab-to-alendronate can be a cost-effective treatment option for postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequential treatment with romosozumab followed by alendronate (""romosozumab-to-alendronate"") compared with alendronate alone in patients with severe osteoporosis at high risk of fracture in Sweden. METHODS: A microsimulation model with a Markov structure was used to simulate fractures, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), for women treated with romosozumab-to-alendronate or alendronate alone. Patients aged 74 years with a recent major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) were followed from the start of treatment until the age of 100 years or death. Treatment with romosozumab for 12 months was followed by alendronate for up to 48 months or alendronate alone with a maximum treatment duration of 60 months. The analysis had a societal perspective. Efficacy of romosozumab and alendronate were derived from phase III randomized controlled trials. Resource use and unit costs were collected from the literature. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with QALYs as effectiveness measures. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that sequential romosozumab-to-alendronate treatment was associated with 0.089 additional QALYs at an additional cost of €3002 compared to alendronate alone, resulting in an ICER of €33,732. At a Swedish reference willingness-to-pay per QALY of €60,000, romosozumab-to-alendronate had a 97.9% probability of being cost-effective against alendronate alone. The results were most sensitive to time horizon, persistence assumptions, patient age, and treatment efficacy.

25448,Cost-effectiveness of topical glycopyrronium tosylate for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis,"AIMS: Primary axillary hyperhidrosis (PAHH) is a condition characterized by excessive sweating that negatively impacts health-related quality of life, with significant psychological and social impacts. Glycopyrronium tosylate (GT) is a topical anticholinergic approved in the United States for treatment of PAHH in patients 9?years of age and older. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of GT as first-line topical therapy compared to topical aluminum chloride from a United States commercial perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed consisting of four health states based on the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) over a time horizon of 5 years with discount rates of 3% for both costs and outcomes. Transitions between health states were driven by HDSS response, defined as an improvement of =2 points. Non-responders and those who discontinue could switch to later line treatments or no treatment. Health utility scores were based on HDSS scores, supported by published literature. RESULTS: Over 5 years, GT yielded 0.12 greater QALYs and 0.93 greater LYs with response compared to treatment with prescription aluminum chloride at an incremental cost of $10,584. Relative to prescription aluminum chloride, GT resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $87,238 per QALY gained, $11,349 per LY with response. The ICER fell below $100,000 for 66% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis simulations and below $150,000 for 82% of simulations. LIMITATIONS: This analysis represents a simplified scenario of a hypothetical PAHH patient. Due to sparse data, assumptions were required for treatment patterns, efficacy, and persistence.

METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial, a randomized, multicenter, international clinical trial with a parallel nonoperative casted group of patients older than 60 years with surgically indicated, extraarticular closed distal radius fractures. Thirty-Six-Item Short-Form Health Survey-converted utilities and total costs from Medicare were used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Casted patients were self-selected and older (p < 0.001) than the randomized surgical cohorts, but otherwise similar in sociodemographic characteristics. Quality-adjusted life-years for percutaneous pinning were highest at 9.17 and external fixation lowest at 8.81. Total costs expended were $16,354 for volar locking plates, $16,012 for external fixation, $11,329 for percutaneous pinning, and $6837 for casting. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for volar locking plates and external fixation were dominated by percutaneous pinning and casting.

25454,Cost-Effectiveness of Treatments after Closed Extraarticular Distal Radius Fractures in Older Adults from the WRIST Clinical Trial,"BACKGROUND: This study performs an economic analysis of volar locking plate, external fixation, percutaneous pinning, or casting in elderly patients with closed distal radius fractures. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of the Wrist and Radius Injury Surgical Trial, a randomized, multicenter, international clinical trial with a parallel nonoperative casted group of patients older than 60 years with surgically indicated, extraarticular closed distal radius fractures. Thirty-Six-Item Short-Form Health Survey-converted utilities and total costs from Medicare were used to calculate quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Casted patients were self-selected and older (p < 0.001) than the randomized surgical cohorts, but otherwise similar in sociodemographic characteristics. Quality-adjusted life-years for percutaneous pinning were highest at 9.17 and external fixation lowest at 8.81. Total costs expended were $16,354 for volar locking plates, $16,012 for external fixation, $11,329 for percutaneous pinning, and $6837 for casting. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for volar locking plates and external fixation were dominated by percutaneous pinning and casting. The ratio for percutaneous pinning compared to casting was $28,717. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed a 10, 5, 53, and 32 percent chance of volar locking plate, external fixation, percutaneous pinning, and casting, respectively, being cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

25455,Cost-Effectiveness of Dual Bronchodilator Indacaterol/Glycopyrronium for COPD Treatment in China,"BACKGROUND: Indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) is a once-daily dual bronchodilator for long-term treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The efficacy and safety of IND/GLY have been proved before, but the cost-effectiveness is unknown in China. PURPOSE: This study assessed cost-effectiveness of IND/GLY comparing with salmeterol/fluticasone (SAL/FLU) and tiotropium. METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was established from Chinese payer perspective. Patient parameters were randomly simulated through resampling from parameter distributions based on clinical trials and China-specific cost data to represent individual level health state and health state transitions in the model. We simulated patient-level health state, costs, life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of whole life horizon to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of IND/GLY comparing with SAL/FLU and tiotropium respectively. RESULTS: Comparing with SAL/FLU, IND/GLY resulted in 0.384 LYs and 0.255 QALYs gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is -35,822 CNY/LY and the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) is -53,834 CNY/QALY for IND/GLY versus SAL/FLU. Comparing with tiotropium, IND/GLY resulted in 0.232 LYs and 0.146 QALYs gained. The ICER is 39,729 CNY/LY and the ICUR is 63,246 CNY/QALY for IND/GLY versus tiotropium.

Methods: A three-state Markov model was developed from the perspective of US payers to simulate the disease development of patient''s life time for daratumumab plus bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (D-VMP) and bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone (VMP) regimens. The primary outputs were total costs, expected life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: The base case results showed that adding daratumumab to VMP provided an additional 3.00 Lys or 2.03 QALYs, at a cost of $262,526 per LY or $388,364 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were most sensitive to utility of progression disease of D-VMP regimens, but no matter how these parameters changed, ICERs remained higher than $150,000 per QALY.

25461,Endoscopy Is Cost-Effective for Gastric Cancer Screening After Successful Helicobacter pylori Eradication,"BACKGROUND: After successful Helicobacter pylori eradication, patients with gastric mucosal atrophy are at high risk of gastric cancer. Endoscopy can detect early gastric cancer with high sensitivity. AIMS: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of annual endoscopy versus biennial endoscopy versus no screening for gastric cancer screening in patients after successful Helicobacter pylori eradication. METHODS: We developed decision trees with Markov models for a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 50 years after successful Helicobacter pylori eradication over a lifetime horizon from a healthcare payer perspective. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life expectancy life-years (LYs) with discounting at a fixed annual rate of 3%, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, biennial endoscopy (US$4305, 19.785QALYs, 19.938LYs) was more cost-effective than annual endoscopy (US$7516, 19.808QALYs, 19.958LYs, ICER; US$135,566/QALY gained) and no screening (US$14,326, 19.704QALYs, 19.873LYs).

25463,Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy is critical and cost-effective in increasing life expectancy and quality of life in patients suffering from Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders (CVID): A health-economic assessment,"BACKGROUND: Common variable immunodeficiency disorders (CVID), the most common form of primary antibody deficiency, are rare conditions associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The clinical benefit of immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgGRT) is substantial: timely treatment with appropriate doses significantly reduces mortality and the incidence of CVID-complications such as major infections and bronchiectasis. Unfortunately, CVID-patients still face a median diagnostic delay of 4 years. Their disease burden, expressed in annual loss of disability-adjusted life years, is 3-fold higher than in the general population. Hurdles to treatment access and reimbursement by healthcare payers may exist because the value of IgGRT is poorly documented. This paper aims to demonstrate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility (on life expectancy and quality) of IgGRT in CVID. METHODS AND FINDINGS: With input from a literature search, we built a health-economic model for cost-effectiveness and cost-utility assessment of IgGRT in CVID. We compared a mean literature-based dose (=450mg/kg/4wks) to a zero-or-low dose (0 to =100 mg/kg/4wks) in a simulated cohort of adult patients from time of diagnosis until death; we also estimated the economic impact of diagnostic delay in this simulated cohort. Compared to no or minimal treatment, IgGRT showed an incremental benefit of 17 life-years (LYs) and 11 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €29,296/LY and €46,717/QALY. These results were robust in a sensitivity analysis. Reducing diagnostic delay by 4 years provided an incremental benefit of six LYs and four QALYs compared to simulated patients with delayed IgGRT initiation, resulting in an ICER of €30,374/LY and €47,495/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The health-economic model suggests that early initiation of IgGRT compared to no or delayed IgGRT is highly cost-effective. CVID-patients'' access to IgGRT should be facilitated, not only because of proven clinical efficacy, but also due to the now demonstrated cost-effectiveness.",2021-01-34289,33661975,PLoS One,Philippe van Wilder,2021,16 / 3,e0247941,No,33661975,"Philippe van Wilder; Irina Odnoletkova; Mehdi Mouline; Esther de Vries; Immunoglobulin Replacement Therapy is critical and cost-effective in increasing life expectancy and quality of life in patients suffering from Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorders (CVID): A health-economic assessment, PLoS One , 2021; 16(3):1932-6203; e0247941",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,immunoglobulin replacement therapy vs. immunoglobulin replacement therapy (0 to100 mg/kg/4wks),Not Stated,30 Years,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,3.00,1.50,46717,Euro,2019,52974.64
25464,Cost-effectiveness analysis of fruquintinib versus regorafenib as the third-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer in China,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of fruquintinib compared to regorafenib as third-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in China. METHODS: A three-state Markov model with monthly cycle was constructed to estimate lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of fruquintinib versus regorafenib as third-line treatment for patients with mCRC from Chinese health care perspective. Survival analysis was applied to calculate transition probabilities using the data from the clinical trials FRESCO and CONCUR, which were also the data sources accessing probabilities of adverse events. Background mortality rate and drug costs were derived from government published data. Costs for medical services were obtained from real-world data and published literatures. Utilities applied to calculate the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained from literature review. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were adopted to verify the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Fruquintinib provided 0.74 QALYs at a cost of CNY 151,058 (USD 22,888), whereas regorafenib provided 0.79 QALYs at a cost of CNY 226,657 (USD 32,224). Compared to fruquintinib, the ICER of regorafenib was CNY 1,529,197/QALY (USD 231,697/QALY) from Chinese health care perspective, which was above the triple GDP per capita of China in 2019 (CNY 212,676) (USD 32,224) as the threshold to define the cost-effectiveness. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the results were generally robust. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves derived from probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated the probability that fruquintinib was more cost-effective was 100% when the threshold was the triple GDP per capita of China. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to regorafenib, fruquintinib, which leads to forego about 0.05 QALYs and save about CNY 75,599 (USD 11,454), is a cost-effective choice as the third-line treatment for patients with mCRC in China.",2021-01-34291,33571036,J Med Econ,Xin Guan,2021,24 / 1,339-344,Yes,33571036,"Xin Guan; Hongchao Li; Xiaomo Xiong; Cike Peng; Ning Wang; Xiao Ma; Aixia Ma; Cost-effectiveness analysis of fruquintinib versus regorafenib as the third-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer in China, J Med Econ, 2021 Jan-Dec; 24(1):1369-6998; 339-344",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,regorafenib vs. fruquintinib,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,1511980,China,2020,218995.18

To prioritize the vaccine under constrained supply, the population was divided into tiers based on age; risk and age; and occupation and age; and outcomes were compared across one year under various supply assumptions. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus no vaccine was calculated for the entire adult population and for each tier in the three prioritization schemes. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained for the US adult population was $8,200 versus no vaccination. For the tiers at highest risk of complications from COVID-19, such as those ages 65 years and older, vaccination was cost-saving compared to no vaccination. The cost per QALY gained increased to over $94,000 for those with a low risk of hospitalization and death following infection. Results were most sensitive to infection incidence, vaccine price, the cost of treating COVID-19, and vaccine efficacy. Under the most optimistic supply scenario, the hypothetical vaccine may prevent 31% of expected deaths. As supply becomes more constrained, only 23% of deaths may be prevented. In lower supply scenarios, prioritization becomes more important to maximize the number of deaths prevented. CONCLUSIONS: A COVID-19 vaccine is predicted to be good value for money (cost per QALY gained <$50,000).

25472,Cost-effectiveness of a Telemonitoring Program for Patients With Heart Failure During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong Kong: Model Development and Data Analysis,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused patients to avoid seeking medical care. Provision of telemonitoring programs in addition to usual care has demonstrated improved effectiveness in managing patients with heart failure (HF). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the potential clinical and health economic outcomes of a telemonitoring program for management of patients with HF during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare the outcomes of a care under COVID-19 (CUC) group and a telemonitoring plus CUC group (telemonitoring group) in a hypothetical cohort of older patients with HF in Hong Kong. The model outcome measures were direct medical cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the model assumptions and the robustness of the base-case results. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the telemonitoring group showed a higher QALY gain (1.9007) at a higher cost (US $15,888) compared to the CUC group (1.8345 QALYs at US $15,603). Adopting US $48,937/QALY (1 × the gross domestic product per capita of Hong Kong) as the willingness-to-pay threshold, telemonitoring was accepted as a highly cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effective ratio of US $4292/QALY. No threshold value was identified in the deterministic sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, telemonitoring was accepted as cost-effective in 99.22% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the current outpatient care alone under the COVID-19 pandemic, the addition of telemonitoring-mediated management to the current care for patients with HF appears to be a highly cost-effective strategy from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong.",2021-01-34293,33656440,J Med Internet Res,Xinchan Jiang,2021,23 / 3,e26516,No,33656440,"Xinchan Jiang; Jiaqi Yao; Joyce Hoi-Sze You; Cost-effectiveness of a Telemonitoring Program for Patients With Heart Failure During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Hong Kong: Model Development and Data Analysis, J Med Internet Res, 2021 Mar 3; 23(3):1438-8871; e26516",QALY,China,Not Stated,Care Delivery,telemonitoring + current care under covid-19 group vs. Standard/Usual Care- current care under COVID-19,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,4292,United States,2020,4292

INTRODUCTION: To assess the cost-effectiveness of buffered soluble alendronate (ALN) 70 mg effervescent tablet compared with relevant alternative treatments for postmenopausal osteoporotic women in Italy. METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was adjusted to the Italian healthcare setting to estimate the lifetime costs (expressed in €2019) per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of buffered soluble ALN compared with generic ALN, denosumab, zoledronic acid and no treatment. Pooled efficacy data derived from the NICE network meta-analysis were used for bisphosphonate treatments. Two treatment duration scenarios were assessed: 1 year using persistence data derived from an Italian prospective observational study including 144 and 216 postmenopausal osteoporotic women on buffered soluble ALN and oral ALN, respectively, and 3 years. Analyses were conducted for women 60-80 years of age with a bone mineral density T-score = - 3.0 or with existing vertebral fractures. RESULTS: In all simulated populations, buffered soluble ALN was dominant (more QALYs, lower costs) compared to denosumab. The cost per QALY gained of buffered soluble ALN compared to generic ALN and no treatment always falls below €20,000 per QALY gained. In the 1-year treatment scenario, zoledronic acid was associated with more QALY than buffered soluble ALN but the cost per QALY gained of zoledronic acid compared with buffered soluble ALN was always higher than €70,000, while buffered soluble ALN was dominant in the 3-year treatment scenario.

INTRODUCTION: To assess the cost-effectiveness of buffered soluble alendronate (ALN) 70 mg effervescent tablet compared with relevant alternative treatments for postmenopausal osteoporotic women in Italy. METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was adjusted to the Italian healthcare setting to estimate the lifetime costs (expressed in €2019) per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of buffered soluble ALN compared with generic ALN, denosumab, zoledronic acid and no treatment. Pooled efficacy data derived from the NICE network meta-analysis were used for bisphosphonate treatments.

Analyses were conducted for women 60-80 years of age with a bone mineral density T-score = - 3.0 or with existing vertebral fractures. RESULTS: In all simulated populations, buffered soluble ALN was dominant (more QALYs, lower costs) compared to denosumab.

25488,Cost-effectiveness of buffered soluble alendronate 70 mg effervescent tablet for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Italy,"The use of buffered soluble alendronate 70 mg effervescent tablet, a convenient dosing regimen for bisphosphonate therapy, seems a cost-effective strategy compared with relevant alternative treatments for postmenopausal women with osteoporosis aged 60 years and over in Italy. INTRODUCTION: To assess the cost-effectiveness of buffered soluble alendronate (ALN) 70 mg effervescent tablet compared with relevant alternative treatments for postmenopausal osteoporotic women in Italy. METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was adjusted to the Italian healthcare setting to estimate the lifetime costs (expressed in €2019) per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of buffered soluble ALN compared with generic ALN, denosumab, zoledronic acid and no treatment. Pooled efficacy data derived from the NICE network meta-analysis were used for bisphosphonate treatments. Two treatment duration scenarios were assessed: 1 year using persistence data derived from an Italian prospective observational study including 144 and 216 postmenopausal osteoporotic women on buffered soluble ALN and oral ALN, respectively, and 3 years. Analyses were conducted for women 60-80 years of age with a bone mineral density T-score = - 3.0 or with existing vertebral fractures. RESULTS: In all simulated populations, buffered soluble ALN was dominant (more QALYs, lower costs) compared to denosumab. The cost per QALY gained of buffered soluble ALN compared to generic ALN and no treatment always falls below €20,000 per QALY gained. In the 1-year treatment scenario, zoledronic acid was associated with more QALY than buffered soluble ALN but the cost per QALY gained of zoledronic acid compared with buffered soluble ALN was always higher than €70,000, while buffered soluble ALN was dominant in the 3-year treatment scenario.

Two randomized clinical trials recently demonstrated that clip closure after EMR of large nonpedunculated colorectal polyps (LNPCPs) reduces the risk of DB. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of this prophylactic measure. METHODS: EMRs of LNCPCPs were consecutively registered in the ongoing prospective multicenter database of the Spanish EMR Group from May 2013 until July 2017. Patients were classified according to the Spanish Endoscopy Society EMR group (GSEED-RE2) DB risk score. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for both Spanish and US economic contexts.

25493,Cost-utility analysis of treatment options after initial tumor necrosis factor inhibitor therapy discontinuation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"BACKGROUND: For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who discontinued initial treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), 2 approaches are commonly used: cycling to another TNFi or switching to a drug with another mechanism of action. Currently, there is no consensus on which approach to use first. A report from the IBM MarketScan Research administrative claims database showed adalimumab (cycling strategy) and abatacept (switching strategy) were more commonly prescribed after the first TNFi discontinuation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of adalimumab versus abatacept in patients with RA whose initial TNFi therapy failed. METHODS: A probabilistic cost-utility microsimulation state-transition model was used. Our target population was commercially insured adults with RA, the time horizon was 10 years, and we used a payer perspective. Patients not responding to adalimumab or abatacept were moved to the next drug in a sequence of 3 and, finally, to conventional synthetic therapy. Incremental cost-utility ratios (2016 USD per quality-adjusted-life-year gained [QALY)] were calculated. Utilities were derived from a formula based on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index and age-adjusted comorbidity score. RESULTS: Switching to abatacept after the first TNFi showed an incremental cost of just more than $11,300 over 10 years and achieved a QALY benefit of 0.16 compared with adalimumab. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $68,950 per QALY. Scenario analysis produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio range of $44,573 per QALY to $148,558 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that switching to abatacept after TNFi therapy failure had an 80.6% likelihood of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Switching to abatacept is a cost-effective strategy for patients with RA whose discontinue initial therapy with TNFi.

The aim of this study is to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of THA and TKA in the New Zealand (NZ) healthcare system. METHODS: Data were collected from 713 patients undergoing THA and 520 patients undergoing TKA at our local public hospital. SF-6D utility values were obtained from participants preoperatively and 1-year postoperatively, and deaths and any revision surgeries from patient records and the New Zealand Joint Registry at minimum 8-year follow-up. A continuous-time state-transition simulation model was used to estimate costs and health gains to 15 years. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), treatment costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to determine cost effectiveness.

25496,Cost-effectiveness of meningococcal vaccination of Norwegian teenagers with a quadrivalent ACWY conjugate vaccine,"In Norway, the incidence of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is higher among 16-19-year-olds than in the general population. Most IMD cases among teenagers are caused by serogroup Y. Since 2011, one dose of meningococcal ACWY conjugate vaccine (MCV4) has been recommended for teenagers with out-of-pocket payment. The teenagers are usually vaccinated through the school health service at age 18. This study aimed to estimate costs and health gains of introducing MCV4 to Norwegian teenagers through the national immunization program (NIP). A Markov model was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of universal MCV4 vaccination of either 15-year-olds or 18-years-olds. Occurrences of IMD were simulated from 15 until 23 years of age. Costs were estimated from a healthcare perspective. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of vaccine price, vaccination uptake, IMD incidence and discount rate. Compared to today''s practice of vaccinating 18-year-olds with out-of-pocket payment, introducing MCV4 to 15-year-olds in a NIP-setting, with 90% vaccine uptake and 50% rebate on vaccine price, prevented 3.2 hospitalizations, 0.20 sequelae and 0.47 deaths among 15-23-year-olds, annually.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus other available treatments for patients with moderate to severe UC following an inadequate response to conventional treatment and who are either naïve to or have failed previous biologics in Germany. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the differences in long-term costs and outcomes between tofacitinib and its comparators from the perspective of German statutory health insurance (SHI) for patients either naïve or exposed to biologics. Tofacitinib was compared to infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, adalimumab, adalimumab biosimilar, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and conventional therapy. Health states modeled were remission, treatment response, active UC, and post-colectomy. Patients not responding to treatment could switch to a different treatment. Treatment efficacy for induction and maintenance phases were assessed by a systematic literature review (SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA). The model included costs associated with drug administration, adverse events, and medical resource use. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) were conducted. RESULTS: Over a life-time horizon, patients treated with tofacitinib gained 0.035-0.083 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and had direct cost savings to the SHI of €4,228-€17,184 compared to biologic treatments other than adalimumab biosimilar. When compared to adalimumab biosimilar, treatment with tofacitinib resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €17,497 per QALY gained and can be considered a cost-effective alternative. Compared with conventional therapy, tofacitinib resulted in a lower ICER than all other biologics. The DSA showed that the model results were most influenced by differences in treatment efficacy. The PSA suggested confidence in the base-case results considering uncertainty around parameters.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus other available treatments for patients with moderate to severe UC following an inadequate response to conventional treatment and who are either naïve to or have failed previous biologics in Germany. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the differences in long-term costs and outcomes between tofacitinib and its comparators from the perspective of German statutory health insurance (SHI) for patients either naïve or exposed to biologics. Tofacitinib was compared to infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, adalimumab, adalimumab biosimilar, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and conventional therapy.
