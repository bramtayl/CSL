13301,Cost-utility analysis of gastric bypass for severely obese patients in Spain,"BACKGROUND: To assess the cost-utility of gastric bypass versus usual care for patients with severe obesity in Spain. METHODS: We have implemented a discrete-event simulation model with two branches: one branch involves gastric bypass, thereby reducing patients' BMI, and another branch where patients do not undergo surgery. The model analyzes the emergence of comorbidities (stroke, coronary obstructive disease, diabetes, and breast cancer) associated with obesity during a lifetime horizon. The selected measure of effectiveness is health-related quality of life. Both costs and effects are discounted at 3 %. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis is also performed using second-order Monte Carlo simulation; acceptability curves for different time horizons were also calculated. RESULTS: Patients with gastric bypass result in a lifetime increase of 5.63 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (18.18 vs. 12.55 QALYs). In addition, because of the reduced spending associated with the treatment of various obesity-related comorbidities, final savings stand at 13,994 <euro>. The total cost of the intervention branch is close to half the cost of the non-intervention branch (17,431 vs. 31,425 <euro>). CONCLUSIONS: Gastric bypass is an intervention that dominates over the option of not intervening when a lifetime horizon is considered.",2014-01-16396,24913241,Obes Surg,Ivan Castilla,2014,24 / 12,2061-8,No,24913241,"Ivan Castilla; Javier Mar; Cristina Valcarcel-Nazco; Arantzazu Arrospide; Juan M Ramos-Goni; Cost-utility analysis of gastric bypass for severely obese patients in Spain, Obes Surg, ; 24(12):0960-8923; 2061-8",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Gastric Bypass vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,55 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-2485.53,Euro,2012,-3602.8
13302,Cost utility analysis of a collaborative stepped care intervention for panic and generalized anxiety disorders in primary care,"OBJECTIVE: Generalized anxiety and panic disorders are a burden on the society because they are costly and have a significant adverse effect on quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of a collaborative stepped care intervention for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder in primary care compared to care as usual from a societal perspective. METHODS: The design of the study was a two armed cluster randomized controlled trial. In total 43 primary care practices in the Netherlands participated in the study. Eventually, 180 patients were included (114 collaborative stepped care, 66 care as usual). Baseline measures and follow-up measures (3, 6, 9 and 12 months) were assessed using questionnaires. We applied the TiC-P, the SF-HQL and the EQ-5D respectively measuring health care utilization, production losses and health related quality of life. RESULTS: The average annual direct medical costs in the collaborative stepped care group were 1854 Euro (95% C.I., 1726 to 1986) compared to euro1503 (95% C.I., 1374 to 1664) in the care as usual group. The average quality of life years (QALYs) gained was 0.05 higher in the collaborative stepped care group, leading to an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 6965 Euro per QALY. Inclusion of the productivity costs, consequently reflecting the full societal costs, decreased the ratio even more. CONCLUSION: The study showed that collaborative stepped care was a cost effective intervention for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder and was even dominant when a societal perspective was taken.

13303,A cost-effectiveness analysis of celecoxib compared with diclofenac in the treatment of pain in osteoarthritis (OA) within the Swedish health system using an adaptation of the NICE OA model,"OBJECTIVES: Celecoxib for the treatment of pain resulting from osteoarthritis (OA) was reviewed by the Tandvards- och lakemedelsformansverket-Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Board (TLV) in Sweden in late 2010. This study aimed to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of celecoxib plus a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) compared to diclofenac plus a PPI in a Swedish setting. METHODS: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK developed a health economic model as part of their 2008 assessment of treatments for OA. In this analysis, the model was reconstructed and adapted to a Swedish perspective. Drug costs were updated using the TLV database. Adverse event costs were calculated using the regional price list of Southern Sweden and the standard treatment guidelines from the county council of Stockholm. Costs for treating cardiovascular (CV) events were taken from the Swedish DRG codes and the literature. RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime treatment with celecoxib plus a PPI was associated with a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.006 per patient when compared to diclofenac plus a PPI. There was an increase in discounted costs of 529 kr per patient, which resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 82,313 kr ($12,141). Sensitivity analysis showed that treatment was more cost effective in patients with an increased risk of bleeding or gastrointestinal (GI) complications. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that celecoxib plus a PPI is a cost effective treatment for OA when compared to diclofenac plus a PPI.

DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed for alternative strategies of ensuring hepatitis B protection under assumptions of 68% and 95% long-term protection after a primary vaccination series. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost from infections were estimated, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated relative to a no intervention alternative over 10 years of intervention. Separate analyses were performed for trainees and nontrainees, using the healthcare system perspective. Trainees face higher risk of exposure and likely received primary vaccination as infants. SETTING: General healthcare settings. PARTICIPANTS: Trainee and nontrainee HCP. INTERVENTIONS: Preexposure testing for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen followed by additional vaccination for HCP without protective antibody levels; postexposure evaluation and management for HCP reporting blood or body fluid exposures RESULTS: The preexposure strategy prevents more infections and has higher costs than the postexposure strategy or no intervention. For trainees, 10-year preexposure evaluation ICERs are $832,875 and $144,457 per QALY for 95% and 68% long-term vaccine protection, respectively.

DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed for alternative strategies of ensuring hepatitis B protection under assumptions of 68% and 95% long-term protection after a primary vaccination series. Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost from infections were estimated, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated relative to a no intervention alternative over 10 years of intervention. Separate analyses were performed for trainees and nontrainees, using the healthcare system perspective. Trainees face higher risk of exposure and likely received primary vaccination as infants. SETTING: General healthcare settings. PARTICIPANTS: Trainee and nontrainee HCP. INTERVENTIONS: Preexposure testing for antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen followed by additional vaccination for HCP without protective antibody levels; postexposure evaluation and management for HCP reporting blood or body fluid exposures RESULTS: The preexposure strategy prevents more infections and has higher costs than the postexposure strategy or no intervention.

13315,Cost-effectiveness of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus observation in older patients presenting with mild biliary disease,"Our objective was to determine the probability threshold for recurrent symptoms at which elective cholecystectomy compared to observation in older patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis is the more effective and cost-effective option. We built a decision model of elective cholecystectomy versus observation in patients >65 presenting with initial episodes of symptomatic cholelithiasis that did not require initial hospitalization or cholecystectomy. Probabilities for subsequent hospitalization, emergency cholecystectomy, and perioperative complications were based on previously published probabilities from a 5 % national sample of Medicare patients. Costs were estimated from Medicare reimbursements and from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. Utilities (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were obtained from established literature estimates. Elective cholecystectomy compared to observation in all patients was associated with lower effectiveness (-0.10 QALYs) and had an increased cost of $3,422.83 per patient at 2-year follow-up. Elective cholecystectomy became the more effective option when the likelihood for continued symptoms exceeded 45.3 %. Elective cholecystectomy was both more effective and less costly when the probability for continued symptoms exceeded 82.7 %. An individualized shared decision-making strategy based on these data can increase elective cholecystectomy rates in patients at high risk for recurrent symptoms and minimize unnecessary cholecystectomy for patients unlikely to benefit.",2014-01-16411,24919433,J Gastrointest Surg,Abhishek D Parmar,2014,18 / 9,1616-22,No,24919433,"Abhishek D Parmar; Mark D Coutin; Gabriela M Vargas; Nina P Tamirisa; Kristin M Sheffield; Taylor S Riall; Cost-effectiveness of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus observation in older patients presenting with mild biliary disease, J Gastrointest Surg, ; 18(9):1091-255X; 1616-22",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early elective cholecystectomy vs. observation,Not Stated,84 Years,65 Years,Not Stated,Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-34228.3,United States,2011,-39382.5
13316,Cost-utility analysis of chemotherapy regimens in elderly patients with stage III colon cancer,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy prolongs survival for stage III colon cancer patients but community-level evidence on the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of treatment for elderly patients is limited. Comparisons were between patients receiving no chemotherapy, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and FOLFOX (5-FU + oxaliplatin). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Surveillance Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Patients (>/=65 years) with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage III colon cancer at diagnosis in 2004-2009 were identified. The 3-way propensity score matched sample included 3,534 patients. Effectiveness was measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Medicare costs (2010 US dollars) were estimated from diagnosis until death or end of study. RESULTS: FOLFOX patients experienced 6.06 median life-years and 4.73 QALYs. Patients on 5-FU had 5.75 median life-years and 4.50 median QALYs, compared to 3.42 and 2.51, respectively, for the no chemotherapy patients. Average total healthcare costs ranged from US$85,422 for no chemotherapy to US$168,628 for FOLFOX. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for 5-FU versus no chemotherapy were US$17,131 per life-year gained and US$20,058 per QALY gained. ICERs for FOLFOX versus 5-FU were US$139,646 per life-year gained and US$188,218 per QALY gained. Results appear to be sensitive to age, suggesting that FOLFOX performs better for patients 65-69 and 80+ years old while 5-FU appears most effective and cost effective for the age groups 70-74 and 75-79 years.

In most parts of the world, mumps vaccine is routinely delivered through live attenuated Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) vaccine. In Japan, receiving mumps vaccine is voluntary and vaccine uptake rate is less than 30%. The introduction of mumps vaccine into routine vaccination schedule has become one of the current topics in health policy and has raised the need to evaluate efficient ways in protecting children from mumps-related diseases in Japan. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov model and calculated incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 11 different programmes; a single-dose programme at 12-16 months and 10 two-dose programmes with second dose uptakes at ages 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11. Our base-case analyse set the cost per shot at yen6951 (US$72; 1US$=96.8). Results show that single-dose programme dominates status quo.

13321,High-sensitive troponin T assay for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction: an economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Delayed diagnosis and treatment of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) has a major adverse impact on prognosis in terms of both morbidity and mortality. Since conventional cardiac Troponin assays have a low sensitivity for diagnosing AMI in the first hours after myocardial necrosis, high-sensitive assays have been developed. The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of a high-sensitive Troponin T assay (hsTnT), alone or combined with the heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) assay in comparison with the conventional cardiac Troponin (cTnT) assay for the diagnosis of AMI in patients presenting to the hospital with chest pain. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis (quality adjusted life years-QALYs) and a cost effectiveness analysis (life years gained-LYGs) based on a decision analytic model, using a health care perspective in the Dutch context and a life time time-horizon. The robustness of model predictions was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For a life time incremental cost of 30.70 Euros, use of hsTnT over conventional cTnT results in gain of 0.006 Life Years and 0.004 QALY. It should be noted here that hsTnT is a diagnostic intervention which costs only 4.39 Euros/test more than the cTnT test. The ICER generated with the use of hsTnT based diagnostic strategy comparing with the use of a cTnT-based strategy, is 4945 Euros per LYG and 7370 Euros per QALY. The hsTnT strategy has the highest probability of being cost effective at thresholds between 8000 and 20000 Euros per QALY. The combination of hsTnT and h-FABP strategy's probability of being cost effective remains lower than hsTnT at all willingness to pay thresholds.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of VTs insertion for the management of persistent bilateral OME in children, providing an additional perspective on the management of one of the commonest medical conditions of childhood. METHODS: A decision-tree model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of VTs strategy compared with the Hearing Aids (HAs) alone and HAs plus VTs strategies. The model used data from published sources, and assumed a 2-year time horizon and UK NHS perspective for costs. Outcomes were computed as Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) by attaching a utility value to the total potential gains in Hearing Level in decibels (dBHL) over 12 and 24 months. Modelling uncertainty in the specification of decision-tree probabilities and QALYs was performed through Monte Carlo simulation. Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) and partial EVPI (EVPPI) analyses were conducted to estimate the potential value of future research and uncertainty associated with the key parameters. RESULTS: The VTs strategy was more effective and less costly when compared with the HAs plus VTs strategy, while the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the VTs strategy compared with the HAs strategy was pound 5,086 per QALY gained. At the willingness-to-pay threshold of pound 20,000 per QALY, the probability that the VTs strategy is likely to be more cost-effective was 0.58. The EVPI value at population level of around pound 9.5 million at the willingness-to-pay threshold of pound 20,000 indicated that future research in this area is potentially worthwhile, while the EVPPI analysis indicated considerable uncertainty surrounding the parameters used for computing the QALYs for which more precise estimates would be most valuable. CONCLUSIONS: The VTs strategy is a cost-effective option when compared with the HAs alone and HAs plus VTs strategies, but the need for additional information from future study is evident to inform this surgical treatment choice.

13326,Cost effectiveness of group follow-up after structured education for type 1 diabetes: a cluster randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: This study examines the cost effectiveness of group follow-up after participation in the Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) structured education programme for type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Economic evaluation conducted alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial involving 437 adults with type 1 diabetes in Ireland. Group follow-up involved two group education 'booster' sessions post-DAFNE. Individual follow-up involved two standard one-to-one hospital clinic visits. Incremental costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and cost effectiveness were estimated at 18 months. Uncertainty was explored using sensitivity analysis and by estimating cost effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Group follow-up was associated with a mean reduction in QALYs gained of 0.04 per patient (P value, 0.052; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.01, intra-class correlation (ICC), 0.033) and a mean reduction in total healthcare costs of euro772 (P value, 0.020; 95% CI, -1,415 to -128: ICC, 0.016) per patient. At alternative threshold values of euro5,000, euro15,000, euro25,000, euro35,000, and euro45,000, the probability of group follow-up being cost effective was estimated to be 1.000, 0.762, 0.204, 0.078, and 0.033 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not support implementation of group follow-up as the sole means of follow-up post-DAFNE. Given the reported cost savings, future studies should explore the cost effectiveness of alternative models of group care for diabetes.

13327,A decision model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared to three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) in patients receiving radiotherapy to the prostate bed,"BACKGROUND: Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a radiation therapy technology that facilitates the delivery of an improved dose distribution with less dose to surrounding critical structures. This study estimates the longer term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of IMRT in patients post radical prostatectomy. METHODS: A Markov decision model was developed to calculate the incremental quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of IMRT compared with three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the Australian health care system. RESULTS: IMRT was both more effective and less costly than 3DCRT over 20 years, with an additional 20 QALYs gained and over $1.1 million saved per 1000 patients treated. This result was robust to plausible levels of uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT was estimated to have a modest long term advantage over 3DCRT in terms of both improved effectiveness and reduced cost. This result was reliant on clinical judgement and interpretation of the existing literature, but provides quantitative guidance on the cost effectiveness of IMRT whilst long term trial evidence is awaited.",2014-01-16437,24929702,Radiother Oncol,Hannah E Carter,2014,112 / 2,187-93,No,24929702,"Hannah E Carter; Andrew Martin; Deborah Schofield; Gillian Duchesne; Annette Haworth; Colin Hornby; Mark Sidhom; Michael Jackson; A decision model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared to three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) in patients receiving radiotherapy to the prostate bed, Radiother Oncol, ; 112(2):0167-8140; 187-93",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) vs. Three dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,"5 Years, 20 years",5.00,5.00,41572,Australia,2012,48542.77
13328,Improving inhaler adherence in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The PHARMACOP-intervention significantly improved medication adherence and inhalation technique for patients with COPD compared with usual care. This study aimed to evaluate its cost-effectiveness. METHODS: An economic analysis was performed from the Belgian healthcare payer's perspective. A Markov model was constructed in which a representative group of patients with COPD (mean age of 70 years, 66% male, 43% current smokers and mean Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second of % predicted of 50), was followed for either receiving the 3-month PHARMACOP-intervention or usual care. Three types of costs were calculated: intervention costs, medication costs and exacerbation costs. Outcome measures included the number of hospital-treated exacerbations, cost per prevented hospital-treated exacerbation and cost per Quality Adjusted Life-Year. Follow-up was 1 year in the basecase analysis. Sensitivity and scenario analyses (including long-term follow-up) were performed to assess uncertainty. RESULTS: In the basecase analysis, the average overall costs per patient for the PHARMACOP-intervention and usual care were euro2,221 and euro2,448, respectively within the 1-year time horizon. This reflects cost savings of euro227 for the PHARMACOP-intervention. The PHARMACOP-intervention resulted in the prevention of 0.07 hospital-treated exacerbations per patient (0.177 for PHARMACOP versus 0.244 for usual care). Results showed robust cost-savings in various sensitivity analyses.

13329,Are weekend inpatient rehabilitation services value for money? An economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial with a 30 day follow up,"BACKGROUND: Providing additional Saturday rehabilitation can improve functional independence and health related quality of life at discharge and it may reduce patient length of stay, yet the economic implications are not known. The aim of this study was to determine from a health service perspective if the provision of rehabilitation to inpatients on a Saturday in addition to Monday to Friday was cost effective compared to Monday to Friday rehabilitation alone. METHODS: Cost utility and cost effectiveness analyses were undertaken alongside a multi-center, single-blind randomized controlled trial with a 30-day follow up after discharge. Participants were adults admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in two publicly funded metropolitan rehabilitation facilities. The control group received usual care rehabilitation services from Monday to Friday and the intervention group received usual care plus an additional rehabilitation service on Saturday. Incremental cost utility ratio was reported as cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was reported as cost for a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in functional independence. RESULTS: 996 patients (mean age 74 (standard deviation 13) years) were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 496) or the control group (n = 500). Mean difference in cost of AUD$1,673 (95% confidence interval (CI) -271 to 3,618) was a saving in favor of the intervention group. The incremental cost utility ratio found a saving of AUD$41,825 (95% CI -2,817 to 74,620) per QALY gained for the intervention group. The ICER found a saving of AUD$16,003 (95% CI -3,074 to 87,361) in achieving a MCID in functional independence for the intervention group. If the willingness to pay per QALY gained or for a MCID in functional independence was zero dollars the probability of the intervention being cost effective was 96% and 95%, respectively. A sensitivity analysis removing Saturday penalty rates did not significantly alter the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: From a health service perspective, the provision of rehabilitation to inpatients on a Saturday in addition to Monday to Friday, compared to Monday to Friday rehabilitation alone, is likely to be cost saving per QALY gained and for a MCID in functional independence.

13330,Cost-effectiveness of interventions for increasing the possession of functioning smoke alarms in households with pre-school children: a modelling study,"BACKGROUND: The UK has one of the highest rates for deaths from fire and flames in children aged 0-14 years compared to other high income countries. Evidence shows that smoke alarms can reduce the risk of fire-related injury but little exists on their cost-effectiveness. We aimed to compare the cost effectiveness of different interventions for the uptake of 'functioning' smoke alarms and consequently for the prevention of fire-related injuries in children in the UK. METHODS: We carried out a decision model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis. We used a hypothetical population of newborns and evaluated the impact of living in a household with or without a functioning smoke alarm during the first 5 years of their life on overall lifetime costs and quality of life from a public health perspective. We compared seven interventions, ranging from usual care to more complex interventions comprising of education, free/low cost equipment giveaway, equipment fitting and/or home safety inspection. RESULTS: Education and free/low cost equipment was the most cost-effective intervention with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound34,200 per QALY gained compared to usual care. This was reduced to approximately pound4,500 per QALY gained when 1.8 children under the age of 5 were assumed per household.

13335,Should colorectal cancer screening be considered in elderly persons without previous screening? A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against routine screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) in adequately screened persons older than 75 years but does not address the appropriateness of screening in elderly persons without previous screening. OBJECTIVE: To determine at what ages CRC screening should be considered in unscreened elderly persons and to determine which test is indicated at each age. DESIGN: Microsimulation modeling study. DATA SOURCES: Observational and experimental studies. TARGET POPULATION: Unscreened persons aged 76 to 90 years with no, moderate, and severe comorbid conditions. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: One-time colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy, or fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years gained, costs, and costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: In unscreened elderly persons with no comorbid conditions, CRC screening was cost-effective up to age 86 years. Screening with colonoscopy was indicated up to age 83 years, sigmoidoscopy was indicated at age 84 years, and FIT was indicated at ages 85 and 86 years. In unscreened persons with moderate comorbid conditions, screening was cost-effective up to age 83 years (colonoscopy indicated up to age 80 years, sigmoidoscopy at age 81 years, and FIT at ages 82 and 83 years). In unscreened persons with severe comorbid conditions, screening was cost-effective up to age 80 years (colonoscopy indicated up to age 77 years, sigmoidoscopy at age 78 years, and FIT at ages 79 and 80 years). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Results were most sensitive to assuming a lower willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life-year gained. LIMITATION: Only persons at average risk for CRC were considered. CONCLUSION: In unscreened elderly persons CRC screening should be considered well beyond age 75 years. A colonoscopy is indicated at most ages.

13344,Cost-utility analysis of a pharmacotherapy follow-up for elderly nursing home residents in Spain,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacotherapy follow-up for elderly nursing home (NH) residents with that of usual care. DESIGN: Prospective observational study with a concurrent control group conducted over 12 months. SETTING: Fifteen NHs in Andalusia assigned to control (n = 6) or intervention (n = 9). PARTICIPANTS: Residents aged 65 and older. INTERVENTION: Pharmacotherapy follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Negative outcomes associated with medication, health-related quality of life, cost, quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). ICERs were estimated for three scenarios: unadjusted cost per QALY (first scenario), costs adjusted for baseline prescribed medication and QALYs adjusted for baseline utility score (second scenario), and costs and QALYs adjusted for a fuller set of baseline characteristics (third scenario). RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-two elderly residents were enrolled: 122 in the control group and 210 in the intervention group. The general practitioner accepted 88.7% (274/309) of pharmacist recommendations. Pharmacist interventions reduced the average number of prescribed medication by 0.47 drugs (P < .001), whereas the average prescribed medication increased by 0.94 drugs in the control group (P < .001). Both groups reported a lower average EuroQol-5D utility score after 12 months (intervention, -0.0576, P = .002; control, -0.0999, P = .003). For the first scenario, usual care dominated pharmacotherapy follow-up (was less effective and more expensive). Adjusted ICERs were euro 3,899/QALY ($5,002/QALY) for the second scenario and euro 6,574/QALY ($8,433/QALY) for the third scenario. For a willingness to pay of euro 30,000/QALY ($38,487/QALY), the probabilities of the pharmacotherapy follow-up being cost-effective were 35% for the first scenario, 78% for the second, and 76% for the third.

13345,"Pharmacoeconomic evaluation of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban versus enoxaparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement in Spain","BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) surgery are at high risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin, such as enoxaparin, is standard of care in these patients. Recently, three direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs; dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban), have been approved for this indication, but their cost effectiveness is still unclear as it has usually been extrapolated from surrogate venographic outcomes in clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the DOACs versus subcutaneous (SC) enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE after THR or TKR surgery. METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2011 to compare the cost utility and cost effectiveness of the DOACs with SC enoxaparin, with separate models for THR and TKR over a 3-month postoperative time horizon from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. The probabilities of events (symptomatic VTE, clinically relevant bleedings, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and deaths) were derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis. We used local cost estimates (euro2013) and utility values were obtained from the literature. We reported costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and symptomatic VTE events. We conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The average costs per 1,000 patients treated with enoxaparin were higher than costs incurred by dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban in THR (euro435,208 vs. euro283,574, euro257,900 and euro212,472, respectively) and TKR (euro336,550 vs. euro219,856, euro251,734 and euro201,946, respectively), with cost savings ranging from euro151,634 to euro222,766 in THR, and from euro84,816 to euro134,604 in TKR. Cost differences were largely driven by differences in costs associated with drug administration. The average QALYs per 1,000 patients treated were very similar for enoxaparin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban in THR (199.34, 198.83, 199.08 and 199.68, respectively) and TKR (198.95, 199.41, 198.75 and 199.97, respectively). Rivaroxaban (in TKR and THR) and apixaban (in THR) avoided additional symptomatic VTE events compared with enoxaparin. Sensitivity analyses generally supported the robustness of the analysis to changes in model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests, based on its underlying assumptions and data, that the DOACs are cost-saving alternatives to SC enoxaparin for the prevention of VTE after THR or TKR, in the Spanish healthcare setting.",2014-01-16460,24895235,Pharmacoeconomics,Antonio Gomez-Outes,2014,32 / 9,919-36,Yes,24895235,"Antonio Gomez-Outes; Cristina Avendano-Sola; Ana Isabel Terleira-Fernandez; Emilio Vargas-Castrillon; Pharmacoeconomic evaluation of dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban versus enoxaparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after total hip or knee replacement in Spain, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 32(9):1179-2027; 919-36",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dabigatran vs. Standard/Usual Care- Enoxaparin,Not Stated,68 Years,61 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,297321.59,Euro,2013,438709.54

We used local cost estimates (euro2013) and utility values were obtained from the literature. We reported costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and symptomatic VTE events. We conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The average costs per 1,000 patients treated with enoxaparin were higher than costs incurred by dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban in THR (euro435,208 vs. euro283,574, euro257,900 and euro212,472, respectively) and TKR (euro336,550 vs. euro219,856, euro251,734 and euro201,946, respectively), with cost savings ranging from euro151,634 to euro222,766 in THR, and from euro84,816 to euro134,604 in TKR. Cost differences were largely driven by differences in costs associated with drug administration. The average QALYs per 1,000 patients treated were very similar for enoxaparin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban in THR (199.34, 198.83, 199.08 and 199.68, respectively) and TKR (198.95, 199.41, 198.75 and 199.97, respectively).

13355,Cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel-aspirin versus aspirin alone for acute transient ischemic attack and minor stroke,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with the combination of clopidogrel and aspirin taken soon after a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke was shown to reduce the 90-day risk of stroke in a large trial in China, but the cost-effectiveness is unknown. This study sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the clopidogrel-aspirin regimen for acute TIA or minor stroke. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was created to determine the cost-effectiveness of treatment of acute TIA or minor stroke patients with clopidogrel-aspirin compared with aspirin alone. Inputs for the model were obtained from clinical trial data, claims databases, and the published literature. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. One-way and multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the findings. Compared with aspirin alone, clopidogrel-aspirin resulted in a lifetime gain of 0.037 QALYs at an additional cost of CNY 1250 (US$ 192), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CNY 33 800 (US$ 5200) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that clopidogrel-aspirin therapy was more cost-effective in 95.7% of the simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold recommended by the World Health Organization of CNY 105 000 (US$ 16 200) per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Early 90-day clopidogrel-aspirin regimen for acute TIA or minor stroke is highly cost-effective in China. Although clopidogrel is generic, Plavix is brand in China.

13356,A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of a grommets-led care pathway for children with cleft palate affected by otitis media with effusion,"There is a paucity of evidence to guide the management of otitis media with effusion (OME), which is a common problem causing significant hearing impairment in children with cleft palate. The insertion of grommets is currently being used to correct hearing impairment and prevent complications of unmanaged OME, but there is ongoing discussion about whether the benefits of grommets outweigh the costs and risks. A decision-tree model was developed to assess the surgical insertion of grommets with two non-surgical alternatives (hearing-aids and do-nothing strategies) in cleft palate children with persistent bilateral OME. The model assumed a 2-year time horizon and a UK National Health Service perspective. Outcomes were valued using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) estimated by linking utility values with potential hearing gains measured in decibels. Multiple data sources were used, including reviews of the clinical effectiveness, resource use and utility literature, and supplemented with expert opinion. Uncertainty in the model parameters was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Expected value of perfect information analysis was used to calculate the potential value of future research.

13359,Cost effectiveness of darunavir/ritonavir combination antiretroviral therapy for treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: The AntiRetroviral Therapy with TMC114 ExaMined In naive Subjects (ARTEMIS) clinical trial examined the efficacy and safety of two ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors (PI/r), darunavir/r 800/100 mg once daily (QD) and lopinavir/r 800/200 mg daily, both used in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine. This study aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of the darunavir/r regimen compared with the lopinavir/r regimen in treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection in Canada. METHODS: A Markov model with a 3-month cycle time and six CD4 cell-count-based health states (>500, 351-500, 201-500, 101-200, 51-100, and 0-50 cells/mm(3)) followed a cohort of treatment-naive adults with HIV-1 infection through initial darunavir/r or lopinavir/r combination therapy and a common set of subsequent regimens over the course of their remaining lifetimes. Population characteristics and transition probabilities were estimated from the ARTEMIS clinical trial and other trials. Costs (in 2014 Canadian dollars), utilities, and mortality were estimated from Canadian sources and published literature. Costs and health outcomes were discounted at 5% per year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, including a simple indirect comparison of the darunavir/r initial regimen with an atazanavir/r-based regimen. RESULTS: In the base-case lifetime analysis, individuals receiving initial therapy with the darunavir/r regimen experienced 0.25 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with lower antiretroviral drug costs (-$14,246) and total costs (-$18,402) than individuals receiving the lopinavir/r regimen, indicating that darunavir/r dominated lopinavir/r. In an indirect comparison with an atazanavir/r-based regimen, the darunavir/r regimen remained the dominant choice, but with lower cost savings (-$2,303) and QALY gains (0.02). Results were robust to a wide range of other changes in input parameter values, population characteristics, and modeling assumptions. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the darunavir/r regimen was cost effective compared with the lopinavir/r regimen in over 86% of simulations for willingness-to-pay thresholds between $0 and $100,000 per QALY gained.

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with active or recently active intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis enrolled in the Multicenter Uveitis Steroid Treatment Trial. METHODS: Data on cost and health utility during 3 years after randomization were evaluated at 6-month intervals. Analyses were stratified by disease laterality at randomization (31 unilateral vs 224 bilateral) because of the large upfront cost of the implant. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over 3 years: the ratio of the difference in cost (in United States dollars) to the difference in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs of medications, surgeries, hospitalizations, and regular procedures (e.g., laboratory monitoring for systemic therapy) were included. We computed QALYs as a weighted average of EQ-5D scores over 3 years of follow-up. RESULTS: The ICER at 3 years was $297,800/QALY for bilateral disease, driven by the high cost of implant therapy (difference implant - systemic [Delta]: $16,900; P < 0.001) and the modest gains in QALYs (Delta = 0.057; P = 0.22). The probability of the ICER being cost-effective at thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY was 0.003 and 0.04, respectively. The ICER for unilateral disease was more favorable, namely, $41,200/QALY at 3 years, because of a smaller difference in cost between the 2 therapies (Delta = $5300; P = 0.44) and a larger benefit in QALYs with the implant (Delta = 0.130; P = 0.12). The probability of the ICER being cost-effective at thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY was 0.53 and 0.74, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Fluocinolone acetonide implant therapy was reasonably cost-effective compared with systemic therapy for individuals with unilateral intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis but not for those with bilateral disease.

13362,Cost-effectiveness analysis of docetaxel versus weekly paclitaxel in adjuvant treatment of regional breast cancer in New Zealand,"BACKGROUND: There have been recent important changes to adjuvant regimens and costs of taxanes for the treatment of early breast cancer, requiring a re-evaluation of comparative cost effectiveness. In particular, weekly paclitaxel is now commonly used but has not been subjected to cost-effectiveness analysis. AIM: Our aim was to estimate the cost effectiveness of adjuvant docetaxel and weekly paclitaxel versus each other, and compared with standard 3-weekly paclitaxel, in women aged >/=25 years diagnosed with regional breast cancer in New Zealand. METHODS: A macrosimulation Markov model was used, with a lifetime horizon and health system perspective. The model compared 3-weekly docetaxel and weekly paclitaxel versus standard 3-weekly paclitaxel (E1199 regimen) in the hospital setting. Data on overall survival and toxicities (febrile neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy) were derived from relevant published clinical trials. Epidemiological and cost data were derived from New Zealand datasets. Health outcomes were measured with health-adjusted life-years (HALYs), similar to quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs included intervention and health system costs in year 2011 values, with 3% per annum discounting on costs and HALYs. RESULTS: The mean HALY gain per patient compared with standard 3-weekly paclitaxel was 0.51 with weekly paclitaxel and 0.21 with docetaxel, while incremental costs were $NZ 12,284 and $NZ 4,021, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of docetaxel versus 3-weekly paclitaxel was $NZ 19,400 (purchasing power parity [PPP]-adjusted $US 13,100) per HALY gained, and the ICER of weekly paclitaxel versus docetaxel was $NZ 27,100 ($US 18,300) per HALY gained. In terms of net monetary benefit, weekly paclitaxel was the optimal strategy for willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds >$NZ 27,000 per HALY gained. However, the model was highly sensitive to uncertainty around survival differences, while toxicity-related morbidity had little impact. Thus, if it was assumed that weekly paclitaxel and docetaxel had the same efficacy, docetaxel would be favoured over weekly paclitaxel. CONCLUSION: Both weekly paclitaxel and docetaxel are likely to be cost effective compared with standard 3-weekly paclitaxel. Weekly paclitaxel was the optimal choice for WTP thresholds greater than $NZ27,000 per HALY gained (PPP-adjusted $US 18,000).

13364,Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of intranasal live attenuated influenza vaccination of children in Germany,"In 2011, intranasally administered live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) was approved in the EU for prophylaxis of seasonal influenza in 2-17-year-old children. Our objective was to estimate the potential epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of an LAIV-based extension of the influenza vaccination programme to healthy children in Germany. An age-structured dynamic model of influenza transmission was developed and combined with a decision-tree to evaluate different vaccination strategies in the German health care system. Model inputs were based on published literature or were derived by expert consulting using the Delphi technique. Unit costs were drawn from German sources. Under base-case assumptions, annual routine vaccination of children aged 2-17 years with LAIV assuming an uptake of 50% would prevent, across all ages, 16 million cases of symptomatic influenza, over 600,000 cases of acute otitis media, nearly 130,000 cases of community-acquired pneumonia, nearly 1.7 million prescriptions of antibiotics and over 165,000 hospitalisations over 10 years. The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was <euro> 1,228 per quality-adjusted life year gained from a broad third-party payer perspective (including reimbursed direct costs and specific transfer payments), when compared with the current strategy of vaccinating primarily risk groups with the conventional trivalent inactivated vaccine. Inclusion of patient co-payments and indirect costs in terms of productivity losses resulted in discounted 10-year cost savings of <euro> 3.4 billion. In conclusion, adopting universal influenza immunisation of healthy children and adolescents would lead to a substantial reduction in influenza-associated disease at a reasonable cost to the German statutory health insurance system.

The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome impact and cost-effectiveness (CE) of various QART levels for a head and neck (H&N) cancer study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: QART levels were defined as: basic QART with a dummy run (level 2), level 2 plus prospective Individual Case Reviews (ICRs) for 15% of patients (level 3) and level 2 plus prospective ICRs for all patients (level 4). The follow-up of patients was modeled using a multi-state model with parameters derived from EORTC, TROG and RTOG prospective studies. Individual patient data, linking QART results with outcome, were retrieved from the TROG database. Results for each QART level were expressed as percentage of mortality and local failure at 5 years. RESULTS: Quality-of-life-adjusted and recurrence-free survival increased with increasing QART levels.

13367,Routine prophylactic central neck dissection for low-risk papillary thyroid cancer is not cost-effective,"BACKGROUND: The role of routine prophylactic central neck dissection (CND) in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost utility of the addition of routine CND in patients with low-risk PTC compared with total thyroidectomy (TT) alone. METHODS: A Markov model for low-risk PTC was constructed with a treatment algorithm based on the American Thyroid Association guidelines for well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Utilities and outcome probabilities were derived from published medical literature. US 2010 costs were examined from a society perspective using Medicare reimbursement rates and opportunity loss based on published US government data. Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis were used to examine the uncertainty of probability, cost and utility estimates. RESULTS: Initial TT alone is more cost-effective than TT with CND, resulting in a cost savings of US $5763 per patient with slightly higher effectiveness per patient (0.03 QALY) for a cost savings of $285 per QALY. Sensitivity analysis shows that TT alone offers no advantage when radioactive iodine (RAI) becomes more detrimental to a patient's state of health, when the incidence of non-neck recurrence increases above 5% in patients undergoing TT alone or decreases below 3.9% in patients undergoing TT with CND or when the rate of permanent hypocalcaemia rises above 4%. CONCLUSIONS: TT with CND is not a cost-effective strategy in low-risk PTC. Initial TT alone is favourable because of the low complication rates and low recurrence rates associated with the initial surgery. Alternative strategies such as unilateral prophylactic neck dissection require additional study to assess their cost-effectiveness.",2014-01-16491,24862564,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Arturo Garcia,2014,81 / 5,754-61,No,24862564,"Arturo Garcia; Barnard J A Palmer; Nancy A Parks; Terrence H Liu; Routine prophylactic central neck dissection for low-risk papillary thyroid cancer is not cost-effective, Clin Endocrinol (Oxf), ; 81(5):1365-2265; 754-61",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine prophylactic central neck dissection (CND) vs. total thyroidectomy (TT) alone,Not Stated,40 Years,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,42 Years,3.00,3.00,-156700,United States,2010,-185987.47
13368,Cost-effectiveness of the National Health Service Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme in England,"BACKGROUND: Implementation of the National Health Service abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening programme (NAAASP) for men aged 65 years began in England in 2009. An important element of the evidence base supporting its introduction was the economic modelling of the long-term cost-effectiveness of screening, which was based mainly on 4-year follow-up data from the Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS) randomized trial. Concern has been expressed about whether this conclusion of cost-effectiveness still holds, given the early performance parameters, particularly the lower prevalence of AAA observed in NAAASP. METHODS: The existing published model was adjusted and updated to reflect the current best evidence. It was recalibrated to mirror the 10-year follow-up data from MASS; the main cost parameters were re-estimated to reflect current practice; and more robust estimates of AAA growth and rupture rates from recent meta-analyses were incorporated, as were key parameters as observed in NAAASP (attendance rates, AAA prevalence and size distributions). RESULTS: The revised and updated model produced estimates of the long-term incremental cost-effectiveness of pound5758 (95 per cent confidence interval pound4285 to pound7410) per life-year gained, or pound7370 ( pound5467 to pound9443) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. CONCLUSION: Although the updated parameters, particularly the increased costs and lower AAA prevalence, have increased the cost per QALY, the latest modelling provides evidence that AAA screening as now being implemented in England is still highly cost-effective.",2014-01-16493,24862963,J Clin Psychopharmacol,M J Glover,2014,101 / 8,976-82,No,24862963,"M J Glover; L G Kim; M J Sweeting; S G Thompson; M J Buxton; Cost-effectiveness of the National Health Service Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme in England, J Clin Psychopharmacol, ; 101(8):0271-0749; 976-82",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,National Health Service abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,66 Years,Male,Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,7370,United Kingdom,2011,13604.16
13369,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of laryngeal examination after elective total thyroidectomy,"BACKGROUND: Although routine laryngeal examination (RLE) after thyroidectomy may cost more than selective laryngeal examination (SLE), it permits earlier detection and treatment of vocal cord palsy (VCP) and so may be cost-saving in the longer term. We compared the 2-year cost-effectiveness between RLE and SLE with RLE performed at 2 weeks (SLE-2w), 1 month (SLE-1m), and 3 months (SLE-3m) after thyroidectomy in the institution's perspective. METHODS: Our case definition was a hypothetical 50-year-old woman who underwent an elective total thyroidectomy for a benign multinodular goiter. A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare the estimated cost-effectiveness between RLE, SLE-2w, SLE-1m, and SLE-3m after a 2-year period. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were estimated from the literature. The threshold for cost-effectiveness was set at US$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity and threshold analyses were used to examine model uncertainty. RESULTS: RLE was not cost-effective because its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to SLE-2w, SLE-1m, and SLE-3m were US$302,755, US$227,883 and US$247,105, respectively. RLE was only cost-effective when the temporary VCP rate increased >42.7 % or when the cost of RLE equaled zero. Similarly, SLE-2w was only cost-effective to SLE-3m when dysphonia for temporary VCP at 3 months increased >39.13 %, dysphonia for permanent VCP at 3 months increased >50.29 %, or dysphonia without VCP at 3 months increased >42.69 %. However, none of these scenarios appeared clinically likely. CONCLUSIONS: In the institution's perspective, RLE was not cost-effective against the other three SLE strategies. Regarding to the optimal timing of SLE, SLE-3m appears to be a reasonable and acceptable strategy because of its relative low overall cost.",2014-01-16495,24866435,Ann Surg Oncol,Brian Hung-Hin Lang,2014,21 / 11,3548-56,No,24866435,"Brian Hung-Hin Lang; Carlos K H Wong; Raymond K Y Tsang; Kai Pun Wong; Birgitta Y H Wong; Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of laryngeal examination after elective total thyroidectomy, Ann Surg Oncol, ; 21(11):1068-9265; 3548-56",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Routine laryngeal examination (RLE) vs. selective laryngeal examination (SLE), 2 weeks",underwent elective total thyroidectomy for benign multinodular goiter,Not Stated,51 Years,Female,Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,302755,United States,2012,341282.11
13370,The cost effectiveness of Botox in Italian patients with chronic migraine,"Migraine is a primary headache which World Health Organization ranks in 19th place in the list of disabling diseases. In Europe, in 2004, the total costs for migraine were quantified by Stovner and Berg, Eur J Neurol, 12(s1) (2005) at <euro>27 billion. The objective of this study is to provide an estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the treatment of chronic migraine with Botox compared to treatment with placebo in the perspective of the Italian National Health Service and society. To do this we studied the disease progression in a cohort of 688 individuals (patients enrolled in the study PREEMPT) via the application of a Markov model. Over a period of 2 years, the total costs of the experimental arm of the model amounted to <euro>3,274 compared with a gain of 1.34 QALYs. In contrast, the costs of the control arm amounted to <euro>2,395 with a gain of 1.24 QALYs. It follows that the incremental costs amounted to <euro>889 compared to an incremental gain of 0.09 QALYs in favor of the experimental arm. The relationship between costs and incremental QALYs generated an ICER of <euro>9,407/QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, therefore, is favorable compared to the value usually considered by NICE as a threshold limit for reimbursement which ranges between <euro>20,000 and <euro>40,000/QALY.",2014-01-16498,24867835,Neurol Sci,M Ruggeri,2014,35 Suppl 1 /,45-7,No,24867835,"M Ruggeri; The cost effectiveness of Botox in Italian patients with chronic migraine, Neurol Sci, ; 35 Suppl 1():1590-1874; 45-7",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Botox vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,9407,Euro,2008,16651.63

13373,"Benefits, harms, and costs for breast cancer screening after US implementation of digital mammography","BACKGROUND: Compared with film, digital mammography has superior sensitivity but lower specificity for women aged 40 to 49 years and women with dense breasts. Digital has replaced film in virtually all US facilities, but overall population health and cost from use of this technology are unclear. METHODS: Using five independent models, we compared digital screening strategies starting at age 40 or 50 years applied annually, biennially, or based on density with biennial film screening from ages 50 to 74 years and with no screening. Common data elements included cancer incidence and test performance, both modified by breast density. Lifetime outcomes included mortality, quality-adjusted life-years, and screening and treatment costs. RESULTS: For every 1000 women screened biennially from age 50 to 74 years, switching to digital from film yielded a median within-model improvement of 2 life-years, 0.27 additional deaths averted, 220 additional false-positive results, and $0.35 million more in costs. For an individual woman, this translates to a health gain of 0.73 days. Extending biennial digital screening to women ages 40 to 49 years was cost-effective, although results were sensitive to quality-of-life decrements related to screening and false positives.

13380,Cost-effectiveness of FDG-PET/CT for cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules: a decision analytic approach,"CONTEXT: Patients with thyroid nodules of indeterminate cytology undergo diagnostic surgery according to current guidelines. In 75% of patients, the nodule is benign. In these patients, surgery was unnecessary and unbeneficial because complications may occur. Preoperative fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) was found to have a very high negative predictive value (96%) and might therefore avoid futile surgery, complications, and costs. In the United States, two molecular tests of cytology material are routinely used for this purpose. OBJECTIVE: Five-year cost-effectiveness for routine implementation of FDG-PET/CT was evaluated in adult patients with indeterminate fine-needle aspiration cytology and compared with surgery in all patients and both molecular tests. DESIGN: A Markov decision model was developed to synthesize the evidence on cost-effectiveness about the four alternative strategies. The model was probabilistically analyzed. One-way sensitivity analyses of deterministic input variables likely to influence outcome were performed. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: The model was representative for adult patients with cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The discounted incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB), the efficiency decision rule containing outcomes as quality-adjusted life-years and (direct) medical cost, of implementation of FDG-PET/CT is displayed. RESULTS: Full implementation of FDG-PET/CT resulted in 40% surgery for benign nodules, compared with 75% in the conventional approach, without a difference in recurrence free and overall survival. The FDG-PET/CT modality is the more efficient technology, with a mean iNMB of euro3684 compared with surgery in all. Also, compared with a gene expression classifier test and a molecular marker panel, the mean iNMB of FDG-PET/CT was euro1030 and euro3851, respectively, and consequently the more efficient alternative. CONCLUSION: Full implementation of preoperative FDG-PET/CT in patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules could prevent up to 47% of current unnecessary surgery leading to lower costs and a modest increase of health-related quality of life.

13383,Economic and health effect of full adherence to controller therapy in adults with uncontrolled asthma: a simulation study,"BACKGROUND: Adherence to evidence-based controller treatments for asthma is disappointingly low in many jurisdictions. Quantifying the burden associated with suboptimal adherence in patients with uncontrolled asthma will help establish the priorities for policymakers. OBJECTIVE: We sought to quantify the benefits in the United States of improving adherence to controller therapies in adults with uncontrolled asthma in terms of health care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). METHODS: A Markov model of asthma was created to simulate the effect of treatment with controller medications on asthma control and exacerbations over a 10-year time horizon. Health care costs and QALYs associated with the current level of adherence (status quo) were compared with a hypothetical scenario in which each patient with uncontrolled asthma at baseline will be fully adherent to an evidence-based controller therapy (the full-adherence scenario). We also evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adherence interventions as a function of their costs and improvement in the adherence. RESULTS: The status quo level of asthma management was associated with $2,786 costs and 7.55 QALYs over 10 years, whereas the corresponding values for the full-adherence scenario were $5,973 and 7.68, respectively. Consequently, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the full-adherence versus the status quo was $24,515/QALY. To be cost-effective, a program that improves adherence by 50% should cost less than $130 ($450) per person annually at a willingness-to-pay value of $50,000/QALY ($100,000/QALY). Inclusion of productivity loss in the analysis resulted in the full-adherence scenario being cost-saving. CONCLUSION: Considering the extent of suboptimal adherence, our study shows that attempts in improving adherence to evidence-based therapies in patients with uncontrolled asthma can be associated with significant return on investment.",2014-01-16507,24875619,J Allergy Clin Immunol,Zafar Zafari,2014,134 / 4,908-915.e3,No,24875619,"Zafar Zafari; Larry D Lynd; J Mark FitzGerald; Mohsen Sadatsafavi; Economic and health effect of full adherence to controller therapy in adults with uncontrolled asthma: a simulation study, J Allergy Clin Immunol, ; 134(4):0091-6749; 908-915.e3",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full adherence to controller therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,24515,United States,2011,28206.54
13384,Cost effectiveness of duloxetine for osteoarthritis: a Quebec societal perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of duloxetine compared to other oral postacetaminophen treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) from a Quebec societal perspective. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed enhancing the Markov model from the 2008 OA guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). The NICE model was extended to include opioid and antidepressant comparators, adding titration, discontinuation, and relevant adverse events (AEs). Comparators included duloxetine, celecoxib, diclofenac, naproxen, hydromorphone, and oxycodone extended release (oxycodone). AEs included gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as fracture, opioid abuse, and constipation, among others. Costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated in 2011 Canadian dollars. The base case modeled a cohort of 55-year-old patients with OA for a 12-month period of treatment, followed by treatment from a basket of post-discontinuation oral therapies until death. Sensitivity analyses (one-way and probabilistic) were conducted. RESULTS: Overall, naproxen was the least expensive treatment, whereas oxycodone was the most expensive. Duloxetine accumulated the highest number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with an ICER of $36,291 per QALY versus celecoxib. Duloxetine was dominant over opioids. In subgroup analyses, ICERs for duloxetine versus celecoxib were $15,619 and $20,463 for patients at high risk of NSAID-related AEs and patients ages >65 years, respectively.

13392,Cost effectiveness of duloxetine for osteoarthritis: a Quebec societal perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of duloxetine compared to other oral postacetaminophen treatments for osteoarthritis (OA) from a Quebec societal perspective. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed enhancing the Markov model from the 2008 OA guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). The NICE model was extended to include opioid and antidepressant comparators, adding titration, discontinuation, and relevant adverse events (AEs). Comparators included duloxetine, celecoxib, diclofenac, naproxen, hydromorphone, and oxycodone extended release (oxycodone). AEs included gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), as well as fracture, opioid abuse, and constipation, among others.

13393,Cost-effectiveness of uterine-preserving procedures for the treatment of uterine fibroid symptoms in the USA,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the following three treatments of uterine fibroids in a population of premenopausal women who wish to preserve their uteri: myomectomy, magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) and uterine artery embolization (UAE). MATERIALS & METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was constructed. Cost-effectiveness was calculated in terms of US$ per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) over 5 years. Two types of costs were calculated: direct costs only, and the sum of direct and indirect (productivity) costs. Women in the hypothetical cohort were assessed for treatment type eligibility, were treated based on eligibility, and experienced adequate or inadequate symptom relief. Additional treatment (myomectomy) occurred for inadequate symptom relief or recurrence. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate uncertainty in the model parameters. RESULTS: In the base case, myomectomy, MRgFUS and UAE had the following combinations of mean cost and mean QALYs, respectively: US$15,459, 3.957; US$15,274, 3.953; and US$18,653, 3.943. When incorporating productivity costs, MRgFUS incurred a mean cost of US$21,232; myomectomy US$22,599; and UAE US$22,819. Using probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and excluding productivity costs, myomectomy was cost effective at almost every decision threshold. Using PSA and incorporating productivity costs, myomectomy was cost effective at decision thresholds above US$105,000/QALY; MRgFUS was cost effective between US$30,000 and US$105,000/QALY; and UAE was cost effective below US$30,000/QALY.

13395,Cost-effectiveness of lumbar discectomy and single-level fusion for spondylolisthesis: experience with the NeuroPoint-SD registry,"OBJECT: There is significant practice variation and uncertainty as to the value of surgical treatments for lumbar spine disorders. The authors' aim was to establish a multicenter registry to assess the efficacy and costs of common lumbar spinal procedures by using prospectively collected outcomes. METHODS: An observational prospective cohort study was completed at 13 academic and community sites. Patients undergoing single-level fusion for spondylolisthesis or single-level lumbar discectomy were included. The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) data were obtained preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Power analysis estimated a sample size of 160 patients: lumbar disc (125 patients) and lumbar listhesis (35 patients). The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) data were calculated using 6-dimension utility index scores. Direct costs and complication costs were estimated using Medicare reimbursement values from 2011, and indirect costs were estimated using the human capital approach with the 2011 US national wage index. Total costs equaled $14,980 for lumbar discectomy and $43,852 for surgery for lumbar spondylolisthesis. RESULTS: There were 198 patients enrolled over 1 year. The mean age was 46 years (49% female) for lumbar discectomy (n = 148) and 58.1 years (60% female) for lumbar spondylolisthesis (n = 50). Ten patients with disc herniation (6.8%) and 1 with listhesis (2%) required repeat operation at 1 year. The overall 1-year follow-up rate was 88%. At 30 days, both lumbar discectomy and single-level fusion procedures were associated with significant improvements in ODI, visual analog scale, and SF-36 scores (p = 0.0002), which persisted at the 1-year evaluation (p < 0.0001). By 1 year, more than 80% of patients in each cohort who were working preoperatively had returned to work. Lumbar discectomy was associated with a gain of 0.225 QALYs over the 1-year study period ($66,578/QALY gained). Lumbar spinal fusion for Grade I listhesis was associated with a gain of 0.195 QALYs over the 1-year study period ($224,420/QALY gained). CONCLUSIONS: This national spine registry demonstrated successful collection of high-quality outcomes data for spinal procedures in actual practice. These data are useful for demonstrating return to work and cost-effectiveness following surgical treatment of single-level lumbar disc herniation or spondylolisthesis.

13397,Cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa in classic-infantile patients with Pompe disease,"BACKGROUND: Infantile Pompe disease is a rare metabolic disease. Patients generally do not survive the first year of life. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has proven to have substantial effects on survival in infantile Pompe disease. However, the costs of therapy are very high. In this paper, we assess the cost-effectiveness of enzyme replacement therapy in infantile Pompe disease. METHODS: A patient simulation model was used to compare costs and effects of ERT with costs of effects of supportive therapy (ST). The model was filled with data on survival, quality of life and costs. For both arms of the model, data on survival were obtained from international literature. In addition, survival as observed among 20 classic-infantile Dutch patients, who all received ERT, was used. Quality of life was measured using the EQ-5D and assumed to be the same in both treatment groups. Costs included the costs of ERT (which depend on a child's weight), infusions, costs of other health care utilization, and informal care. A lifetime time horizon was used, with 6-month time cycles. RESULTS: Life expectancy was significantly longer in the ERT group than in the ST group. On average, ST receiving patients were modelled not to survive the first half year of life; whereas the life expectancy in the ERT patients was modelled to be almost 14 years. Lifetime incremental QALYs were 6.8. Incremental costs were estimated to be euro 7.0 million, which primarily consisted of treatment costs (95%). The incremental costs per QALY were estimated to be euro 1.0 million (range sensitivity analyses: euro 0.3 million - euro 1.3 million). The incremental cost per life year gained was estimated to be euro 0.5 million. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental costs per QALY ratio is far above the conventional threshold values.

13398,Cost-effectiveness of a peer and practice staff support intervention,"OBJECTIVES: We examined the cost-effectiveness of an intervention to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and blood pressure in African Americans. STUDY DESIGN: Stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a clinical trial, augmented by a Markov model of lifetime cost-effectiveness. METHODS: In 2 urban academic primary care practices, we randomized African American patients with uncontrolled hypertension to a 6-month intervention of office practice and peer coach behavioral support (N = 136) or informational brochures about CHD risk factors (N = 144). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the provider. Outcomes included estimated CHD events avoided over 6 months and reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (mm Hg). Subgroup analysis was performed for compliers who received an ""effective"" dose of the peer coach and office staff visits. Long-term cost-effectiveness was estimated by applying the clinical trial cost and effectiveness into a Markov model of CHD risk. RESULTS: The average cost for the behavioral support intervention group was $435.36 compared with $74.39 for the brochure control group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $47 per mm Hg reduction in SBP and $453,419 per CHD event avoided in 6 months. Modeled over a 10-year horizon, the intervention had an ICER only as high as $3998 per incremental quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: A community-primary care practice behavioral intervention to reduce hypertension in African Americans with sustained uncontrolled hypertension does not appear to be cost-effective in the first 6 months.

METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted in accordance to the new French guidelines of the Commission for Economic Evaluation and Public Health (CEESP), to adopt the recommended efficiency frontier approach. A cohort of patients with NVAF eligible for stroke preventive treatment was simulated over lifetime. Clinical events modeled included strokes, systemic embolism, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant non-major bleeds, and myocardial infarction. Efficacy and bleeding data for warfarin, apixaban, and aspirin were obtained from ARISTOTLE and AVERROES trials, whilst efficacy data for other NOACs were from published indirect comparisons. Acute medical costs were obtained from a dedicated analysis of the French national hospitalization database (PMSI). Long-term medical costs and utility data were derived from the literature. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model projections. RESULTS: Warfarin and apixaban were the two optimal treatment choices, as the other five treatment strategies including aspirin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran in sequential dosages, dabigatran 150 mg, and rivaroxaban were strictly dominated on the efficiency frontier. Further, apixaban was a cost-effective alternative vs warfarin with an incremental cost of euro2314 and an incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of 0.189, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro12,227/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Apixaban may be the most economically efficient alternative to warfarin in NVAF patients eligible for stroke prevention in France.
