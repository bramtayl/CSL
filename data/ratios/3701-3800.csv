3701,The long-term cost effectiveness of treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia,"INTRODUCTION: Excellent treatment outcomes with long-term durability and few adverse effects are expectations of treatments for chronic conditions. The long-term cost effectiveness of newer treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), including high-energy transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) and combination pharmaceutical therapy, has not been sufficiently studied against existing alternatives. The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of BPH treatment alternatives. METHODS: We employed a Markov model over a 20-year time horizon and the payer's perspective to evaluate the cost effectiveness of watchful waiting (WW), pharmaceuticals (alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists [alpha-blockers], 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors [5-ARIs], combination therapy), TUMT and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in treating BPH. Markov states included improvement in symptoms, no improvement in symptoms, adverse effects and death.We used data from the published literature for outcomes, including systematic reviews whenever possible. Costs were estimated using a managed-care claims database and Medicare fee schedules, and were reported in Dollars US, 2004 values. Costs and effectiveness outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Men (aged > or =45 years) with moderate to severe lower urinary tract symptoms and uncomplicated BPH were included in the analysis, and results were stratified by age and BPH symptom levels.Outcomes included costs, QALYs, incremental cost-utility ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Sensitivity analysis was performed on important parameters, with an emphasis on probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: alpha-Blockers and TUMT were cost effective for treating moderate symptoms using the threshold of Dollars US 50,000 per QALY. For example, at 65 years of age, the cost per QALY was Dollars US 16,018 for alpha-blockers compared with WW and Dollars US 30,204 for TUMT versus alpha-blockers. TURP was the most cost-effective treatment for severe symptoms (Dollars US 5824 per QALY ) versus WW. Model results were robust to changes in costs and sensitive to the assumed probabilities, utility weights, extent of improvement and life expectancy. Nevertheless, acceptability curves consistently demonstrated the same alternatives as most likely to be cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that alpha-blockers and TURP appear to be the most cost-effective alternatives, from a US payer perspective, for BPH patients with moderate and severe symptoms, respectively. TUMT was promising for patients with moderate symptoms and the oldest patients with severe symptoms, but otherwise was dominated.

3706,A multi-country economic evaluation of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease,"BACKGROUND: Low-dose aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) is standard care in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The use of low-dose aspirin in primary prevention is not yet fully established, although meta-analyses and US and European guidelines support its use in people at increased risk of CVD. The primary objective of this study was to assess the economic consequences of the use of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of CVD in four European countries (UK, Germany, Spain and Italy). METHODS: Based on results (benefits and harms) reported in meta-analyses, a state-transition model was developed to predict the cost effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of CVD. The model consists of five health states: no history of CVD, history of stroke, history of myocardial infarction (MI), history of stroke and MI, and death. A 10-year time horizon and 1-year cycles were used. Secondary prevention data were derived from the aspirin arm of the CAPRIE (Clopidogrel versus Aspirin in Patients at Risk of Ischaemic Events) study.Direct costs from the public healthcare payer's perspective were used (euro, 2003 values). Effects were expressed in life-years (LY) and QALYs gained. Quality weights were obtained from published data.Country-specific discounting was applied on effects and costs (3.5% for the UK, 5% for Germany and 3% for Spain and Italy). Univariate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were performed to assess uncertainty in the results. RESULTS: For patients with an annual risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) of 1.5%, the model resulted in 10-year savings with low-dose aspirin of on average euro 201 (95% CI 81, 331), euro 281 (95% CI 141, 422), euro 797 (95% CI 301, 1331) and euro 427 (95% CI 122, 731) per patient in the UK, Germany, Spain and Italy, respectively. Average total cost was almost 3- to 4-fold higher in Spain and Italy than in the UK and Germany. Savings (non-significant) start in the first year of treatment in all countries.Sensitivity analyses on cost of complications, utility, discounting, stroke rate and gastrointestinal bleeding rate showed the robustness of the results. From an annual risk of CHD of 0.236% for the UK, 0.324% for Germany, 0.244% for Spain and 0.560% for Italy, low-dose aspirin was cost saving compared with placebo. Monte Carlo analysis showed aspirin dominance in about 97% of cases for the three studied annual risks of CHD (0.6%, 1.0% and 1.5%) in the UK, Germany and Spain. In Italy, aspirin dominance in > 95% of cases was seen at annual risks of 1% and 1.5%.

Worldwide, these diseases lead to significant mortality, morbidity and costs. The societal impact is especially severe since the majority of cases occur in very young infants. A combination vaccine consisting of 9-valent conjugated pneumococcal and meningococcal B components is currently being developed. The aim of this study was to estimate the potential impact and cost effectiveness from the societal perspective of vaccinating infants in The Netherlands with this combination pneumococcal and meningococcal B vaccine versus no vaccination. METHODS: A Markov cycle model was developed using epidemiological and healthcare resource use data from 1996 to 2001. This model was used to project the annual costs, benefits and health gains associated with vaccinating all newborns. The base year for the costing was 2003 and all costs and health effects were discounted at 4%. The results of the analysis are expressed in costs per QALY and both probabilistic and univariate sensitivity analyses were used to identify the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Annually, an average of 755 cases of invasive pneumococcal and meningococcal B infection occurred in infants aged 0-10 years in The Netherlands. Introduction of the combination vaccine would prevent 201 cases of meningococcal B meningitis and 165 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease per year. Additionally, 3410 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia and 46,350 cases of otitis media would be prevented. Vaccination would save 35 lives per year and prevent 71 cases of severe sequelae. This translates into 860 life-years gained, or 1128 QALYs gained.Alongside these health gains, vaccination would prevent euro 17,681,370 of direct medical and indirect costs attributable to meningococcal and pneumococcal infections in The Netherlands. Depending on vaccine price, cost effectiveness varied from euro 3160 (vaccine price per dose euro 20) to euro 32,170 (vaccine price euro 60 per dose) per QALY. Base-case cost effectiveness (vaccine price euro 40) was euro 17,700 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to changes in incidence, vaccine price and duration of protective efficacy. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the introduction of a combination meningococcal B and pneumococcal vaccine into the Dutch infant vaccination programme is potentially cost effective compared with no vaccination.",2006-01-02812,16460135,Pharmacoeconomics,Jasper M Bos,2006,24 / 2,141-53,Yes,16460135,"Jasper M Bos; Hans C Rümke; Robert Welte; Lodewijk Spanjaard; Loek van Alphen; Maarten J Postma; Combination vaccine against invasive meningococcal B and pneumococcal infections: potential epidemiological and economic impact in the Netherlands, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(2):1179-2027; 141-53",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Meningococcal B vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,3 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,Not Stated,17700,Euro,2003,28184.26
3711,Economic evaluation of oral treatments for neuropathic pain,"The effectiveness of amitriptyline, carbamazepine, gabapentin, and tramadol for the treatment of neuropathic pain has been demonstrated, but it is unknown which one is the most cost-effective. We designed a cost-utility analysis of a hypothetical cohort with neuropathic pain of postherpetic or diabetic origin. The perspective of the economic evaluation was that of a third-party payor. For effectiveness and safety estimates, we performed a systematic review of the literature. For direct cost estimates, we used average wholesale prices, and the American Medicare and Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedules. For utilities of health states, we used the Health Utilities Index. We modeled 1 month of therapy. For comparisons among treatments, we estimated incremental cost per utility gained. To allow for uncertainty from variations in drug effectiveness, safety, and amount of medication needed, we conducted a probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation. Amitriptyline was the cheapest strategy, followed by carbamazepine, and both were equally beneficial. Gabapentin was the most expensive as well as the least beneficial. A multivariable probabilistic simulation produced similar results to the base-case scenario. In summary, amitriptyline and carbamazepine are more cost-effective than tramadol and gabapentin and should be considered as first-line treatment for neuropathic pain in patients free of renal or cardiovascular disease. PERSPECTIVE: Prescription practices should be based on the best available evidence, which includes the evaluation of the medication's cost-effectiveness.

3714,Quality of life and cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha in malignant melanoma: results from randomised trial,"A definitive conclusion regarding the value of low-dose extended duration adjuvant interferon-alpha therapy in the treatment of malignant melanoma is only possible once data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and costs have been considered. This trial randomised 674 patients to interferon alpha-2a (3 megaunits three times per week for 2 years or until recurrence) or placebo. Health-related quality of life (QoL) was to be assessed up to 60 months using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30. Data for the economic analysis, including cost information and the EQ-5D were also collected. Patients in the observation (OBS) group had significantly better mean follow-up quality of on five dimensions of the EORTC QLQ-C30 functional scales: role functioning (P = 0.033), emotional functioning (P = 0.003), cognitive functioning (P = 0.001), social functioning (P = 0.003) and global health status (P = 0.001). Patients in the OBS group had significantly better mean follow-up symptom scores on seven dimensions of the EORTC QLQ-C30 V1 symptom scales. Economic data showed that costs were 3066 pounds higher in the interferon group and produces an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year of 41,432 pounds at 5 years. The results show that interferon has significant effects on QoL and symptomatology and is unlikely to be cost-effective in this patient group in the UK.",2006-01-02816,16449995,Br J Cancer,S Dixon,2006,94 / 4,492-8,No,16449995,"S Dixon; S J Walters; L Turner; B W Hancock; Quality of life and cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha in malignant melanoma: results from randomised trial, Br J Cancer, 2006-Feb-27; 94(4):0007-0920; 492-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Interferon alpha-2a at 3 megaunits three times per week for 2 years or until recurrence (results for 5 years),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,Not Stated,41432,United Kingdom,2003,95263.65
3715,Cost-effectiveness of extending cervical cancer screening intervals among women with prior normal pap tests,"OBJECTIVE: Annual cervical cancer screening in women with many prior normal Pap tests is common despite limited evidence on the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of screening women with 3 or more prior normal tests compared with screening those with no prior tests. METHODS: We used a validated cost-effectiveness model in conjunction with data on the prevalence of biopsy-proven cervical neoplasia in women enrolled in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. Women were grouped according to age at the final Program Pap test (aged < 30, 30-44, 45-59, and 60-65 years) and by screening history (0, 1, 2, and 3+ consecutive prior normal Program tests) to estimate cost per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year associated with annual, biennial, and triennial screening. RESULTS: For women aged 30-44 years with no prior tests, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from 20,533 US dollars for screening triennially (compared with no further screening) to 331,837 US dollars for screening annually (compared with biennially) per life-year saved. Among same-aged women with 3 or more prior normal Program tests, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the same measures ranged from 60,029 US dollars to 709,067 US dollars per life-year saved. Inclusion of the most conservative utility estimates resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in excess of 100,000 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year saved associated with annual screening of same-aged women with 3 or more prior normal tests compared with biennial screening. CONCLUSION: As the number of prior normal Pap tests increases, the costs per life-year saved increase substantially. Resources should be prioritized for screening those never or rarely screened women.

3716,Cost-effectiveness of the Taxus paclitaxel-eluting stent in the Swedish healthcare system,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the cost-effectiveness of Taxus compared to a bare-metal stent in patients with coronary artery disease in the Swedish healthcare setting. DESIGN: A decision-analytic model combining clinical data on revascularization rates with Swedish unit costs for medical resources and utility data from the literature. RESULTS: For patients of moderate risk, the average cost per patient at 12 months is 72,200 SEK for Taxus and 66,900 SEK for a bare-metal stent, while the average cost for high risk patients is nearly equivalent (73,000 vs. 71,700 SEK). The cost per revascularization avoided is generally favourable, while the incremental cost per QALY gained varies depending on the assumptions made; from 2,351,000 SEK for patients of moderate risk at 12-months to cost saving at 24 months for high risk patients. Budget impact scenarios at 12 months are cost-neutral. CONCLUSION: The Taxus stent is cost-effective in high risk patients, particularly at 24 months. Although it may be less cost-effective for the general population, there is still a substantial offset of initial procedure costs through lower rate of repeat revascularizations.",2006-01-02818,16448993,Scand Cardiovasc J,Mattias Ekman,2006,40 / 1,17-24,No,16448993,"Mattias Ekman; Iwar Sjögren; Stefan James; Cost-effectiveness of the Taxus paclitaxel-eluting stent in the Swedish healthcare system, Scand Cardiovasc J, 2006-Feb; 40(1):1401-7431; 17-24",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Use of Taxus paclitaxel eluting stent,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,2350844,Sweden,2004,439077.54
3717,Economic evaluation of rivastigmine in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia,"BACKGROUND: The positive results of a randomised clinical trial of rivastigmine in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson's disease have been published recently. Patient-level healthcare utilisation data were also collected, and this report is the economic evaluation based on these data. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of rivastigmine 3-12 mg/day in patients in whom mild to moderate dementia developed at least 2 years after they received a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by applying Canadian and UK cost weights (year 2004 values) to healthcare utilisation data collected prospectively during a randomised, double-blind, multinational, 24-week trial of rivastigmine 3-12 mg/day (n = 362) versus placebo (n = 179). Patients were > or =50 years of age, had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of between 20 and 24 and had contact with a responsible caregiver at least 3 days a week.Quality-adjusted survival time, transformed from MMSE scores, was the measure of effectiveness. Caregiver costs included paid and unpaid time, and direct costs included concomitant medications, outpatient care, hospitalisations, long-term care and study medications. Analysis was conducted from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 24 weeks. RESULTS: Consistent with the improvement in clinical outcomes, there was an observed increase in quality-adjusted survival time in the rivastigmine arm of 2.81 quality-adjusted life-days (two-sided p-value 0.13 [90% CI -0.243, 5.86]). Using Canadian price weights, there was an observed increase in cost in the rivastigmine arm of Can 55.76 dollars(two-sided p-value 0.98 [90% CI -3431, 3543]), with a resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Can 7429 dollars per QALY. Using UK price weights, there was an observed decrease in cost in the rivastigmine arm of pound 26.18 (two-sided p-value 0.99 [90% CI -2407, 2355]). CONCLUSION: Although no between-treatment differences in cost were seen, the small sample size, highly variable cost distributions and short time horizon prevent us from making strong conclusions with regard to the effect of rivastigmine on total costs and, by inference, on cost effectiveness.",2006-01-02819,16445306,Pharmacoeconomics,Andrew R Willan,2006,24 / 1,93-106,Yes,16445306,"Andrew R Willan; Ron Goeree; Eleanor M Pullenayegum; Christopher McBurney; Gordon Blackhouse; Economic evaluation of rivastigmine in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(1):1179-2027; 93-106",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rivastigmine 3-12 mg/day,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,24 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,7429,Canada,2004,7833.65

OBJECTIVE: To quantify the potential economic impact of two regimens of subcutaneous bemiparin 115 IU/kg/day for 7-10 days (plus oral anticoagulants [OAC] or followed by long-term bemiparin 3500IU) versus dose-adjusted intravenous UFH for 7 days plus OAC for 3 months in the acute and long-term treatment of DVT. The representative patient was a 62-year-old, 77 kg male with proximal DVT of the lower limbs. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a decision-tree modelling approach. The results were expressed in terms of costs (euro, 2002 values) and incremental cost effectiveness. The treatment costs (hospital stay, physician services, drug administration) and costs incurred due to complications (pulmonary embolism, recurrent DVT, bleeding events, thrombocytopenia and deaths) during the 3-month study period were considered for the primary analysis. Life expectancy and QALYs were considered for the secondary analysis. The study was performed in the setting of the Spanish National Health System. RESULTS: Bemiparin plus OAC or long-term bemiparin for 3 months provided net cost savings of euro 769 and euro 908 per patient, respectively, compared with UFH plus OAC (UFH plus OAC euro 4128 vs bemiparin plus OAC euro 3359 vs long-term bemiparin euro 3220). Bemiparin plus OAC and long-term bemiparin for 3 months were calculated to avoid 27 and 7 additional VTE events, respectively, per 1000 patients treated. Bemiparin plus OAC or long-term bemiparin increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by approximately 1.72 and 0.74 years, respectively, compared with UFH plus OAC. The univariate sensitivity analysis supported the cost effectiveness of bemiparin in all the ranges tested for complications and costs. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that bemiparin plus OAC or long-term bemiparin for 3 months may be dominant strategies over UFH plus OAC in the treatment of DVT from the Spanish National Health System perspective, offering better outcomes and cost savings.

3721,Evaluation of the cost effectiveness of sirolimus versus tacrolimus for immunosuppression following renal transplantation in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: Immunosuppressive therapy is required to prevent graft rejection. Calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus are paradoxically toxic to the kidney, whereas sirolimus (rapamycin; Rapamune) is not generally associated with the nephrotoxicity of CNIs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative cost utility of sirolimus versus tacrolimus for the primary prevention of graft rejection in renal transplant recipients in the UK. METHODS: A stochastic simulation model was constructed using clinical trial and observational data comparing the two treatments. Time duration was up to 20 years. Costs were from a UK NHS perspective, valued at 2003 prices and discounted at 6%. Benefits were discounted at 1.5%. Simulated events included patient and graft survival, haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, re-transplants and acute rejection. Costs were summed for events and various maintenance therapies. Utility was differentially accredited depending upon survival and using the alternative renal replacement therapies. Outcome was predicted using post-transplant creatinine levels up to 3 years. Extensive statistical economic and sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Over the 10-year horizon, sirolimus gained 0.72 years (discounted) of functioning graft over tacrolimus, resulting in an incremental cost per year of functioning graft that was dominant. Over a 20-year time horizon, the cost effectiveness of sirolimus over tacrolimus further improved with an average discounted gain in years of a functioning graft of 1.8 years, resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio that was also dominant. The number of haemodialysis events was 48,243 for sirolimus recipients versus 127,829 for those receiving tacrolimus and peritoneal dialysis events 40,872 versus 105,249, respectively. Similar values were obtained when real-life observational data on tacrolimus use in Cardiff, Wales were entered into the model. Using data from Cardiff, sirolimus remained dominant over tacrolimus under all scenarios. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that sirolimus may be more cost effective than tacrolimus for the primary prevention of graft rejection in renal transplant recipients in the UK. Sirolimus was economically 'dominant' under almost all scenarios investigated. This finding was robust using statistical economic analysis and univariate sensitivity analysis.",2006-01-02821,16445304,Pharmacoeconomics,Phil McEwan,2006,24 / 1,67-79,Yes,16445304,"Phil McEwan; Simon Dixon; Keshwar Baboolal; Pete Conway; Craig J Currie; Evaluation of the cost effectiveness of sirolimus versus tacrolimus for immunosuppression following renal transplantation in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(1):1179-2027; 67-79",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with sirolimus,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,6.00,1.50,-27047,United Kingdom,2003,-62188.55
3722,Cost-effectiveness and net benefit of enhanced treatment of depression for older adults with diabetes and depression,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness and net benefit of a depression collaborative care program compared with usual care for patients with diabetes and depression. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This article describes a preplanned subgroup analysis of patients with diabetes from the Improving Mood-Promoting Access to Collaborative (IMPACT) randomized controlled trial. The setting for the study included 18 primary care clinics from eight health care organizations in five states. A total of 418 of 1,801 patients randomized to the IMPACT intervention (n = 204) versus usual care (n = 214) had coexisting diabetes. A depression care manager offered education, behavioral activation, and a choice of problem-solving treatment or support of antidepressant management by the primary care physician. The main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness and net benefit of the program compared with usual care. RESULTS: Relative to usual care, intervention patients experienced 115 (95% CI 72-159) more depression-free days over 24 months. Total outpatient costs were 25 dollars (95% CI -1,638 to 1,689) higher during this same period. The incremental cost per depression-free day was 25 cents (-14 dollars to 15 dollars) and the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ranged from 198 dollars (144-316) to 397 dollars (287-641). An incremental net benefit of 1,129 dollars (692-1,572) was found. CONCLUSIONS: The IMPACT intervention is a high-value investment for older adults with diabetes; it is associated with high clinical benefits at no greater cost than usual care.",2006-01-02824,16443871,Diabetes Care,Wayne Katon,2006,29 / 2,265-70,No,16443871,"Wayne Katon; Jürgen Unützer; Ming-Yu Fan; John W Williams; Michael Schoenbaum; Elizabeth H B Lin; Enid M Hunkeler; Cost-effectiveness and net benefit of enhanced treatment of depression for older adults with diabetes and depression, Diabetes Care, 2006-Feb; 29(2):0149-5992; 265-70",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Depression collaboration care program,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2004,Not Stated
3723,The impact of patient preferences on the cost-effectiveness of intensive glucose control in older patients with new-onset diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: Cost-effectiveness analyses have reported that intensive glucose control is not cost-effective in older patients with new-onset diabetes. However, these analyses have had limited data on patient preferences concerning diabetic health states. We examined how the cost- effectiveness of intensive glucose control changes with the incorporation of patient preferences. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We collected health state preferences/utilities from 519 older diabetic patients. We incorporated these utilities into an established cost-effectiveness model of intensive glucose control and compared incremental cost-effectiveness analyses ratios (ICERs) (cost divided by quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) when using the original and patient-derived utilities for complications and treatments. RESULTS: The mean utilities were approximately 0.40 for major complications, 0.76 (95% CI 0.74-0.78) for conventional glucose control, 0.77 (0.75-0.80) for intensive therapy with oral medications, and 0.64 (0.61-0.67) for intensive therapy with insulin. Incorporating our patient-derived complication utilities alone improved ICERs for intensive glucose control (e.g., patients aged 60-65 years at diagnosis, 136,000 dollars/QALY-->78,000 dollars/QALY), but intensive therapy was still not cost-effective at older ages. When patient-derived treatment utilities were also incorporated, the cost-effectiveness of intensive treatment depended on the method of glucose control. Intensive control with insulin generated fewer QALYs than conventional control. However, intensive control with oral medications was beneficial on average at all ages and had an ICER < or =100,000 dollars to age 70.

3730,Heller myotomy vs Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication: cost-utility analysis of a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: The addition of a Dor antireflux procedure reduces the risk of pathologic gastroesophageal reflux (GER) by ninefold following laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia. It is not clear, however, how these benefits compare with the increased cost of the fundoplication. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication compared with Heller alone in patients with achalasia. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using the Markov simulation model to examine the two treatment alternatives. The model estimated the total expected costs of each strategy over a 10-year time horizon. Data for the model were derived from our randomized clinical trial. The strategies were compared using the method of incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of pathologic GER was 47.6% (10 of 21 patients) in the Heller group and 9.1% (2 of 22 patients) in the Heller plus Dor group using an intention-to-treat analysis (p = 0.005). Heller plus Dor was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of GERD (relative risk 0.11; 95% confidence interval 0.02-0.59; p = 0.01). The cost of surgery was significantly higher for Heller plus Dor than for Heller alone (mean difference $942; p = 0.04), secondary to a longer operating room time (mean difference 40 min; p = 0.01). At a time horizon of 10 years, when proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy costs are considered, the cost-utility analysis demonstrates that Heller plus Dor surgery is associated with a total cost of $6,861 per patient and a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 9.9 years, whereas Heller-alone surgery is associated with a cost of $9,541 per patient and a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 9.5 years. CONCLUSIONS: In achalasia patients, Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication is preferred to Heller alone because it is both more effective in preventing postoperative GERD and more cost-effective at a time horizon of 10 years.",2006-01-02830,16437281,Surg Endosc,A Torquati,2006,20 / 3,389-93,No,16437281,"A Torquati; R Lutfi; L Khaitan; K W Sharp; W O Richards; Heller myotomy vs Heller myotomy plus Dor fundoplication: cost-utility analysis of a randomized trial, Surg Endosc, 2006-Mar; 20(3):1432-2218; 389-93",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy plus Dor fundoplication,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-6700,United States,2004,-9179.64
3731,Is a target culture in health care always compatible with efficient use of resources? A cost-effectiveness analysis of an intervention to achieve thrombolysis targets,"BACKGROUND: The UK government has attempted to improve the quality of health care in the National Health Service and minimize geographical variations in quality by imposing targets in certain areas of health care. The measures taken by local health economies to achieve these targets have not before been subjected to cost-effectiveness analysis. We have assessed the cost effectiveness of an intervention designed to achieve thrombolysis time targets. METHODS: In the setting of a single district general hospital in England, we audited local pain-to-needle (PTN) and door-to-needle (DTN) times, before and after a pounds 208,000 (Euro 310,000, dollar 370,000) annual expenditure to improve performance against government targets. The intervention included the recruitment of additional nursing time in the Accident & Emergency Department and the use of a single bolus thrombolytic agent for all patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction. An economic evaluation was performed, based on the expected number of additional lives saved, extrapolated from a meta-analysis of previous thrombolysis trials. RESULTS: The intervention reduced mean DTN time from 37.6 +/- 5.9 minutes (mean +/- SEM) to 27.6 +/- 3.6 minutes (p = 0.06). The cost per life saved was pounds 3,423 +/- 850 (Euro 5,100,000, dollar 6,100,000), the cost per life year gained was pounds 222,184 (Euro 330,000, dollar 390,000) and the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was pounds 246,871 (Euro 370,000, dollar 440,000). CONCLUSION: Although moderately successful at improving performance against government targets, this intervention to promote rapid thrombolysis proved to be an inefficient use of health-care resources.

3732,Patient-centred and professional-directed implementation strategies for diabetes guidelines: a cluster-randomized trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis,"AIMS: Economic evaluations of diabetes interventions do not usually include analyses on effects and cost of implementation strategies. This leads to optimistic cost-effectiveness estimates. This study reports empirical findings on the cost-effectiveness of two implementation strategies compared with usual hospital outpatient care. It includes both patient-related and intervention-related cost. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a clustered-randomized controlled trial design, 13 Dutch general hospitals were randomly assigned to a control group, a professional-directed or a patient-centred implementation programme. Professionals received feedback on baseline data, education and reminders. Patients in the patient-centred group received education and diabetes passports. A validated probabilistic Dutch diabetes model and the UKPDS risk engine are used to compute lifetime disease outcomes and cost in the three groups, including uncertainties. RESULTS: Glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) at 1 year (the measure used to predict diabetes outcome changes over a lifetime) decreased by 0.2% in the professional-change group and by 0.3% in the patient-centred group, while it increased by 0.2% in the control group. Costs of primary implementation were < 5 Euro per head in both groups, but average lifetime costs of improved care and longer life expectancy rose by 9389 Euro and 9620 Euro, respectively. Life expectancy improved by 0.34 and 0.63 years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) by 0.29 and 0.59. Accordingly, the incremental cost per QALY was 32 218 Euro for professional-change care and 16 353 for patient-centred care compared with control, and 881 Euro for patient-centred vs. professional-change care. Uncertainties are presented in acceptability curves: above 65 Euro per annum the patient-directed strategy is most likely the optimum choice. CONCLUSION: Both guideline implementation strategies in secondary care are cost-effective compared with current care, by Dutch standards, for these patients. Additional annual costs per patient using patient passports are low.

RESULTS: Glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) at 1 year (the measure used to predict diabetes outcome changes over a lifetime) decreased by 0.2% in the professional-change group and by 0.3% in the patient-centred group, while it increased by 0.2% in the control group.

3734,Patient-centred and professional-directed implementation strategies for diabetes guidelines: a cluster-randomized trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis,"AIMS: Economic evaluations of diabetes interventions do not usually include analyses on effects and cost of implementation strategies. This leads to optimistic cost-effectiveness estimates. This study reports empirical findings on the cost-effectiveness of two implementation strategies compared with usual hospital outpatient care. It includes both patient-related and intervention-related cost. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a clustered-randomized controlled trial design, 13 Dutch general hospitals were randomly assigned to a control group, a professional-directed or a patient-centred implementation programme. Professionals received feedback on baseline data, education and reminders. Patients in the patient-centred group received education and diabetes passports. A validated probabilistic Dutch diabetes model and the UKPDS risk engine are used to compute lifetime disease outcomes and cost in the three groups, including uncertainties. RESULTS: Glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) at 1 year (the measure used to predict diabetes outcome changes over a lifetime) decreased by 0.2% in the professional-change group and by 0.3% in the patient-centred group, while it increased by 0.2% in the control group.

3735,Cost-effectiveness analysis of surgery versus conservative treatment for uncomplicated varicose veins in a randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Despite being a common procedure, the cost effectiveness of surgery for varicose veins has not been established. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out alongside a randomized clinical trial at two vascular units within National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. Some 246 patients with uncomplicated varicose veins and evidence of saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal reflux were allocated randomly to receive either conservative management or surgical treatment. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained at 24 months following randomization was calculated. RESULTS: Total NHS costs during the 2-year study period were higher for the surgically treated group (733 UK pounds) than for those who had conservative treatment (345 UK pounds). The difference in costs was statistically significant. The mean incremental health gain from surgical treatment at 24 months was 0.083 QALYs, leading to a base-case estimate of 4682 UK pounds per QALY gained. Assuming an implicit threshold maximum willingness-to-pay value of 20 000 UK pounds for a QALY, the probability of surgical treatment for varicose veins falling below this threshold value was 70 per cent. This result was found to be robust to sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: For patients with uncomplicated varicose veins and evidence of saphenofemoral or saphenopopliteal reflux, surgical treatment for varicose veins offers a modest health benefit for relatively little additional NHS cost relative to conservative treatment.",2006-01-02835,16432810,Br J Surg,J Ratcliffe,2006,93 / 2,182-6,No,16432810,"J Ratcliffe; J E Brazier; W B Campbell; S Palfreyman; J B MacIntyre; J A Michaels; Cost-effectiveness analysis of surgery versus conservative treatment for uncomplicated varicose veins in a randomized clinical trial, Br J Surg, 2006-Feb; 93(2):0007-1323; 182-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surgical treatment of varicose veins,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,24 Months,3.50,3.50,4682,United Kingdom,2002,10120.57

A Markov model was constructed to model lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of using meropenem and imipenem plus cilastatin for the treatment of severe infections in intensive care. Estimates of effectiveness, utility weights and costs were obtained from the published literature. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Estimated treatment costs for the patient cohort were pound 14,938 with meropenem and pound 15,585 with imipenem plus cilastatin. QALYs gained were 7,495 with meropenem and 7,413 with imipenem plus cilastatin. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed meropenem to be significantly less costly (-pound 636.47, 95% CI -pound 132.33 to -pound 1,140.62) and more effective (0.084, 95% CI 0.023 to 0.144).

3737,Screening for the alpha-adducin Gly460Trp variant in hypertensive patients: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that approximately 80% of hypertensive patients do not take diuretics despite their recommendation as a first-line therapy. A recent study reported that hypertensive patients with the Gly460Trp variant in the alpha-adducin gene are more likely to benefit from diuretic therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential cost effectiveness of screening for the alpha-adducin Gly460Trp variant among hypertensive patients. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov model was developed to estimate the clinical and economic outcomes comparing screening for the Gly460Trp variant to identify patients for addition of a diuretic compared to no screening and no addition of diuretic (usual care) in a hypothetical cohort of treated hypertensive patients not receiving diuretic therapy. We used a lifetime horizon and payer perspective. Cost, utility and epidemiological data were obtained from the literature. One-way, probabilistic, and scenario sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the uncertainty in the results. RESULTS: The screening strategy increased quality adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.14 (95% confidence range [CR]: 0.05, 0.36) and saved dollar 1834 (dollar 505, dollar 5174) compared to usual care. The most influential input was the strength of the interaction between the alpha-adducin gene variant and diuretic effect.

3739,One-year cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment of morbid obesity: vertical banded gastroplasty versus Lap-Band,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed as an economic evaluation alongside a randomized clinical trial. The object of this study was to evaluate the 1-year cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment of morbid obesity comparing two operations. METHODS: 100 patients were assigned randomly to vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) or Lap-Band surgery. Both medical and non-medical costs were identified and measured. Costs data were combined with percentage Excess Weight Loss (%EWL) and with Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) to obtain cost per %EWL and cost per QALY ratios. RESULTS: At 1 year, the total costs were not significantly different between both groups (95% confidence interval E5,999-E1,765). Also, the QALY gain after surgery was not significantly different between the two groups. However, %EWL was significantly higher in the VBG group compared to the Lap-Band group, P-value .0001. The estimated incremental cost per %EWL was E105.83 (E1,885.91/-17.82). For the costs per QALY, the estimated ratio was dominant. The overall mortality in this study was 2%. 2 patients in the VBG group died within 30 days after surgery; 1 of these deaths was possibly related to the VBG procedure. CONCLUSION: At 1 year after surgery, the costs and QoL of the two treatment modalities were found to be equal. Therefore, the selection of the procedure can be based on the clinical aspects, effectivity and safety at 1 year. In addition, the results of a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis (e.g. with a follow-up of 36 months) planned in the future can also be helpful in the selection of the preferred treatment.",2006-01-02842,16417762,Obes Surg,Ghislaine A P G van Mastrigt,2006,16 / 1,75-84,No,16417762,"Ghislaine A P G van Mastrigt; Francois M H van Dielen; Johan L Severens; Gemma B W E Voss; Jan W Greve; One-year cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment of morbid obesity: vertical banded gastroplasty versus Lap-Band, Obes Surg, 2006-Jan; 16(1):0960-8923; 75-84",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lap-Band surgery,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-37720,Euro,1999,-62422.85
3740,The impact of home nocturnal hemodialysis on end-stage renal disease therapies: a decision analysis,"Home nocturnal hemodialysis (HNHD) is cost-effective relative to in-center hemodialysis (IHD) in short-run analyses. The effect in long-run analyses, when technique failures, declining benefits, delayed training, transplantation and death are considered, is unknown. We used decision analysis techniques to examine the relative cost-effectiveness of HNHD and IHD, projecting future costs and health effects over a lifetime with end-stage renal disease. We developed a Markov state-transition model comparing two strategies: only IHD or starting on IHD and subsequently transferring to HNHD. The model incorporates transplantation. In the base case, half the population was eligible for transplantation, with (1/3) of grafts from live donors. The time to transplant was 0.75 years for live and 5 years for deceased donor transplants. The delay before initiation of HNHD was 5 years. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Model parameters were derived from a literature review. We also conducted one-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations. The HNHD strategy was associated with a quality-adjusted survival estimate of 5.79 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with lifetime costs of $538 094. The values for IHD were 5.31 QALYs and $543 602, respectively. Thus, HNHD is cost saving while improving quality of life. The incremental cost-utility ratio was consistently less than $50 000 per QALY in sensitivity and Monte Carlo analyses. Important determinants of cost-effectiveness were transplantation time and whether benefits declined over time. Our model suggests that HNHD improves quality-adjusted survival over IHD at an economically attractive cost-effectiveness ratio.",2006-01-02849,16407887,Kidney Int,P A McFarlane,2006,69 / 5,798-805,No,16407887,"P A McFarlane; A M Bayoumi; A Pierratos; D A Redelmeier; The impact of home nocturnal hemodialysis on end-stage renal disease therapies: a decision analysis, Kidney Int, 2006-Mar; 69(5):0085-2538; 798-805",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Home Nocturnal Hemodialysis (HNHD),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-11475,Canada,2003,-11554.9
3741,Incremental cost-effectiveness of a collaborative care intervention for panic disorder,"BACKGROUND: Panic disorder is a prevalent, often disabling, disorder among primary-care patients, but there are large gaps in quality of treatment in primary care. This study describes the incremental cost-effectiveness of a combined cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy intervention for patients with panic disorder versus usual primary-care treatment. METHOD: This randomized control trial recruited 232 primary-care patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder from March 2000 to March 2002 from six primary-care clinics from university-affiliated clinics at the University of Washington (Seattle) and University of California (Los Angeles and San Diego). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either treatment as usual or a combined CBT and pharmacotherapy intervention for panic disorder delivered in primary care by a mental health therapist. Intervention patients had up to six sessions of CBT modified for the primary-care setting in the first 12 weeks, and up to six telephone follow-ups over the next 9 months. The primary outcome variables were total out-patient costs, anxiety-free days (AFDs) and quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Relative to usual care, intervention patients experienced 60.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) 42.9-77.9] more AFDs over a 12-month period. Total incremental out-patient costs were 492 US dollars higher (95% CI 236-747 US dollars ) in intervention versus usual care patients with a cost per additional AFD of 8.40 US dollars (95% CI 2.80-14.0 US dollars ) and a cost per QALY ranging from 14,158 US dollars (95% CI 6,791-21,496 US dollars ) to 24,776 US dollars (95% CI 11,885-37,618 US dollars ).

The secondary outcome measures were total hospital costs, quality of life, postoperative morbidity, and mortality. Hospital costs consisted of the cost of hospital admission or admissions and outpatient costs.The difference in intensive care readmission between the two groups of 1.13% was very small and not significantly different (p = .241; 95% confidence interval, -0.9% to 2.9%). The total hospital stay (p = .807; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to -0.4) and postoperative morbidity were comparable between the groups. The SSIC group's quality of life improved more compared with the control group's quality of life (p = .0238; 95% confidence interval, 0.0012 to 0.0464). The total hospital costs for SSIC were significantly lower (95% confidence interval, -1,581 to -174) compared with those for the control group (4,625 and 5,441, respectively). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost/delta quality-adjusted life months) thus showed the dominance of SSIC. Bootstrap and sensitivity analyses confirm the robustness of the study findings.Compared with usual care, SSIC is a safe and cost-effective approach.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant capecitabine from payer (UK National Health Service (NHS)) and societal perspectives. We used clinical trial data and published sources to estimate incremental direct and societal costs and gains in quality-adjusted life months (QALMs). Acquisition costs were higher for capecitabine than 5-FU/LV, but higher 5-FU/LV administration costs resulted in 57% lower chemotherapy costs for capecitabine.

Societal costs, including patient travel/time costs, were reduced by >75% with capecitabine vs 5-FU/LV (cost savings pound1318), with lifetime gain in QALMs of 9 months. Medical resource utilisation is significantly decreased with capecitabine vs 5-FU/LV, with cost savings to the NHS and society. Capecitabine is also projected to increase life expectancy vs 5-FU/LV. Cost savings and better outcomes make capecitabine a preferred adjuvant therapy for Dukes' C colon cancer.

3748,Socioeconomic costs of open surgery and gamma knife radiosurgery for benign cranial base tumors,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative socioeconomic costs of benign cranial base tumors treated with open surgery and gamma knife radiosurgery.In a retrospective study, we studied 174 patients with benign cranial base tumors, less than 3 cm in diameter (or volume less than 30 ml), admitted in the past 5 years. Group A (n = 94) underwent open surgery for removal of the tumors, whereas Group B (n = 80) underwent gamma knife radiosurgery. The socioeconomic costs were evaluated by both direct and indirect cost. The direct costs comprised intensive care unit cost, ward cost, operating room cost, and outpatient visiting cost. The indirect costs included loss of workdays and mortality. The length of hospital stay, the number of lost workdays, surgical complications, mortality, and cost-effectiveness analysis were calculated as well. Student t test and chi test were used for statistical analysis.The mean length of hospital stay for open surgery was 18.2 +/- 30.4 days including 5.0 +/- 14.7 days of intensive care unit stay and 13.0 +/- 15.2 days of ward stay, P < 0.01.

3750,Cost-effectiveness of hypothetical new cancer drugs in patients with advanced small-cell lung cancer: results of a markov chain model,"In the last decade, a number of new treatment modalities have been developed for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The clinical effects are encouraging, but little is known about the costs and cost-effectiveness of new drugs.A Markov chain model has been developed to project patient outcomes and costs for patients with advanced SCLC. All patients in the control group were treated with etoposide-cisplatin chemotherapy. Patients in the study group received a hypothetical new drug. The model consisted of four states: response, stable disease, progressive disease, and death. Estimates of transition probabilities were calculated using published data on survival and recurrence-free survival. For the cost analysis and utility calculation, published data and expert opinion were used as sources. The duration of the follow-up was maximal 2 years.The total treatment costs in the etoposide-cisplatin group amounted to euro16 038 and in the alternative treatment groups between euro16 644 and euro18 171. The number of life years and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were very small, around 16 days. The cost-effectiveness ratio varied between euro22 208 and euro81 443 and the cost-utility ratio varied accordingly. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust in favor of etoposide-cisplatin treatment.SCLC is an illness with a poor prognosis which needed substantial healthcare resources to optimise patient survival and overall quality of life.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether most psoriasis treatments lie within the accepted range of cost-utility.32 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis were administered the Euro-Qol 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) survey to calculate their health state utility. Economic modeling was performed with a range of therapeutic costs applying the calculated utility score. Paired t-tests were used to calculate significance.At the conclusion of 2 weeks of therapy, the mean psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) improved 35% to 7.2 (p<0.001). The mean health state utility score on the EQ-5D improved 11.5% from 77.7 units before therapy to 86.7 units after therapy (p=0.007).A therapy that achieves at least a PASI 35 would be considered cost-effective by conventional standards if it does not exceed $33 600 in cost.",2006-01-12898,18360608,Ther Clin Risk Manag,Stefan C Weiss,2006,2 / 3,325-8,No,18360608,"Stefan C Weiss; Wingfield Rehmus; Alexa B Kimball; An assessment of the cost-utility of therapy for psoriasis, Ther Clin Risk Manag, ; 2(3):1178-203X; 325-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Topical therapy (clobetasol cream/foam) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,35700.33,United States,2004,48912.85

3754,A cost-utility analysis of open and endoscopic carpal tunnel release,"Open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) is the standard procedure for the surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. With the advent of minimally invasive surgery, endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) was introduced.To use a decision analytical model to compare ECTR with OCTR in an economic evaluation.Direct medical costs were obtained from a Canadian university hospital. Utility values obtained from experts, presented with carpal tunnel syndrome outcome health states, were transformed into quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The probabilities of the health states associated with both techniques were obtained from the literature.The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was $124,311.32/QALY gained, providing strong evidence to reject ECTR when ECTR is performed in the main operating room and OCTR is performed in the day surgery unit. A one-way sensitivity analysis in the present study demonstrated that when both OCTR and ECTR are performed in day surgery unit, the ICUR falls in the 'win-win' quadrant, making ECTR both more effective and less costly than OCTR. If the scar tenderness probability is decreased in the ECTR group in a second one-way sensitivity analysis, the ICUR decreases to $100,621.91/QALY gained, providing evidence to reject ECTR. If the reflex sympathetic dystrophy probability is increased in the ECTR group in a third one-way sensitivity analysis, the ICUR increases to $202,657.88/QALY gained, providing strong evidence to reject ECTR.There is still uncertainty associated with the costs and effectiveness of ECTR and OCTR. To obtain a definitive answer as to whether the ECTR is more effective than the OCTR, it is necessary to perform a large, randomized, controlled trial in which the utilities and resource use are measured prospectively.",2006-01-12902,19554224,Can J Plast Surg,Achilleas Thoma,2006,14 / 1,15-20,No,19554224,"Achilleas Thoma; Vanessa H Wong; Sheila Sprague; Eric Duku; A cost-utility analysis of open and endoscopic carpal tunnel release, Can J Plast Surg, ; 14(1):1195-2199; 15-20",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endoscopic carpel tunnel release vs. Open carpal tunnel release,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,124311.32,Canada,2003,125176.88
3755,Individualized strategy for dosing luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists for androgen-independent prostate cancer: identification of outcomes and costs,"Continuing androgen suppression is the current standard in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). An individualized strategy, wherein luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists (LH-RHas) are redosed when serum testosterone approaches a non-castrate level, may decrease costs without worsening outcomes. To understand possible outcomes, we performed a cost-utility analysis comparing individualized and fixed LH-RHa dosing strategies in men with AIPC.The model used a societal perspective, a 5-year time horizon, and 3% annual cost discounting. The model accounted for direct costs of androgen suppression. Utilities were varied in accordance with published preference data.Under base-case assumptions, individualized LH-RHa dosing yielded 1.089 expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), compared with 1.094 expected QALYs for fixed LH-RHa dosing. In cost analysis, lifetime per-patient costs for androgen suppression were estimated to be $5,694 for individualized LH-RHa dosing and $9,157 for fixed LH-RHa dosing. Applied to the total population, a strategy of individualized LH-RHa dosing would cost $170 million for androgen suppression, compared with $274 million for fixed LH-RHa dosing. Under these assumptions, adopting the individualized strategy resulted in $692,600 gained from a societal perspective for each QALY lost (the decremental cost utility).The results suggest that an individualized LH-RHa dosing strategy would be associated with moderate savings on an individual basis but substantial savings on a population basis, and would not adversely affect quality of life or life expectancy.

3774,"Not all ""quality-adjusted life years"" are equal","BACKGROUND: There is evidence that utility elicitation methods used in the calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) yield different results. It is not clear how these differences impact economic evaluations. METHODS: Using a mathematical model incorporating data on efficacy, costs, and utility values, we simulated the experiences of 100,000 hypothetical rheumatoid arthritis patients over 10 years (50,000 exposed to infliximab plus methotrexate [MTX] and 50,000 exposed to MTX alone). QALYs, were derived from the Health Utilities Index 2 and 3 (HUI2 and HUI3), the Short Form 6-D (SF-6D), and the Euroqol 5-D (EQ-5D). Incremental cost-utility ratios were determined using each instrument to calculate QALYs and the results were compared using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Using the different utility measurement methods, the mean difference in QALYs between the infliximab plus MTX and MTX groups ranged from a high of 1.95 QALYs (95% CI=1.93-1.97) using the HUI3 to 0.89 QALYs (95% CI=0.88-0.91) using the SF-6D.

3775,Preoperative use of recombinant human erythropoietin in pediatric orthopedics: a decision model for long-term outcomes,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Spine surgery for scoliosis is associated with significant blood loss and may require blood transfusion. The risks inherent in blood transfusion have inspired interventions, including human recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO), which has emerged as a safe and effective adjunct in minimizing exposure to allogenic blood in children undergoing scoliosis surgery. However, there is little information in the literature on their economic impact on the health-care system. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rHuEPO in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: We designed a decision analytic model capturing costs and potential long-term outcomes of transfusion-related complications to compare the cost-effectiveness of preoperative rHuEPO with a control group and a common alternative, preoperative autologous donation (PAD). PATIENT SAMPLE: This is a decision analytic model. Decision modeling relies on a summation of the probability of different clinical studies; no patients were specifically studied. OUTCOME MEASURES: The standard cost-effectiveness ratio (C/E) of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used as the threshold value for determining the cost-effectiveness of these two preoperative intervention strategies. METHODS: From the model we calculated the probability that a patient would experience transfusion-related complications based on the mean number of allogenic units transferred as a result of scoliosis surgery. The standard C/E of $50,000 per QALY was used as the threshold value for determining the cost-effectiveness. Some aspects of the model were derived from retrospective data from the literature. Sensitivity analyses were also conducted to discover which variables, when changed within the accepted range, caused the final result of the model to change significantly. RESULTS: Results indicated a cost per year-of-life-saved exceeding $1 million for the PAD arm and over $1.5 million for the rHuEPO arm. The low rates of transfusion in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery and the relative safety of the blood supply create a scenario where even inexpensive interventions are not cost-effective. However, rHuEPO would become cost-effective if decreased transfusion rates or higher postoperative hematocrit resulted in decreased length of stay.

DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic review of the clinical and economic literature was performed. For primary economic analysis, a decision-tree model was built based on the available information, the impact of newborn screening on the health care and the relevant Canadian data. RESULTS: Twenty-one clinical and two economic studies met the selection criteria. Mean incidence of MCADD was approximately 1:16,000. Clinical sensitivity and specificity were 100% and 99.99%, respectively. Screening significantly lowered morbidity and mortality. Both economic studies showed that screening for MCADD using MS/MS was cost-effective if willingness-to-pay was US 50,000 dollars. Our primary economic analysis showed that screening was cost-effective based on the cost-effective threshold of C 20,000 dollars per QALY.

3782,Costs and cost-effectiveness of adolescent compliance with treatment for latent tuberculosis infection: results from a randomized trial,"PURPOSE: Assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of an incentive-based tuberculosis (TB) program designed to promote adolescents' compliance with treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI). METHODS: Randomized controlled trial. Adolescents between the ages of 11 and 19 years who were referred to one of two participating clinics after being screened for TB and receiving a positive diagnosis indicating LTBI (n = 794) were assigned to one of four groups: usual care, peer counseling, contingency contracting, and combined peer counseling/contingency contracting. Primary outcome variables were completion of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), total treatment costs, and lifetime TB-related costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in each of the four study groups (three treatment, one control). Cost effectiveness was evaluated using a five-stage Markov model and a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 trials. RESULTS: Average costs were 199 dollars for usual care (UC), 277 dollars for peer counseling (PC), 326 dollars for contingency contracting (CC), and 341 dollars for PC + CC combined. The differences among these groups were all significant at the p = .001 level. Only the PC + CC group improved the rate of IPT completion (83.8%) relative to usual care (75.9%) (p = .051), with an overall incremental CE ratio of 209 dollars per QALY relative to usual care.

3783,Option appraisal of population-based colorectal cancer screening programmes in England,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and resource impact of faecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and flexible sigmoidoscopy (FSIG) screening options for colorectal cancer to inform the Department of Health's policy on bowel cancer screening in England. METHODS: We developed a state transition model to simulate the life experience of a cohort of individuals without polyps or cancer through to the development of adenomatous polyps and malignant carcinoma and subsequent death in the general population of England. The costs, effects and resource impact of five screening options were evaluated: (a) FOBT for individuals aged 50-69 (biennial screening); (b) FOBT for individuals aged 60-69 (biennial screening); (c) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 55; (d) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 60; and (e) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 60, followed by FOBT for individuals aged 61-70 (biennial screening). RESULTS: The model suggests that screening using FSIG with or without FOBT may be cost-saving and may produce additional benefits compared with a policy of no screening. The marginal cost-effectiveness of FOBT options compared to a policy of no screening is estimated to be below pound3000 per quality adjusted life year gained.

The costs, effects and resource impact of five screening options were evaluated: (a) FOBT for individuals aged 50-69 (biennial screening); (b) FOBT for individuals aged 60-69 (biennial screening); (c) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 55; (d) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 60; and (e) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 60, followed by FOBT for individuals aged 61-70 (biennial screening). RESULTS: The model suggests that screening using FSIG with or without FOBT may be cost-saving and may produce additional benefits compared with a policy of no screening. The marginal cost-effectiveness of FOBT options compared to a policy of no screening is estimated to be below pound3000 per quality adjusted life year gained.

3788,A non-randomised controlled trial of the clinical and cost effectiveness of a Supervised Exercise Programme for claudication,"OBJECTIVES: The main aims of treatment in patients with intermittent claudication (IC) are to improve the clinical indicators of lower limb ischaemia and patients' quality of life (QoL). The aims of this study were assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a supervised exercise programme (SEP) in patients with IC. DESIGN: Non-randomised, controlled trial. SETTING: University teaching hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two groups of patients with IC were studied. Seventy patients were sequentially recruited before and after the establishment of a Supervised Exercise Programme at our unit. Thirty-seven patients (median age 69 years, 26 men) received conservative medical therapy (CMT) and 33 patients (median age 67 years, 22 men) received CMT plus a 3 month SEP of graduated physical exercise for sixty minutes, three times each week. Patients were assessed prior to and at 6 months following treatment. At each assessment patient reported walking distances (PRWD), treadmill claudication and maximal distances (ICD and MWD), ankle brachial pressure indices (ABPI) pre & post exercise and patient reported QoL using the SF36 questionnaire were assessed. RESULTS: Prior to intervention the two groups were well matched. Following treatment, CMT patients demonstrated no significant change in PRWD or ICD but did record a small but significant improvement in MWD. CMT was also associated with a negative effect size in the SF36 index and in 7 of the 8 SF36 QoL domains, effect size >-0.5 for the domains of Physical Function and Emotional Role. SEP patients demonstrated significant improvement in PRWD, ICD and MWD. SEP was associated with a positive effect size in the SF36 index and in 2 SF36 QoL domains but a negative effect size in a further 2 domains. However, all QoL effect sizes following SEP were < +/-0.5. Intergroup differences in effect sizes were >0.5 for the SF36 domains of Physical Function, Physical Role, Emotion Role and SF36 index. SEP resulted in a 0.027 quality adjusted life year (QALY) gain over CMT in the first year post-treatment thus the cost/QALY gained of SEP is pound1780 at 1 year.

3789,Health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of aprepitant in outpatients receiving antiemetic prophylaxis for highly emetogenic chemotherapy in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains a major adverse effect of cancer therapy. We aimed to determine outcomes associated with use of aprepitant in outpatients undergoing highly emetogenic chemotherapy in Germany from a patient's and payer's perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic model compared an aprepitant regimen (aprepitant/ondansetron/dexamethasone) to a control regimen (ondansetron/dexamethasone) over a five days period. Clinical results and resource utilisation observed in aprepitant phase III clinical trials were assigned German unit cost data. RESULTS: Complete response over one chemotherapy cycle was observed in 68% of patients in the aprepitant group (N=514) compared to 48% of patients in the control group (N=518). Patients were estimated to have gained an equivalent of 15 additional hours of perfect health per cycle (0.63 quality-adjusted life days) with aprepitant-based regimen compared to control regimen. Cost per quality-adjusted life year gained with aprepitant was estimated at euro28,891.

3790,Is shared care with annual hospital review better value for money than predominantly hospital-based care in patients with established stable rheumatoid arthritis?,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness and cost effectiveness acceptability of symptom control delivered by shared care (SCSC) and aggressive treatment delivered in hospital (ATH) for established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Economic data were collected within the British Rheumatoid Outcome Study Group randomised controlled trial of SCSC and ATH. A broad perspective was used (UK National Health Service, social support services and patients). Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, net benefit statistics and cost effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. Sensitivity analysis tested the robustness of the results to analytical assumptions. RESULTS: The mean (SD) cost per person was 4540 pounds (4700) in the SCSC group and 4440 pounds (4900) in the ATH group. The mean (SD) QALYs per person for 3 years were 1.67 (0.56) in the SCSC group and 1.60 (0.60) in the ATH group. If decision makers are prepared to pay > or = 2000 pounds to gain 1 QALY, SCSC is likely to be cost effective in 60-90% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The primary economic analysis and sensitivity analyses indicate that SCSC is likely to be more cost effective than ATH in 60-90% of cases. This result seems to be robust to assumptions required by the analysis. This study is one of a limited number of randomised controlled trials to collect detailed resource use and health status data and estimate the costs and QALYs of treatment for established RA.

3791,Cost-effectiveness of intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase within a 3-hour window after acute ischemic stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of intravenous thrombolysis treatment with alteplase (Actilyse) of acute ischemic stroke with 24-hour in-house neurology coverage and use of magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: A health economic model was designed to calculate the marginal cost-effectiveness ratios for time spans of 1, 2, 3 and 30 years. Effect data were extracted from a meta-analysis of six large-scale randomized and placebo-controlled studies of thrombolytic therapy with alteplase. Cost data were extracted from thrombolysis treatment at Aarhus Hospital, Denmark, and from previously published literature. RESULTS: The calculated cost-effectiveness ratio after the first year was $55,591 US per quality-adjusted life-year (base case). After the second year, computation of the cost-effectiveness ratio showed that thrombolysis was cost-effective. The long-term computations (30 years) showed that thrombolysis was a dominant strategy compared with conservative treatment given the model premises. CONCLUSIONS: A high-quality thrombolysis treatment with 24-hour in-house neurology coverage and magnetic resonance imaging might not be cost-effective in the short term compared with conservative treatment.

3792,The long-term cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator,"AIMS: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT-P) is an effective treatment for patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony with moderate or severe symptoms despite pharmacological therapy. The addition of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) function may further reduce the risk of sudden death. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of CRT-P compared with medical therapy (MT) alone, and the cost-effectiveness of CRT-ICD + MT compared with CRT-P + MT, on incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and life year using data from two landmark clinical trials. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation to assess costs, life years, and QALYs associated with CRT (+/- ICD) and MT in patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony, on the basis of a UK healthcare perspective was constructed. NYHA class distribution and transitions, associated health utilities, rates and cause of hospitalization and death were estimated from individual patient data from the CArdiac REsychronization in Heart Failure (CARE-HF trial). The estimated additional benefit on survival of an ICD was based on results from COMPANION. The base case analysis used 10 000 individual life-time simulations assuming a battery life of 6 years for CRT-P and 7 years for CRT-ICD. From a life-time perspective in a 65-year-old patient, the incremental cost-effectiveness of CRT-P compared with MT is 7538 euros (95% CI 5325-11,784 euros) per QALY gained and 7011euros (95% CI 5346-10,003 euros) per life year gained.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation to assess costs, life years, and QALYs associated with CRT (+/- ICD) and MT in patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony, on the basis of a UK healthcare perspective was constructed. NYHA class distribution and transitions, associated health utilities, rates and cause of hospitalization and death were estimated from individual patient data from the CArdiac REsychronization in Heart Failure (CARE-HF trial). The estimated additional benefit on survival of an ICD was based on results from COMPANION. The base case analysis used 10 000 individual life-time simulations assuming a battery life of 6 years for CRT-P and 7 years for CRT-ICD. From a life-time perspective in a 65-year-old patient, the incremental cost-effectiveness of CRT-P compared with MT is 7538 euros (95% CI 5325-11,784 euros) per QALY gained and 7011euros (95% CI 5346-10,003 euros) per life year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness of CRT-ICD compared with CRT-P is 47,909 euros (95% CI 35,703-79,438 euros) per QALY gained, and 35,864 euros (95% CI 26,709-56,353 euros) per life year gained. CONCLUSION: Long-term treatment with CRT-P appears cost-effective compared with MT alone. From a life-time perspective, assuming a reasonable life expectancy when receiving effective treatment for heart failure, CRT-ICD may also be considered cost-effective when compared with CRT-P + MT.",2007-01-02351,17110403,Eur Heart J,Guiqing Yao,2007,28 / 1,42-51,No,17110403,"Guiqing Yao; Nick Freemantle; Melanie J Calvert; Stirling Bryan; Jean-Claude Daubert; John G F Cleland; Nick Freemantle; Melanie J Calvert; Stirling Bryan; Jean-Claude Daubert; John G F Cleland; The long-term cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy with or without an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, Eur Heart J, 2007-Jan; 28(1):0195-668X; 42-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cardiac resynchronization therapy with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (CRT+ICD) + medical therapy,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,55578,Euro,2005,91686.99
