1601,Modelling the costs and effects of leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis,"This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of leflunomide (LEF) compared to methotrexate (MTX) and sulfasalazine (SSZ) in the United Kingdom. A Markov model was constructed using health states defined by Health Assessment Questionnaire score. The model is based on a cohort of patients with recently diagnosed definite RA who were followed for up to 15 years at nine rheumatology clinics in the UK. The treatment effect was calculated based on clinical trials comparing LEF to MTX (one international and one United States trial) and to SSZ (one international trial). Transitions between health states for the first 2 years of treatment were calculated from the clinical trials, while the extrapolation beyond the trial was based on the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Study cohort, using an ordered probit model. This makes it possible to predict transitions for patients with similar characteristics (age, time since disease onset) as in the trials. Separate analyses were performed for each trial, and all analyses covered a 10-year timeframe. Using the US trial, LEF had slightly lower costs and better effects (44,017 and 4.307 pounds QALYs, compared to 44,988 and 4.158 pounds QALYs for MTX), while for the international trial this was reversed (34,070 and 4.487 pounds QALYs for MTX compared to 36,351 and 4.372 pounds QALYs for LEF). Compared to SSZ, the cost of using LEF was slightly lower, with an increase in QALYs (35,855 and 3.896 pounds QALYs compared to 36,731 and 3.721 pounds QALYs for SSZ). The two trials comparing LEF to MTX gave differing results. One possible reason for this is that MTX patients in the US trial were given folic acid, whereas in the international trial folate supplementation was not mandated. This may have reduced the effectiveness of MTX. In the UK it is standard practice to use folic acid with MTX, and therefore the results from the US trial may be more relevant for the UK. Compared to SSZ, the use of LEF appears to be cost-effective in the UK.",2002-01-00070,15609143,Eur J Health Econ,Gisela Kobelt,2002,3 / 3,180-7,Yes,15609143,"Gisela Kobelt; Peter Lindgren; A Young; Modelling the costs and effects of leflunomide in rheumatoid arthritis, Eur J Health Econ, 2002-Sep; 3(3):1618-7598; 180-7",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with leflunomide vs. Treatment with sulfasalazine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,6.00,1.50,-5005.71,United Kingdom,2000,-11402.28

1604,Disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Identifying the cost-utility of riluzole by disease stage,"This study reports the results of a long-term economic evaluation of riluzole in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) versus best supportive care in the United Kingdom. The analysis included in this contribution aims to provide an update of the determination of the phase of the disease that is prolonged by riluzole and also to assess the quality of the life extension offered by riluzole by taking into account the patients"" utility score. Specifically, the analysis provides a more specific estimate of the cost-utility of riluzole dependent disease stage, thereby providing a useful insight of the cost-effectiveness of therapy. A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of riluzole versus best supportive care. Transition possibilities and the distribution of patients by health states were taken from a cohort of 954 patients drawn from a large randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial between 1992 and 1994. Costs associated with riluzole included the acquisition cost and bi-monthly monitoring for raised ALT levels. Patient assessed utilities were collected by use of the SG technique from two centres (King""s, London and Preston) in the UK. Four distinct health states were used corresponding to mild, moderate, severe and terminal states. Applying the Markov model and extending the transitional probabilities using linear interpolation, the base case cost per life year gained was estimated at pound15,192 while applying Standard Gamble utility scores, the base case cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was assessed at pound22,086. Carrying out a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost per QALY was estimated at pound22,236 with standard deviation of pound612. The results of the long-term analysis also show that riluzole on average increases survival in ALS patients by 6 months with approximately 5 months of the additional life gained in the early disease states, of which 4 months is spent in disease state 2, where quality of life is relatively high. However, the model is sensitive in the way in which the long-term transitional probabilities are estimated. Using averages of the first nine cycles, the cost per QALY would increase to pound33,420 with standard deviation of pound972. Thus, this analysis highlights some of the difficulties associated with extending the short clinical effectiveness data; one way forward would be to obtain long-term observations data for both groups.",2002-01-00071,15609140,Eur J Health Econ,M Tavakoli,2002,3 / 3,156-65,Yes,15609140,"M Tavakoli; Disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Identifying the cost-utility of riluzole by disease stage, Eur J Health Econ, 2002-Sep; 3(3):1618-7598; 156-65",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with riluzole vs. Best supportive care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,Not Stated,20904,United Kingdom,1998,55009.53
1605,Cost-effectiveness analysis of interferon-alpha therapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although interferon-alpha has been approved for chronic hepatitis B treatment in Taiwan, the high price necessitates study of its cost-effectiveness to define its role from a burden of disease perspective. METHOD: A stimulation model was constructed to project the long-term effects of interferon treatment or standard care for a hypothetical group of 35-year-old chronic hepatitis B patients in Taiwan. Data on interferon treatment efficacy, disease progression, vital statistics, medical expenditure for various liver disease states, and quality-of-life measures based on Taiwan data were collected and used in the model. RESULTS: The model indicated that a 35-year-old chronic hepatitis B patient treated with interferon in Taiwan would have a life expectancy of 29.08 years, versus 28.67 years for the same patient who did not receive interferon. Corresponding to this gain in life expectancy of 0.41 years (or 0.18 quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 492.000 New Taiwan dollars (NT$; 14,200 US$ at 34.7 NT$/US$) per QALY with an annual 3% discount rate. Monte Carlo simulation taking into account the range of plausible values for all model parameters indicated that 95% of the ICERs were in the range of 65,000 NT$ (1.900 US$)/QALY to 683,000 NT$ (19,700 US$)/QALY, and 90% of the ICERs were below 413,000 NT$ (11,900 US$)/QALY. CONCLUSION: Interferon has a favorable cost-effectiveness profile in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in Taiwan. However, the study results cannot be interpreted in isolation and need to be compared with the cost-effectiveness profiles of treatment regimens for other major chronic diseases in Taiwan.",2002-01-00747,12645191,J Formos Med Assoc,Raoh-Fang Pwu,2002,101 / 9,632-41,No,12645191,"Raoh-Fang Pwu; K Arnold Chan; Cost-effectiveness analysis of interferon-alpha therapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in Taiwan, J Formos Med Assoc, 2002-Sep; 101(9):0929-6646; 632-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,IFN-alfa therapy of 5 MU 3x weekly for 24 weeks vs. Usual supportive care with no IFN-alfa therapy,Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,492000,Taiwan,2001,21274.14
1606,The health economics of calcium and vitamin D3 for the prevention of osteoporotic hip fractures in Sweden,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the economics of administering calcium and vitamin D3 to post-menopausal women in Sweden. We focus primarily on the cost-effectiveness of treating older women for whom clear evidence of efficacy is available. We supplement this information, however, with estimates of the cost-effectiveness of treating certain high-risk groups of younger women, while acknowledging the greater uncertainty involved. METHODS: We developed a Markov model for analyzing the occurrence and timing of hip fractures, based almost entirely on peer-reviewed data from Sweden. In a 3-year randomized clinical trial, the combination of calcium and vitamin D3 was shown to reduce the risk of hip fractures by 27%. Costs for treating hip fractures were based on 1,080 women who were hospitalized in Stockholm. RESULTS: Treatment of 70-year-old women was cost saving at efficacy as low as two-thirds that seen in the clinical trials, and upwards. Even at modest rates of efficacy, treatment of the high-risk 50- and 60-year-old cohorts was generally cost-effective and in some cases even cost saving. Particularly cost-effective was treatment of women with identified osteoporosis or a maternal family history of hip fracture. CONCLUSION: Simulation results suggest a role for lifetime treatment of older women with calcium and vitamin D3 in Sweden. While there is more uncertainty underlying the treatment of younger women, our simulation results suggest that treatment may also be cost saving or at least cost-effective for many cohorts of high-risk 50- and particularly 60-year-old women, in particular those with osteoporosis or a maternal family history of hip fracture.",2002-01-00775,12602080,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Michael S Willis,2003,18 / 4,791-807,No,12602080,"Michael S Willis; The health economics of calcium and vitamin D3 for the prevention of osteoporotic hip fractures in Sweden, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2002; 18(4):0266-4623; 791-807",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lifetime treatment of calcium and vitamin D3 vs. No treatment (not explicitly stated),Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,74000,Sweden,2000,12165.3

1613,Treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-alpha: cost-effectiveness in developing countries,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with interferon-alpha (IFN) has been shown to be cost-effective in developed countries. However, cost-effectiveness In developing countries such as India has not been studied. METHODS: Using the Markov transitional probability model, we studied two cohorts of young patients (30 years of age) with chronic hepatitis B, one untreated and the other treated with interferon (IFN), 5 million units daily for 16 weeks, with evidence of viral replication and chronic hepatitis, but not cirrhosis, and were followed up over a 30-year period. Rates of disease progression, efficacy of IFN and quality of life associated with various disease states were estimated from the available literature. Direct costs were estimated using Indian prices of IFN and from the usual costs of medical treatment in India based on expert opinion. Unrelated mortality rates were modelled on age-specific death rates of the general population. The efficacy of IFN was judged In terms of extra life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, and marginal cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. Several sensitivity analyses, both undiscounted and with discounted analyses, were done. RESULTS: At the end of the 30-year period, fewer patients in the IFN-treated group developed cirrhosis or decompensated cirrhosis, or were dead. The average life span of the treated cohort was 25.14 years, a gain of 0.6 years over the untreated cohort (24.54years). The QALY lived bythetwocohortswere 23.69 and 22.75 years, respectively, representing a gain of 0.94 years for the IFN-treated group. The cost Incurred by the IFN-treated group was Rs 300,000, and that for the untreated cohort was Rs 40 700, a substantial difference. Using the baseline estimates, undiscounted costs per year of life gained and per QALY gained were Rs 432,500 and Rs 276,900, respectively; these estimates are 20.5 and 13.1 times the per capita gross national income of the Indian population. Sensitivity analyses showed that changes in various parameters led to only minor changes in these estimates. Use of discounting led to an increase in marginal cost per life-year or QALY gained. CONCLUSION: In developing countries with a low per capita Income, IFN therapy for chronic hepatitis B may not be cost-effective. A careful consideration of cost-effectiveness is therefore essential before Instituting IFN therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B In such populations.",2002-01-00817,12540064,Natl Med J India,Rakesh Aggarwal,2002,15 / 6,320-7,No,12540064,"Rakesh Aggarwal; Uday Chand Ghoshal; Subhash R Naik; Treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-alpha: cost-effectiveness in developing countries, Natl Med J India, 2002 Nov-Dec; 15(6):0970-258X; 320-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Interferon-alpha (IFN) in a dose of 5 million units (MU) daily for 16 weeks vs. No treatment,Not Stated,30 Years,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,276900,India,2000,9255.78
1614,Cost effectiveness of adding leflunomide to a 5-year strategy of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate, from a public payer""s perspective, the 5-year cost effectiveness of adding leflunomide (LEF) to a sequence of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) representative of a typical rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management approach adopted by Canadian rheumatologists. METHODS: A DMARD sequence including LEF was compared with one excluding it, using a 5-year simulation model where patients with RA cycle through different treatment regimens. Data were obtained through a systematic literature search (drug withdrawal rates, number and type of adverse events, American College of Rheumatology 20% responder status) and separately conducted surveys (choice of DMARD sequence, management of adverse events). Costs for adverse event management were calculated using the Ontario Schedule of Benefits, and monitoring costs were calculated according to official Canadian product monograph recommendations. Wholesale prices of all drugs were adjusted by the allowable markup and prescription fees. Utilities (as measured by the standard gamble [SG] and rating scale [RS] techniques) were obtained from 482 patients who participated in a 1-year randomized controlled trial that compared LEF, methotrexate, and placebo. Costs and utilities were discounted by 3%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: Adding LEF to a conventional strategy of DMARDs increased the 5-year management costs by $1,231 compared with the strategy without LEF, which results in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,096 per additional year of response to treatment, and cost-utility ratios of $54,229 (RS) and $71,988 (SG) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSION: Adding LEF as a new option to a conventional sequence of DMARDs extends the time patients may benefit from DMARD therapy at a reasonable cost effectiveness and cost utility. LEF data are limited to clinical trials; data from observational studies would be needed to corroborate these findings.",2002-01-00831,12522841,Arthritis Rheum,Andreas Maetzel,2002,47 / 6,655-61,No,12522841,"Andreas Maetzel; Vibeke Strand; P Tugwell; George Wells; Claire Bombardier; Cost effectiveness of adding leflunomide to a 5-year strategy of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, Arthritis Rheum, 2002-Dec-15; 47(6):0004-3591; 655-61",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Leflunomide (LEF) added to conventional sequence of DMARDS (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs) vs. Conventional sequence of DMARDS (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,71988,United States,1998,114302.37
1615,"Results of an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, versus warfarin for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and associated long-term complications in total hip replacement surgery in the United States","BACKGROUND: Premature death due to pulmonary embolism is a short-term complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The long-term clinical course after DVT can be further complicated by excess mortality, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), which may produce sizable long-term economic burdens. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin versus warfarin for the universal prophylaxis of DVT and associated long-term complications in US patients undergoing total hip replacement surgery (THRS). METHODS: A model was constructed to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of the 2 treatments. Patients undergoing THRS were exposed to a short-term risk of developing a DVT. Patients surviving a DVT were exposed to increased risk of long-term complications of DVT, including PTS, recurrent VTE, and increased mortality. Published literature, augmented by expert opinion, served as input for the model""s resource use and costs for DVT prophylaxis, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of DVT, VTE, and PTS. RESULTS: When the analysis included only the short-term consequences of DVT, therapy with enoxaparin resulted in a net cost of $133 per patient and a net increase of 0.04 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient. Thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin versus warfarin resulted in $3733 per QALY saved. In contrast, when the long-term consequences of DVT were included, enoxaparin resulted in net lifetime savings of $89 per patient and net QALY benefits of 0.16 per patient. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first US economic analysis comparing DVT prophylaxis with the LMWH enoxaparin versus warfarin that included the long-term complications of DVT. Our model suggests that use of enoxaparin in patients undergoing THRS reduces the economic burden associated with these long-term complications.",2002-01-00845,12501885,Clin Ther,Marc F Botteman,2002,24 / 11,1960-86; discussion 1938,Yes,12501885,"Marc F Botteman; Joseph Caprini; Jennifer M Stephens; Vijay Nadipelli; Christopher F Bell; Chris L Pashos; Alexander T Cohen; Results of an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, versus warfarin for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis and associated long-term complications in total hip replacement surgery in the United States, Clin Ther, 2002-Nov; 24(11):1879-114X; 1960-86; discussion 1938",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Use of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) enoxaparin vs. Use of warfarin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Months,3.00,3.00,3733,United States,2000,5610.58

METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed from a third-party insurer perspective by using decision analysis, evidence-based data from the literature, and patient preference-based time trade-off utility values. DATABASE: Patient-derived time trade-off ocular utility values and the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern guidelines for the treatment of amblyopia. INTERVENTION: Treatment of childhood amblyopia using medical and surgical therapies per the American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Dollars (year 2001 nominal U.S. dollars) expended per quality-adjusted life-year ($/QALY) gained. RESULTS: Treatment for amblyopia resulted in a $/QALY gained of $2281 with a discount rate of 3% for costs and outcomes. Sensitivity analysis, varying costs and utility values by 10%, resulted in a $/QALY gained range from $2053 to $2509.

1617,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of sentinel lymph node mapping and adjuvant interferon treatment for stage II melanoma,"Clinical studies have demonstrated that high dose adjuvant interferon therapy improves disease-free and overall survival among high risk (stage IIb and III) melanoma patients. Sentinel lymph node mapping (SLM) has been shown to accurately detect micrometastasis and may be used to identify higher risk stage II patients, who might benefit most from adjuvant interferon therapy. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of first testing with SLM and then treating with adjuvant interferon (IFN) therapy for stage II melanoma. We used a decision analytical model to compare four strategies for stage II patients after surgical excision of their melanoma: (1) treat all with low dose IFN; (2) test first with SLM and then treat only those with positive micrometastasis with high dose IFN; (3) test first with SLM and treat positives with high dose IFN and negatives with low dose IFN (test and treat appropriately); and (4) surgery only. Treatment, toxicity, follow-up and relapse costs were included over a 5 year time period. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted relapse-free life year saved. Our analysis shows that, compared with the current surgery-only strategy, all three treatment strategies provide incremental benefits. The test and treat appropriately strategy is the most effective, with an incremental improvement of 0.64 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). The cost-effectiveness of test and treat some with high dose IFN compared with the surgery-only strategy is $18,700/QALY. The test and treat appropriately strategy is also cost-effective compared with test and treat some at $31,100/QALY.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies for chronic HCV in co-infected patients with moderate hepatitis. METHODS: A state-transition model was used to simulate a cohort of HIV-infected patients with a mean CD4 cell count of 350 cells/ micro L and moderate chronic hepatitis C stratified by genotype. Strategies included interferon alfa (48 weeks), pegylated interferon alfa (48 weeks), interferon alfa and ribavirin (24 and 48 weeks), pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (48 weeks), and no treatment. Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Treatment for moderate chronic HCV with combination therapy using an interferon-based regimen reduced the incidence of cirrhosis and provided gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy ranging from 6.2 to 13.9 months, depending on genotype. Regardless of genotype, the cost-effectiveness of interferon alfa and ribavirin for patients with moderate hepatitis was lower than $50 000 per QALY vs the next best strategy. With genotype 1, pegylated interferon alfa (vs interferon alfa) and ribavirin therapy provided an additional 1.6 quality-adjusted life-months for $40 000 per QALY. Because treatment is more effective with non-1 genotypes, pegylated interferon (vs interferon alfa) and ribavirin provided only 3 additional quality-adjusted life-months for $105 300 per QALY.

METHODS: A state-transition model was used to simulate a cohort of HIV-infected patients with a mean CD4 cell count of 350 cells/ micro L and moderate chronic hepatitis C stratified by genotype. Strategies included interferon alfa (48 weeks), pegylated interferon alfa (48 weeks), interferon alfa and ribavirin (24 and 48 weeks), pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (48 weeks), and no treatment. Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Treatment for moderate chronic HCV with combination therapy using an interferon-based regimen reduced the incidence of cirrhosis and provided gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy ranging from 6.2 to 13.9 months, depending on genotype. Regardless of genotype, the cost-effectiveness of interferon alfa and ribavirin for patients with moderate hepatitis was lower than $50 000 per QALY vs the next best strategy. With genotype 1, pegylated interferon alfa (vs interferon alfa) and ribavirin therapy provided an additional 1.6 quality-adjusted life-months for $40 000 per QALY. Because treatment is more effective with non-1 genotypes, pegylated interferon (vs interferon alfa) and ribavirin provided only 3 additional quality-adjusted life-months for $105 300 per QALY. For patients who were intolerant of ribavirin, monotherapy with pegylated interferon was always the most cost-effective option.

1638,Treatment for hepatitis C virus in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients: clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important cause of liver disease in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies for chronic HCV in co-infected patients with moderate hepatitis. METHODS: A state-transition model was used to simulate a cohort of HIV-infected patients with a mean CD4 cell count of 350 cells/ micro L and moderate chronic hepatitis C stratified by genotype. Strategies included interferon alfa (48 weeks), pegylated interferon alfa (48 weeks), interferon alfa and ribavirin (24 and 48 weeks), pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin (48 weeks), and no treatment. Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Treatment for moderate chronic HCV with combination therapy using an interferon-based regimen reduced the incidence of cirrhosis and provided gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy ranging from 6.2 to 13.9 months, depending on genotype. Regardless of genotype, the cost-effectiveness of interferon alfa and ribavirin for patients with moderate hepatitis was lower than $50 000 per QALY vs the next best strategy. With genotype 1, pegylated interferon alfa (vs interferon alfa) and ribavirin therapy provided an additional 1.6 quality-adjusted life-months for $40 000 per QALY. Because treatment is more effective with non-1 genotypes, pegylated interferon (vs interferon alfa) and ribavirin provided only 3 additional quality-adjusted life-months for $105 300 per QALY.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of cholesterol changes and fat redistribution symptoms on the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of early antiretroviral therapy in these patients. METHODS: We used a state-transition model to compare initiating antiretroviral therapy at CD4 cell counts of 350/microL (early therapy) with initiating therapy at CD4 cell counts of 200/microL (deferred therapy) in patients with HIV RNA levels of 10,000 to 30,000 copies/mL. Data were from randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, and other published literature. RESULTS: If cholesterol changes associated with antiretroviral therapy resulted in a permanent increase in coronary heart disease risk, life expectancy with early therapy was 16.54 years (vs 16.66 years without this risk) and with deferred therapy was 13.73 years (vs 13.80 years without this risk). Early therapy was a more efficient use of resources (ie, dominated) compared with deferred therapy.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of cholesterol changes and fat redistribution symptoms on the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of early antiretroviral therapy in these patients. METHODS: We used a state-transition model to compare initiating antiretroviral therapy at CD4 cell counts of 350/microL (early therapy) with initiating therapy at CD4 cell counts of 200/microL (deferred therapy) in patients with HIV RNA levels of 10,000 to 30,000 copies/mL.

RESULTS: If cholesterol changes associated with antiretroviral therapy resulted in a permanent increase in coronary heart disease risk, life expectancy with early therapy was 16.54 years (vs 16.66 years without this risk) and with deferred therapy was 13.73 years (vs 13.80 years without this risk).

DESIGN: Primary analysis: four year cost effectiveness analysis based directly on results from a randomised controlled trial in which patients were individually allocated to invitation to ultrasound screening (intervention) or to a control group not offered screening. Secondary analysis: projection of the data, based on conservative assumptions, to indicate likely cost effectiveness at 10 years. SETTING: Four centres in the United Kingdom. Screening delivered in primary care settings with follow up and surgery offered in the main hospitals Participants: Population based sample of 67 800 men aged 65-74 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality from and costs (screening, follow up, elective and emergency surgery) related to abdominal aortic aneurysm; cost per life year gained. RESULTS: Over four years there were 47 fewer deaths related to abdominal aortic aneurysms in the screening group than in the control group, but the additional costs incurred were pound 2.2m. After adjustment for censoring and discounted at 6% the mean additional cost of the screening programme was pound 63.39 ($97.77, euro;100.48) (95% confidence interval pound 53.31 to pound 73.48) per patient. The hazard ratio for abdominal aortic aneurysm was 0.58 (0.42 to 0.78). Over four years the mean incremental cost effectiveness ratio for screening was pound 28 400 ( pound 15 000 to pound 146 000) per life year gained, equivalent to about pound 36 000 per quality adjusted life year. After 10 years this figure is estimated to fall to around pound 8000 per life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Even at four years the cost effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms is at the margin of acceptability according to current NHS thresholds. Over a longer period the cost effectiveness will improve substantially, the predicted ratio at 10 years falling to around a quarter of the four year figure.",2002-01-00876,12433761,BMJ,Group Author,2002,325 / 7373,1135,No,12433761,"Group Author; Multicentre aneurysm screening study (MASS): cost effectiveness analysis of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms based on four year results from randomised controlled trial, BMJ, 2002-Nov-16; 325(7373):0959-8138; 1135",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms vs. No screening,Not Stated,74 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,4 Years,6.00,1.50,36000,United Kingdom,2000,82002.7
1661,A cost-utility scenario analysis of bilateral cochlear implantation,"CONTEXT: Unilateral cochlear implantation is a cost-effective intervention for profound bilateral hearing loss. There is worldwide interest in providing implants bilaterally. OBJECTIVE: To use modeling to estimate the cost of gaining a quality-adjusted life-year by providing implants to both ears of profoundly postlingually deafened adults. DESIGN: Economic scenario analysis relating the costs of providing implants to estimates of the gain in health-related quality of life (utility) from unilateral and bilateral implantation. SETTING: Fourteen hospitals in the United Kingdom National Health Service and 1 Medical Research Council research unit.

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) was calculated for endovascular repair relative to open surgery in a cohort of 70-year-old men with an AAA between 5 and 6 cm in diameter. Clinically effectiveness data were derived from the literature. Cost data were derived from Medicare reimbursement rates, the hospital database, and the literature. One- and multiple-way sensitivity analyses were performed on uncertain model parameters. Costs were converted to year 2000 U.S. dollars; future costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: The incremental CER of endovascular repair was 9,905 dollars per QALY. QALYs and lifetime costs were higher for endovascular repair than for open surgery (6.74 vs 6.52 and 39,785 dollars vs 37,606 dollars, respectively). In sensitivity analyses, the incremental CER was insensitive to immediate conversion rate and procedure mortality rate. The incremental CER was sensitive (ie, more than 75,000 dollars per QALY or endovascular repair was ruled out by dominance) to systemic-remote complications, long-term failures, and ruptures. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that endovascular repair is a cost-effective alternative compared with open surgery for the elective repair of AAA. The benefits and cost-effectiveness are highly dependent on uncertain outcomes, however, particularly long-term failure and rupture rates.",2002-01-00889,12409564,Radiology,Johanna L Bosch,2002,225 / 2,337-44,No,12409564,"Johanna L Bosch; John A Kaufman; Molly T Beinfeld; Miraude E A P M Adriaensen; David C Brewster; G Scott Gazelle; Abdominal aortic aneurysms: cost-effectiveness of elective endovascular and open surgical repair, Radiology, 2002-Nov; 225(2):0033-8419; 337-44",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Elective endovascular repair vs. Elective open surgical repair,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,9905,United States,2000,14886.89
1676,Benefit of population-based screening for phenotypic hemochromatosis in young men,"BACKGROUND: Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a common genetic disease leading to accumulation of iron in the body, most notably in the liver. More men than women become clinically ill. The prognosis is excellent if phlebotomy treatment is started before liver cirrhosis develops. Screening has been recommended, but the benefit of population-based screening has never been shown in a randomized clinical trial. In this article, we estimate the benefit of screening young men, using a theoretical model. METHODS: A phenotypic screening scenario was modelled using a decision tree. Gain of quality-adjusted life-years was used as a measure of benefit, and estimated using Markov processes. Data on the accuracy of the screening tests, the prevalence of HH and the risk of liver cirrhosis were mainly derived from a cross-sectional study on the prevalence and morbidity of HH in 30509 men. Data on the excess mortality of cirrhosis were taken from relevant literature. Sensitivity analysis was done for important variables. RESULTS: Assuming basal case values for variables, screening a cohort of 1000 men aged 30 years for phenotypic HH would gain about 8 quality-adjusted life-years, compared to awaiting symptomatic disease. Based on actual costs of our cross-sectional study, the screening cost was US$250 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The prevalence of phenotypic HH, the excess mortality of liver cirrhosis, the quality of life in non-cirrhotic HH patients, and the fractions of patients compliant with treatment were the most important variables in the sensitivity analysis.

1678,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of 54 weeks of infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis,"PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of infliximab plus methotrexate for active, refractory rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: We projected the 54-week results from a randomized controlled trial of infliximab into lifetime economic and clinical outcomes using a Markov computer simulation model. Direct and indirect costs, quality of life, and disability estimates were based on trial results; Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System (ARAMIS) database outcomes; and published data. Results were discounted using the standard 3% rate. Because most well-accepted medical therapies have cost-effectiveness ratios below $50,000 to $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, results below this range were considered to be ""cost-effective."" RESULTS: At 3 mg/kg, each infliximab infusion would cost $1393. When compared with methotrexate alone, 54 weeks of infliximab plus methotrexate decreased the likelihood of having advanced disability from 23% to 11% at the end of 54 weeks, which projected to a lifetime marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $30,500 per discounted QALY gained, considering only direct medical costs. When applying a societal perspective and including indirect or productivity costs, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio for infliximab was $9100 per discounted QALY gained. The results remained relatively unchanged with variation of model estimates over a broad range of values. CONCLUSIONS: Infliximab plus methotrexate for 54 weeks for rheumatoid arthritis should be cost-effective with its clinical benefit providing good value for the drug cost, especially when including productivity losses. Although infliximab beyond 54 weeks will likely be cost-effective, the economic and clinical benefit remains uncertain and will depend on long-term results of clinical trials.",2002-01-00896,12401535,Am J Med,John B.

1679,"An analysis of multiple staging management strategies for carcinoma of the esophagus: computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound, positron emission tomography, and thoracoscopy/laparoscopy","BACKGROUND: This study compares the health care costs and effectiveness of multiple staging options for patients with esophageal cancer. Techniques studied included computed tomographic (CT) scan, endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA), positron emission tomography (PET), thoracoscopy/laparoscopy, and combinations of these. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was constructed to compare different staging strategies. Costs were derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked databases and from other Medicare reimbursement rates. Life expectancies were obtained from the 1973-1996 SEER database and adjusted for quality of life. Cost and effectiveness measures were discounted at 0% and 3% per year. Sensitivity and specificity measures were obtained from the published literature and a parallel prospective clinical trial, and all key variables were subjected to sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, CT + EUS-FNA was the most inexpensive strategy and offered more quality-adjusted life-years, on average, than all other strategies with the exception of PET + EUS-FNA. The latter was slightly more effective but also more expensive. The marginal cost-effectiveness ratio for PET + EUS-FNA was $60,544 per quality-adjusted life-year. These findings were robust and changed very little in all of the sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of PET + EUS-FNA should be the recommended staging procedure for patients with esophageal cancer, unless resources are scarce or PET is unavailable. In these instances, CT + EUS-FNA can be considered the preferred strategy.",2002-01-00897,12400740,Ann Thorac Surg,Michael B Wallace,2002,74 / 4,1026-32,No,12400740,"Michael B Wallace; Paul J Nietert; Craig Earle; Mark J Krasna; Robert H Hawes; Brenda J Hoffman; Carolyn E Reed; An analysis of multiple staging management strategies for carcinoma of the esophagus: computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound, positron emission tomography, and thoracoscopy/laparoscopy, Ann Thorac Surg, 2002-Oct; 74(4):0003-4975; 1026-32",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Positron emission tomography (PET) and Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration biopsy vs. Computed tomography (CT) scan and Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration biopsy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,60544,United States,2000,90995.66
1680,Laparoscopic v open donor nephrectomy: a cost-utility analysis of the initial experience at a tertiary-care center,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LapDN) offers donors more rapid postoperative recovery and recipients equivalent graft function when compared with open donor nephrectomy (OpenDN). Nonetheless, costs are less favorable for LapDN than for OpenDN. We compared LapDN and OpenDN with cost-utility analysis. METHODS: A decision analysis modeling approach was performed: utilities derived using time trade-off and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) techniques; probabilities derived from a systematic review of the literature. All costs were included from a societal perspective using actual cost data from OpenDN and LapDN patients performed contemporaneously between July 1, 2000 and December 31, 2000. Costs of lost employment were estimated using mean provincial annual earnings. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated with ""best-case"" and ""worst-case"" scenarios for confidence intervals; sensitivity analyses were used to assess robustness. RESULTS: LapDN costs are higher ($10,317.40 vs. $9,853.70), while quality of life (QOL) is superior (0.7683 vs. 0.7062). The ICER from a societal perspective was C$7,471.11/QALY. If all donor nephrectomies nationally were performed laparoscopically, there would be an additional annual cost of C$665,240 with a societal gain of 24.84 QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: LapDN offers improved QOL at marginally higher cost. A societal ICER of $7,471.11/QALY compares favorably to many accepted health-care interventions.

1681,Cost-utility analysis of patient care in children with meningeal signs,"OBJECTIVES: We designed a model of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions applied in children with meningeal signs. Using this model, we determined in a cost-utility analysis the consequences for society of different diagnostic strategies in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. METHODS: Data were used from 360 children (0.1-15 years) visiting the pediatric emergency department of the Sophia Children""s Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands (1988-98) with meningeal signs. Model inputs included probabilities of meningitis and adverse outcome, QALYs for years lived with long-term sequelae, and costs of tests and treatments. Mean outcome measures were costs and effects of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions in children suspected of bacterial meningitis, key determinants of the model outcomes, and evaluation of alternative diagnostic strategies and two vaccination programs in an analysis. RESULTS: The population comprised 99 children with bacterial meningitis (adverse outcome in 10), 36 with serious other bacterial infections, and 225 with self-limiting diseases. Key determinants were the risk of bacterial meningitis or sequelae, costs of treatment, and long-term morbidity. Minimizing lumbar punctures and empirical treatments using a diagnostic decision rule, without missing a single case of meningitis, was a dominant strategy to actual practice.

1683,Cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery. Method to assess cost-effectiveness using registry data,"To develop a method to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with cataract surgery using large patient registries.Four centers in Sweden.Five hundred patients scheduled for cataract extraction in 1 eye at 1 of 4 centers in Sweden during March 1999 were asked to complete the EQ-5D, a preference-based quality-of-life instrument, and the Catquest, a disease-specific disability measure, before surgery. Multiple regression analysis was used to study the correlation between utility and visual acuity and/or disability and utility and QALY gain through the intervention estimated.Visual acuity and Catquest scores were available for 484 patients. The mean age was 76.1 years; the mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.59 in the surgical eye and 0.26 in the other eye. The mean Catquest disability score was 13.79 and the mean utility, 0.74. Utilities correlated significantly with visual acuity and disability scores, and the correlations remained significant when both were included in a regression model, indicating that the 2 measure different concepts. The hypothetical cost per QALY gained (discounted at 3%) was estimated at 45000 SKr (4500 US dollars) using the Swedish Cataract Registry.The results indicate that visual acuity and visual disability significantly affect utilities controlled for age and ophthalmic comorbidity.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that about 50% of readmissions for CHF can be prevented by a multidisciplinary approach. However, the performance, effectiveness, and cost/utility ratio of a process of HF outpatient management related to evidence-based medicine have not been considered. METHODS: A total of 234 prospective patients discharged by a HF Unit were randomized to two management strategies: 122 patients to usual community care and 112 patients to a HF management program delivered by the DH. Management (rate of readmissions, therapeutic interventions), functional parameters (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class, left ventricular diameters, and ejection fraction, deceleration time of early diastolic mitral flow, peak oxygen uptake, and mitral regurgitation) and hard outcomes (cardiac death and urgent cardiac transplantation) were evaluated. The cost/utility ratios of the two strategies were compared. RESULTS: After 12 +/- 3 months of follow-up, the individual rate access in DH was 5.5 +/- 3.8 days. The DH subjects were readmitted to the hospital less frequently than were the usual-care group patients (13 vs. 78, p < 0.00001). Patients allocated to usual-care management showed heterogeneous changes in NYHA functional class (13% improved and 16% worsened p = NS); In contrast, the DH group showed significant changes in NYHA functional class (23% improved and 11% worsened, p < 0.009). Hard cardiac events in the one-year follow-up occurred in 25/234 (10.6%) patients; cardiac death occurred in 21/122 (17.2%) of the community group and in 3/112 (2.7%) in the DH group (p < 0.0007). One DH patient underwent urgent transplantation. Comparison of the two managerial models by Cox regression analysis showed that DH management significantly protected against the appearance of hard events (relative risk [RR] 0.17; confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.66). The cost/utility ratio of the two management strategies was similar (usual care $2,409 vs. DH $2,244). The incremental analysis revealed a cost savings of $1,068 for each quality-adjusted life year gained. The cost/utility ratio for the integration of DH management of CHF was $19,462 (CI $13,904 to $34,048). CONCLUSIONS: A heart failure outpatient management program delivered by a DH can reduce mortality and morbidity of CHF patients.

1685,Cost effectiveness of combined spa-exercise therapy in ankylosing spondylitis: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost utility of a 3-week course of combined spa therapy and exercise therapy in addition to standard treatment consisting of antiinflammatory drugs and weekly group physical therapy in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients. METHODS: A total of 120 Dutch outpatients with AS were randomly allocated into 3 groups of 40 patients each. Group 1 was treated in a spa resort in Bad Hofgastein, Austria; group 2 in a spa resort in Arcen, The Netherlands. The control group stayed at home and continued their usual activities and standard treatment during the intervention weeks. After the intervention, all patients followed weekly group physical therapy. The total study period was 40 weeks. Effectiveness of the intervention was assessed by functional ability using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Function Index (BASFI). Utilities were measured with the EuroQoL (EQ-5D(utility)). A time-integrated summary score defined the clinical effects (BASFI-area under the curve [AUC]) and utilities (EQ-5D(utility)-AUC) over time. Both direct (health care and non-health care) and indirect costs were included. Resource utilization and absence from work were registered weekly by the patients in a diary. All costs were calculated from a societal perspective. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients completed the diary. The between-group difference for the BASFI-AUC was 1.0 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.4-1.6; P = 0.001) for group 1 versus controls, and 0.6 (95% CI 0.1-1.1; P = 0.020) for group 2 versus controls. The between-group difference for EQ-5D(utility)-AUC was 0.17 (95% CI 0.09-0.25; P < 0.001) for group 1 versus controls, and 0.08 (95% CI 0.00-0.15; P = 0.04) for group 2 versus controls. The mean total costs per patient (including costs for spa therapy) in Euros (euro;) during the study period were euro;3,023 for group 1, euro;3,240 for group 2, and euro;1,754 for the control group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per unit effect gained in functional ability (0-10 scale) was euro;1,269 (95% CI 497-3,316) for group 1, and euro;2,477 (95% CI 601-12,098) for group 2.

1686,Randomized controlled economic evaluation of asthma self-management in primary health care,"In this randomized controlled economic evaluation we compared guided asthma self-management with usual asthma care according to guidelines for Dutch family physicians. Nineteen family practices were randomized, and 193 adults with stable asthma (98 self-management, 95 usual care) were included and monitored for 2 years. We hypothesized that introducing self-management would not compromise asthma control and cost would be equal to or lower than in usual care. Patient-specific cost data were collected, preference-based utilities were assessed, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and successfully treated week gained was calculated. Self-management patients gained 0.039 QALY (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.003 to 0.075) and experienced 81 (95% CI, 78 to 84) successfully treated weeks in 2 years"" time; the corresponding figures for usual care were 0.024 (95% CI, -0.022 to 0.071) and 75 (95% CI, 72 to 78). Total costs were 1,084 euros(95% CI, 938 to 1,228) for self-management and 1,097 euros (95% CI, 933 to 1,260) for usual care.

1687,Newborn screening with tandem mass spectrometry: examining its cost-effectiveness in the Wisconsin Newborn Screening Panel,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in a neonatal screening panel for 14 fatty acid oxidation and organic acidemia disorders in the Wisconsin Newborn Screening Program. STUDY DESIGN: An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis with a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 infants was performed. A threshold of $50,000/QALY (quality-adjusted life-year) was used to determine whether screening for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCAD) alone is cost-effective or whether additional disorders would need to be incorporated into the analysis to arrive at a conclusion regarding the overall cost-effectiveness of MS/MS. RESULTS: Under conservative assumptions, screening for MCAD alone yields an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $41,862/QALY. With the use of more realistic assumptions, screening becomes more cost-effective ($6008/QALY) and remains cost-effective so long as the incremental cost of screening remains under $13.05 per test. Adding the incremental costs of detecting the 13 other disorders on the screening panel still yields a result well within accepted norms for cost-effectiveness ($15,252/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: In Wisconsin, MS/MS screening for MCAD alone appears to be cost-effective.

1689,The cost-effectiveness of the WINGS intervention: a program to prevent HIV and sexually transmitted diseases among high-risk urban women,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the WINGS project, an intervention to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases among urban women at high risk for sexual acquisition of HIV. METHODS: We used standard methods of cost-effectiveness analysis. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the intervention""s cost and we used a simplified model of HIV transmission to estimate the number of HIV infections averted by the intervention. We calculated cost-effectiveness ratios for the complete intervention and for the condom use skills component of the intervention. RESULTS: Under base case assumptions, the intervention prevented an estimated 0.2195 new cases of HIV at a cost of $215,690 per case of HIV averted. When indirect costs of HIV were excluded from the analysis, the intervention""s cost-effectiveness ratios were $357,690 per case of HIV averted and $31,851 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. Under base case assumptions, the condom use skills component of the intervention prevented an estimated 0.1756 HIV infections and was cost-saving. When indirect HIV costs were excluded, the cost-effectiveness ratios for the condom use skills component of the intervention were $97,404 per case of HIV averted and $8,674 per QALY saved.

1692,Cost-effectiveness of the pneumococcal vaccine in healthy younger adults,"OBJECTIVES: Routine vaccination for Streptococcus pneumoniae has been recommended as a cost-effective measure for elderly and immunocompromised patients, yet no analysis has been performed for healthy younger adults in America. The authors evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the pneumococcal vaccine and determined the net health benefits conferred for the healthy young adult population. METHODS: The authors developed a decision model to compare the health and economic outcomes of vaccinate versus do not vaccinate for S. pneumoniae. RESULTS: Vaccinating patients for S. pneumoniae generates benefits that are dependent on incidence rates and the efficacy of the vaccine. In the 22-year-old patient with a pneumonia incidence of 0.3/1000, the vaccine would need to be > 71 percent effective for the vaccination strategy to cost less than $50,000/QALY gained. At an incidence of 0.4/1000, the threshold efficacy is 53 percent, whereas at 0.5/1000 it is 43 percent. In the 35-year-old patient where the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia is higher (0.85/1000), the vaccine would be cost-effective with an efficacy as low as 30 percent. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the S. pneumoniae vaccine in young adults would provide modest reductions in pneumonia-associated morbidity and mortality.

1700,Cost-effectiveness of newer treatment strategies for influenza,"PURPOSE: Recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of influenza, such as rapid testing and neuraminidase inhibitor therapy, are available, but their place in clinical practice and their cost-effectiveness have not been determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of these newer interventions, we used a decision model that compared several influenza management strategies: no testing or treatment, amantadine or rimantadine treatment without testing, testing then amantadine or rimantadine treatment, neuraminidase inhibitor treatment without testing, or testing then neuraminidase inhibitor treatment. Antiviral therapy began within 48 hours in febrile patients with characteristic symptoms of influenza. We assumed that antiviral treatment did not change rates of influenza complication or mortality, and chose parameter values in the baseline analysis to bias slightly against antiviral treatment and toward testing strategies. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, testing strategies are more expensive and less effective than treatment strategies. Amantadine costs $9.06 per illness day avoided or $11.60 per quality-adjusted day gained. Compared with amantadine, zanamivir costs $198 per illness day avoided or $185 per quality-adjusted day gained, whereas oseltamivir costs $252 per illness day avoided or $235 per quality-adjusted day gained. In elderly patients who require reduced dosage, rimantadine costs $128 per quality-adjusted day gained compared with amantadine. In younger patients, amantadine is favored if the likelihood of influenza A is >67%; otherwise, neuraminidase inhibitors are favored. Testing strategies are more costly and less effective when the influenza probability is >30%. No testing or treatment is favored if the influenza probability is <32% and the influenza utility is >0.77. In elderly patients, amantadine is favored over rimantadine if the utility of medication side effects is >0.94. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral treatment of influenza without rapid testing is reasonable economically in febrile patients with typical symptoms during influenza season. The choice of antiviral agent depends on age, the likelihood of influenza A, and the willingness to pay per quality-adjusted day gained.",2002-01-00927,12361816,Am J Med,Kenneth J Smith,2002,113 / 4,300-7,No,12361816,"Kenneth J Smith; Mark S Roberts; Cost-effectiveness of newer treatment strategies for influenza, Am J Med, 2002-Sep; 113(4):0002-9343; 300-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,No test and treat with amantadine vs. No test or treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,11.67,United States,2000,17.53
