31201,How Could Agronomic Biofortification of Rice Be an Alternative Strategy with Higher Cost-Effectiveness for Human Iron and Zinc Deficiency in China?,"BACKGROUND: Iron and zinc deficiencies affect human health globally, especially in developing countries. Agronomic biofortification, as a strategy for alleviating these issues, has been focused on small-scale field studies, and not widely applied while lacking of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). OBJECTIVE: We conducted the CEA of agronomic biofortification, expressed as USD per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved, to recommend a cost-effectiveness strategy that can be widely applied. METHODS: The DALYs were applied to quantify the health burden due to Fe and/or Zn deficiency and health cost of agronomic biofortification via a single, dual, or triple foliar spray of Fe, Zn, and/or pesticide in 4 (northeast, central China, southeast, and southwest) major Chinese rice-based regions. RESULTS: The current health burden by Fe or Zn malnutrition was 0.45 to 1.45 or 0.14 to 0.84 million DALYs for these 4 regions. Compared to traditional rice diets, the daily Fe and/or Zn intake from Fe and/or Zn-biofortified rice increased, and the health burden of Fe and/or Zn deficiency decreased by 28% and 48%, respectively. The cost of saving 1 DALYs ranged from US$376 to US$4989, US$194 to US$2730, and US$37.6 to US$530.1 for the single, dual, and triple foliar Fe, Zn, and/or pesticide application, respectively, due to a substantial decrease in labor costs by the latter 2 applications.

31230,The impact and cost-effectiveness of controlling cholera through the use of oral cholera vaccines in urban Bangladesh: A disease modeling and economic analysis,"BACKGROUND: Cholera remains an important public health problem in major cities in Bangladesh, especially in slum areas. In response to growing interest among local policymakers to control this disease, this study estimated the impact and cost-effectiveness of preventive cholera vaccination over a ten-year period in a high-risk slum population in Dhaka to inform decisions about the use of oral cholera vaccines as a key tool in reducing cholera risk in such populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Assuming use of a two-dose killed whole-cell oral cholera vaccine to be produced locally, the number of cholera cases and deaths averted was estimated for three target group options (1-4 year olds, 1-14 year olds, and all persons 1+), using cholera incidence data from Dhaka, estimates of vaccination coverage rates from the literature, and a dynamic model of cholera transmission based on data from Matlab, which incorporates herd effects. Local estimates of vaccination costs minus savings in treatment costs, were used to obtain incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for one- and ten-dose vial sizes. Vaccinating 1-14 year olds every three years, combined with annual routine vaccination of children, would be the most cost-effective strategy, reducing incidence in this population by 45% (assuming 10% annual migration), and costing was $823 (2015 USD) for single dose vials and $591 (2015 USD) for ten-dose vials per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Vaccinating all ages one year and above would reduce incidence by >90%, but would be 50% less cost-effective ($894-1,234/DALY averted). Limiting vaccination to 1-4 year olds would be the least cost-effective strategy (preventing only 7% of cases and costing $1,276-$1,731/DALY averted), due to the limited herd effects of vaccinating this small population and the lower vaccine efficacy in this age group.

Vaccinating 1-14 year olds every three years, combined with annual routine vaccination of children, would be the most cost-effective strategy, reducing incidence in this population by 45% (assuming 10% annual migration), and costing was $823 (2015 USD) for single dose vials and $591 (2015 USD) for ten-dose vials per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Vaccinating all ages one year and above would reduce incidence by >90%, but would be 50% less cost-effective ($894-1,234/DALY averted). Limiting vaccination to 1-4 year olds would be the least cost-effective strategy (preventing only 7% of cases and costing $1,276-$1,731/DALY averted), due to the limited herd effects of vaccinating this small population and the lower vaccine efficacy in this age group.

31235,The impact and cost-effectiveness of controlling cholera through the use of oral cholera vaccines in urban Bangladesh: A disease modeling and economic analysis,"BACKGROUND: Cholera remains an important public health problem in major cities in Bangladesh, especially in slum areas. In response to growing interest among local policymakers to control this disease, this study estimated the impact and cost-effectiveness of preventive cholera vaccination over a ten-year period in a high-risk slum population in Dhaka to inform decisions about the use of oral cholera vaccines as a key tool in reducing cholera risk in such populations.

31236,Cost-effectiveness of Humanitarian Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Programs in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,"Importance: Endorsement of global humanitarian interventions is based on either proven cost-effectiveness or perceived public health benefits. The cost-effectiveness and long-term benefits of global humanitarian pediatric cardiac surgery are unknown, and funding for this intervention is insufficient. Objectives: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention (multiple 2-week-long humanitarian pediatric cardiac surgery program assistance trips to various low- and middle-income countries [LMICs]) and to produce a measure of the long-lasting effects of global humanitarian programs. Design, Setting, and Participants: International, multicenter cost-effectiveness analysis of a cohort of children (aged <16 years) undergoing surgical treatment of congenital heart disease during 2015 in LMICs, including China, Macedonia, Honduras, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, and Ukraine. The study also assessed estimated improvement in the United Nations Human Development Indicators (life expectancy, years of schooling, and gross national income) for each individual survivor, as a proxy for long-term benefits of the intervention. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The secondary outcomes were potential gains in life expectancy, years of schooling, and gross national income per capita for each survivor. Results: During 2015, 446 patients (192 [43%] female; mean [SD] age, 3.7 [5.4] years) were served in 10 LMICs at an overall cost of $3210873. Of them, 424 were children. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was $171 per disability-adjusted life-year averted. Each survivor in the cohort (390 of 424) potentially gained 39.9 disability-adjusted life-years averted, 3.5 years of schooling, and $159533 in gross national income per capita during his or her extended lifetime at purchasing power parity and 3% discounting. Conclusions and Relevance: Humanitarian pediatric cardiac surgery in LMICs is highly cost-effective. It also leaves behind a lasting humanitarian footprint by potentially improving individual development indices.",2018-99-28085,30646368,JAMA Netw Open,Marcelo Cardarelli,2018,1 / 7,e184707,No,30646368,"Marcelo Cardarelli; Sumeet Vaikunth; Katie Mills; Thomas DiSessa; Frank Molloy; Elizabeth Sauter; Karen Bowtell; Roslyn Rivera; Andrew Y Shin; William Novick; Cost-effectiveness of Humanitarian Pediatric Cardiac Surgery Programs in Low- and Middle-Income Countries, JAMA Netw Open, 2018 Nov 2; 1(7):2574-3805; e184707",DALY,"China, Honduras, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, North Macedonia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Ukraine",Not Stated,Surgical,Pediatric Cardiac Surgery vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,Not Stated,171,United States,2015,186.72
31237,Cost-effectiveness of universal isoniazid preventive therapy among HIV-infected pregnant women in South Africa,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of universal vs. test-directed treatment of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive pregnant women in South Africa. METHODS: We compared tuberculin skin test (TST) directed isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) (TST placement with delivery of IPT to women with positive results) against QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold In-Tube (QGIT) directed IPT and universal IPT using decision analysis. Costs were measured empirically in six primary care public health clinics in Matlosana, South Africa. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed in 2016 US$ per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. RESULTS: We estimated that 29.2 of every 1000 pregnant women would develop TB over the course of 1 year in the absence of IPT. TST-directed IPT reduced this number to 24.5 vs. 22.6 with QGIT-directed IPT and 21.0 with universal IPT. Universal IPT was estimated to cost $640/DALY averted (95% uncertainty range $44-$3146) relative to TST-directed IPT and was less costly and more effective (i.e., dominant) than QGIT-directed IPT.

31239,Prioritising allocation of donor human breast milk amongst very low birthweight infants in middle-income countries,"The use of donor human breast milk instead of formula reduces the risk of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants when their mother''s own milk is insufficient. Use of donor milk is limited by the cost of establishing a milk bank and a lack of donors, but the optimal rationing of limited donor milk is unclear. This paper uses an economic model to explore how a limited donor milk supply should be allocated across very low birthweight infants in South Africa considering 2 outcomes: maximising lives saved and minimising costs. We developed a probabilistic cohort Markov decision model with 10,000 infants across 4 birthweight groups. We evaluated allocation scenarios in which infants in each group could be exclusively formula-fed or fed donor milk for 14 or 28 days and thereafter formula until death or discharge. Prioritising infants in the lowest birthweight groups would save the most lives, whereas prioritising infants in the highest birthweight groups would result in the highest cost savings. All allocation scenarios would be considered very cost-effective in South Africa compared to the use of formula; the ""worst case"" was $619 per Disability Adjusted Life Year averted. There is a compelling argument to increase the supply of donor milk in middle-income countries. Our analysis could be extended by taking a longer term perspective, using data from more than one country and exploring the use of donor milk as an adjunct to mother''s own milk, rather than a pure substitute for it.",2018-99-28126,30592164,Matern Child Nutr,Celia Taylor,2018,14 Suppl 6 /,e12595,No,30592164,"Celia Taylor; Yaseen Joolay; Abigail Buckle; Richard Lilford; Prioritising allocation of donor human breast milk amongst very low birthweight infants in middle-income countries, Matern Child Nutr, 2018 Dec; 14 Suppl 6():1740-8709; e12595",DALY,South Africa,Not Stated,"Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Other",Worst-case allocation scenario: only giving donor milk to infants in the 500-750 g birthweight group for 14 days vs. Infants fed with formula,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,259,United States,2015,282.82
31240,"Health, financial, and education gains of investing in preventive chemotherapy for schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiases, and lymphatic filariasis in Madagascar: A modeling study","BACKGROUND: Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) account for a large disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa. While the general cost-effectiveness of NTD interventions to improve health outcomes has been assessed, few studies have also accounted for the financial and education gains of investing in NTD control. METHODS: We built on extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) methods to assess the health gains (e.g. infections, disability-adjusted life years or DALYs averted), household financial gains (out-of-pocket expenditures averted), and education gains (cases of school absenteeism averted) for five NTD interventions that the government of Madagascar aims to roll out nationally. The five NTDs considered were schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis, and three soil-transmitted helminthiases (Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and hookworm infections). RESULTS: The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness for the roll-out of preventive chemotherapy for all NTDs jointly was USD125 per DALY averted (95% uncertainty range: 65-231), and its benefit-cost ratio could vary between 5 and 31. Our analysis estimated that, per dollar spent, schistosomiasis preventive chemotherapy, in particular, could avert a large number of infections (176,000 infections averted per $100,000 spent), DALYs (2,000 averted per $100,000 spent), and cases of school absenteeism (27,000 school years gained per $100,000 spent). CONCLUSION: This analysis incorporates financial and education gains into the economic evaluation of health interventions, and therefore provides information about the efficiency of attainment of three Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our findings reveal how the national scale-up of NTD control in Madagascar can help address health (SDG3), economic (SDG1), and education (SDG4) goals.

31241,Should we use Palivizumab immunoprophylaxis for infants against respiratory syncytial virus? - a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Passive immunization against RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is given in most western countries (including Israel) to infants of high risk groups such as premature babies, and infants with Congenital Heart Disease or Congenital Lung Disease. However, immunoprophylaxis costs are extremely high ($2800-$4200 per infant). Using cost-utility analysis criteria, we evaluate whether it is justified to expand, continue or restrict nationwide immunoprophylaxis using palivizumab of high risk infants against RSV. METHODS: Epidemiological, demographic, health service utilisation and economic data were integrated from primary (National Hospitalization Data, etc.) and secondary data sources (ie: from published articles) into a spread-sheet to calculate the cost per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of vaccinating various infant risk groups. Costs of intervention included antibody plus administration costs. Treatment savings and DALYs averted were estimated from applying vaccine efficacy data to relative risks of being hospitalised and treated for RSV, including possible long-term sequelae like asthma and wheezing. RESULTS: For all the groups RSV immunoprophylaxis is clearly not cost effective as its cost per averted DALY exceeds the $105,986 guideline representing thrice the per capita Gross Domestic Product.

31246,Should we use Palivizumab immunoprophylaxis for infants against respiratory syncytial virus? - a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Passive immunization against RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus) is given in most western countries (including Israel) to infants of high risk groups such as premature babies, and infants with Congenital Heart Disease or Congenital Lung Disease. However, immunoprophylaxis costs are extremely high ($2800-$4200 per infant). Using cost-utility analysis criteria, we evaluate whether it is justified to expand, continue or restrict nationwide immunoprophylaxis using palivizumab of high risk infants against RSV. METHODS: Epidemiological, demographic, health service utilisation and economic data were integrated from primary (National Hospitalization Data, etc.) and secondary data sources (ie: from published articles) into a spread-sheet to calculate the cost per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of vaccinating various infant risk groups. Costs of intervention included antibody plus administration costs. Treatment savings and DALYs averted were estimated from applying vaccine efficacy data to relative risks of being hospitalised and treated for RSV, including possible long-term sequelae like asthma and wheezing. RESULTS: For all the groups RSV immunoprophylaxis is clearly not cost effective as its cost per averted DALY exceeds the $105,986 guideline representing thrice the per capita Gross Domestic Product. Vaccine price would have to fall by 48.1% in order to justify vaccinating Congenital Heart Disease or Congenital Lung Disease risk groups respectively on pure cost-effectiveness grounds. For premature babies of < 29 weeks, 29-32 and 33-36 weeks gestation, decreases of 36.8%, 54.5% and 83.3% respectively in vaccine price are required. CONCLUSIONS: Based solely on cost-utility analysis, at current price levels it is difficult to justify the current indications for passive vaccination with Palivizumab against RSV.

31256,Delivering reproductive health services through non-state providers in Pakistan: understanding the value for money of different approaches,"Background: Delivering Reproductive Health Results(DRHR) programme used social franchising (SF) and social marketing (SM) approaches to increase the supply of high quality family planning services in underserved areas of Pakistan. We assessed the costs, cost-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of DRHR to understand the value for money of these approaches. Methods: Financial and economic programme costs were calculated. Costs to individual users were captured in a pre-post survey. The cost per couple years of protection (CYP) and cost per new user were estimated as indicators of cost efficiency. For the cost-effectiveness analysis we estimated the cost per clinical outcome averted and the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Results: Approximately pound20 million were spent through the DRHR programme between July 2012 and September 2015 on commodities and services representing nearly four million CYPs. Based on programme data, the cumulative cost-efficiency of the entire DRHR programme was pound4.8 per CYP. DRHR activities would avert one DALY at the cost of pound20. Financial access indicators generally improved in programme areas, but the magnitude of progress varies across indicators. Conclusions: The SF and SM approaches adopted in DRHR appear to be cost effective relative to comparable reproductive health programmes. This paper adds to the limited evidence on the cost-effectiveness of different models of reproductive health care provision in low- and middle-income settings.

31257,Cost-effectiveness of a combined intervention of long lasting insecticidal nets and indoor residual spraying compared with each intervention alone for malaria prevention in Ethiopia,"Background: The effectiveness of long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), for malaria prevention, have been established in several studies. However, the available evidence about the additional resources required for a combined implementation (LLIN + IRS) with respect to the added protection afforded is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of combined implementation of LLINs and IRS, compared with LLINs alone, IRS alone, and routine practice in Ethiopia. Methods: The study was performed alongside a cluster randomized controlled trial of malaria prevention conducted in Adami Tullu district, in Ethiopia, from 2014 to 2016. In addition, literature-based cost-effectiveness analysis-using effectiveness information from a systematic review of published articles was conducted. Costing of the interventions were done from the providers'' perspective. The health-effect was measured using disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and combined with cost information using a Markov life-cycle model. In the base-case analysis, health-effects were based on the current trial, and in addition, a scenario analysis was performed based on a literature survey. Results: The current trial-based analysis showed that routine practice is not less effective and therefore dominates both the combined intervention and singleton intervention due to lower costs. The literature-based analysis had shown that combined intervention had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of USD 1403 per DALY averted, and USD 207 per DALY averted was estimated for LLIN alone. In order for the ICER for the combined intervention to be within a range of 1 GDP per capita per DALY averted, the annual malaria incidence in the area should be at least 13%, and the protective-effectiveness of combined implementation should be at least 53%. Conclusions: Based on the current trial-based analysis, LLINs and IRS are not cost-effective compared to routine practice. However, based on the literature-based analysis, LLIN alone is likely to be cost-effective compared to 3 times GDP per capita per DALY averted.

31260,"Cost and cost-effectiveness of voluntary medical male circumcision in street-connected youth: findings from an education-based pilot intervention in Eldoret, Kenya","BACKGROUND: Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is a critical component of HIV prevention. VMMC policies have achieved initial targets in adult men yet continue to fall short in reaching younger men and adolescents. SETTING: We present the cost and scale-up implications of an education-based, VMMC intervention for adolescent street-connected males, for whom the street has become their home and/or source of livelihood. The intervention was piloted as part of the Engaging Street Youth in HIV Interventions Project in Eldoret, Kenya. METHODS: We used a micro-costing approach to estimate the average cost of a VMMC intervention in 116 street-connected youth. Average cost was estimated per individual and per cohort by dividing total cost per intervention by number of clients accessing the intervention over a 30-day period. Total average costs included direct and support procedure costs, educational costs, and direct research costs. Cost-effectiveness was measured in cost per DALYs averted over a 5 and 10-year period. RESULTS: The total cost of the intervention was $12,526 over the 30-day period, with an average cost per individual of $108. The direct VMMC procedure cost was approximately $9 per individual. Personnel costs contributed the greatest percentage to the total intervention cost (38.2%), with mentors and social workers representing the highest wage earners. Retreat-related and education costs contributed 51% and 13% respectively to the total average cost, with surgical equipment costs contributing less than 1%. At a cost of $108 per individual, the intervention averted 60166 DALYs in 5 years resulting in a cost per DALY averted of $267. CONCLUSION: The VMMC intervention was highly cost-effective in Kenya, despite the additional costs incurred to reach SCY. Further scale-up may be warranted to effectively apply this intervention in comparable populations.",2018-01-04760,30497481,Hum. Ecol.,O Galarraga,2018,15 / 1,24,No,30497481,"O Galarraga; A.

31261,Cost Effectiveness of New Diagnostic Tools for Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Afghanistan,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is responsible for chronic and disfiguring skin lesions resulting in morbidity and social stigma. The gold standard to diagnose cutaneous leishmaniasis is microscopy but has a variable sensitivity and requires trained personnel. Using four scenarios, the objective of this study is to compare the cost effectiveness of microscopy with two new tools: Loopamp Leishmania Detection Kit (LAMP) and CL Detect Rapid Test (RDT). METHODS: Data related to the cost and accuracy of these tools were collected at the clinic of the National Malaria and Leishmaniasis Control Program in Kabul, Afghanistan. The effectiveness estimates were measured based on the tools'' performance but also indirectly, using the disability-adjusted life years. A decision tree was designed in TreeAge Healthcare Pro 2016, combined with a Markov model representing the natural history of cutaneous leishmaniasis. In addition to a deterministic analysis, univariate sensitivity and probabilistic analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: If the tools are compared at the National Malaria and Leishmaniasis Control Program level in a period of low incidence, microscopy remains the preferred option. LAMP becomes more appropriate during cutaneous leishmaniasis seasons or outbreaks when its capacity to process several tests (e.g. up to 48) at a time can be maximised. RDT has a cost similar to microscopy when used at the reference clinic but as it is relatively easy to use, it could be implemented at the peripheral level, which would become cheaper than employing microscopy at the reference clinic. Moreover, combining RDT with microscopy or LAMP at the reference clinic for the negative suspects is economically more interesting than directly performing LAMP or microscopy respectively on all cutaneous leishmaniasis suspects at the reference clinic.

31263,"Re-evaluating the cost and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Bangladesh, Ghana, and Malawi: A comparison of three rotavirus vaccines","INTRODUCTION: Diarrhea is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and rotavirus accounts for many of these deaths. As of August 2018, 96 countries have introduced rotavirus vaccines into their immunization programs. Two rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix(R) and RotaTeq(R), have been WHO-prequalified since 2009, with Rotarix(R) being the preferred product of most Gavi-supported countries. ROTAVAC(R) and ROTASIIL(R) have both been prequalified recently. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reevaluated the costs and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Bangladesh, Ghana, and Malawi and compared Rotarix(R), ROTAVAC(R), and ROTASIIL(R) in each country. For consistency with previously published analyses in these countries, we used the same Excel-based cohort model and much of the same data as the original analyses. We varied the expected price (with and without Gavi subsidy), wastage, and incremental health system costs associated with each vaccine. We assumed the same efficacy and waning assumptions following administration of two or three doses for the respective product. RESULTS: The discounted cost per DALY averted compared to no vaccination ranged from 0.3 to 1.3 times GNI per capita for each vaccine. With the Gavi subsidy, the average cost-effectiveness ratios were below 0.3 times GNI per capita in all three countries. Though critical empirical cost data are not yet available, Rotarix(R) is the least costly and most cost-effective product in the countries examined in this modelling study. However, small decreases in the incremental health system cost for other products could result in cost and cost-effectiveness outcomes that match or surpass those of Rotarix(R). CONCLUSION: Countries may wish to consider new rotavirus vaccines entering the market. Countries should carefully examine multiple product attributes including price and the incremental health system costs associated with each vaccine.

31267,"Re-evaluating the cost and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Bangladesh, Ghana, and Malawi: A comparison of three rotavirus vaccines","INTRODUCTION: Diarrhea is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and rotavirus accounts for many of these deaths. As of August 2018, 96 countries have introduced rotavirus vaccines into their immunization programs. Two rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix(R) and RotaTeq(R), have been WHO-prequalified since 2009, with Rotarix(R) being the preferred product of most Gavi-supported countries. ROTAVAC(R) and ROTASIIL(R) have both been prequalified recently. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reevaluated the costs and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Bangladesh, Ghana, and Malawi and compared Rotarix(R), ROTAVAC(R), and ROTASIIL(R) in each country. For consistency with previously published analyses in these countries, we used the same Excel-based cohort model and much of the same data as the original analyses. We varied the expected price (with and without Gavi subsidy), wastage, and incremental health system costs associated with each vaccine. We assumed the same efficacy and waning assumptions following administration of two or three doses for the respective product. RESULTS: The discounted cost per DALY averted compared to no vaccination ranged from 0.3 to 1.3 times GNI per capita for each vaccine. With the Gavi subsidy, the average cost-effectiveness ratios were below 0.3 times GNI per capita in all three countries. Though critical empirical cost data are not yet available, Rotarix(R) is the least costly and most cost-effective product in the countries examined in this modelling study. However, small decreases in the incremental health system cost for other products could result in cost and cost-effectiveness outcomes that match or surpass those of Rotarix(R). CONCLUSION: Countries may wish to consider new rotavirus vaccines entering the market. Countries should carefully examine multiple product attributes including price and the incremental health system costs associated with each vaccine.

31276,"Re-evaluating the cost and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Bangladesh, Ghana, and Malawi: A comparison of three rotavirus vaccines","INTRODUCTION: Diarrhea is a leading cause of mortality worldwide and rotavirus accounts for many of these deaths. As of August 2018, 96 countries have introduced rotavirus vaccines into their immunization programs. Two rotavirus vaccines, Rotarix(R) and RotaTeq(R), have been WHO-prequalified since 2009, with Rotarix(R) being the preferred product of most Gavi-supported countries. ROTAVAC(R) and ROTASIIL(R) have both been prequalified recently. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reevaluated the costs and cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Bangladesh, Ghana, and Malawi and compared Rotarix(R), ROTAVAC(R), and ROTASIIL(R) in each country. For consistency with previously published analyses in these countries, we used the same Excel-based cohort model and much of the same data as the original analyses. We varied the expected price (with and without Gavi subsidy), wastage, and incremental health system costs associated with each vaccine. We assumed the same efficacy and waning assumptions following administration of two or three doses for the respective product. RESULTS: The discounted cost per DALY averted compared to no vaccination ranged from 0.3 to 1.3 times GNI per capita for each vaccine. With the Gavi subsidy, the average cost-effectiveness ratios were below 0.3 times GNI per capita in all three countries. Though critical empirical cost data are not yet available, Rotarix(R) is the least costly and most cost-effective product in the countries examined in this modelling study. However, small decreases in the incremental health system cost for other products could result in cost and cost-effectiveness outcomes that match or surpass those of Rotarix(R). CONCLUSION: Countries may wish to consider new rotavirus vaccines entering the market. Countries should carefully examine multiple product attributes including price and the incremental health system costs associated with each vaccine.

31281,"Cost effectiveness of a community based prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition programme in Mumbai slums, India","Children in slums are at high risk of acute malnutrition and death. Cost-effectiveness of community-based management of severe acute malnutrition programmes has been demonstrated previously, but there is limited evidence in the context of urban slums where programme cost structure is likely to vary tremendously. This study assessed the cost-utility of adding a community based prevention and treatment for acute malnutrition intervention to Government of India Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) standard care for children in Mumbai slums. The intervention is delivered by community health workers in collaboration with ICDS Anganwadi community health workers. The analysis used a decision tree model to compare the costs and effects of the two options: standard ICDS services with the intervention and prevention versus standard ICDS services alone. The model used outcome and cost data from the Society for Nutrition, Education & Health Action''s Child Health and Nutrition programme in Mumbai slums, which delivered services to 12,362 children over one year from 2013 to 2014. An activity-based cost model was used, with calculated costs based on programme financial records and key informant interviews. Cost data were coupled with programme effectiveness data to estimate disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. The community based prevention and treatment programme averted 15,016 DALYs (95% Uncertainty Interval [UI]: 12,246-17,843) at an estimated cost of $23 per DALY averted (95%UI:19-28) and was thus highly cost-effective. This study shows that ICDS Anganwadi community health workers can work efficiently with community health workers to increase the prevention and treatment coverage in slums in India and can lead to policy recommendations at the state, and potentially the national level, to promote such programmes in Indian slums as a cost-effective approach to tackling moderate and severe acute malnutrition.",2018-99-28547,30412636,PLoS One,S Goudet,2018,13 / 11,e0205688,No,30412636,"S Goudet; A Jayaraman; S Chanani; D Osrin; B Devleesschauwer; B Bogin; N Madise; P Griffiths; Cost effectiveness of a community based prevention and treatment of acute malnutrition programme in Mumbai slums, India, PLoS One , 2018; 13(11):1932-6203; e0205688",DALY,India,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior, Other",Aahar acute malnutrition programme vs. Standard/Usual Care- Integrated Child Development Services standard care for children in Mumbai slums,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,23,United States,2014,25.14
31282,Impact and cost effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in India,"BACKGROUND: World Health Organization has recommended the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the childhood immunisation programme of all the countries in the world. In lieu of its introduction in India, there is a need to generate evidence on cost-effectiveness of this vaccine. The current study looks into the impact and cost-effectiveness of PCV vaccine in India. METHODS: We evaluated the cost effectiveness of implementation of PCV 13 vaccination program at national level by comparing with no vaccination program for a period of 10 birth cohorts from 2018 to 2027. UNIVAC, a deterministic static cohort model is developed by giving the conservative estimates of vaccine program related to mortality, disease event rates, vaccine efficacy and coverage projections, system and health care costs for the first five years of life. Cost effectiveness is reported as Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). Further scenario and sensitivity analysis were done. Probability of PCV intervention to be cost effective at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold equal to per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is calculated using the government perspective. RESULTS: We found that the introduction of PCV vaccination program can cost an additional $467 (INR 31,666) for averting per DALY which is less than one time GDP per capita of India. Even with the most unfavourable scenario for PCV vaccine, cost per DALY averted is found to be $2323 (INR 1,57,520) which is still a cost effective intervention in India. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found the ICER for PCV to be $649 (INR 44,008) with 95% CI: $374-$1161. CONCLUSION: This study shows that the PCV program is a highly cost effective intervention and justifies the introduction of PCV into routine immunisation schedule in some of the states and recommends introducing it throughout the country to reduce morbidity and mortality among the under-five children.",2019-01-04726,30587430,Fem.

31283,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Humanitarian Hand Surgery Trips According to WHO-CHOICE Thresholds,"PURPOSE: Hand surgery outreach programs to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) provide much-needed surgical care to the underserved populations and education to local providers for improved care. The cost-effectiveness of these surgical trips has not been studied despite a long history of such efforts. This study aimed to examine the economic impact of hand surgery trips to LMICs using data from the Touching Hands Project and ReSurge International. We hypothesized that hand surgery outreach would be cost-effective in LMICs. METHODS: We analyzed data on the cost of each trip and the surgical procedures performed. Using methods from the World Health Organization (WHO-Choosing Interventions That Are Cost-Effective [WHO-CHOICE]), we determined whether the procedures performed during the outreach trips would be cost-effective. RESULTS: For the 14 hand surgery trips, 378 patients received surgical treatment. Trips varied in the country where interventions were provided, the number of patients served, the severity of the conditions, and the total cost. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted ranged from United States (US)$222 to $1,525, all of which were very cost-effective according to WHO-CHOICE thresholds. The cost-effectiveness of global hand surgery was comparable to that of other medical interventions such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in similar regions. We also identified a lack of standardized record keeping for these surgical trips. CONCLUSIONS: Hand surgeries performed in LMICs are cost-effective based on WHO-CHOICE criteria. However, a standardized record-keeping method is needed for future research and longitudinal comparison.

Trips varied in the country where interventions were provided, the number of patients served, the severity of the conditions, and the total cost. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted ranged from United States (US)$222 to $1,525, all of which were very cost-effective according to WHO-CHOICE thresholds. The cost-effectiveness of global hand surgery was comparable to that of other medical interventions such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment in similar regions. We also identified a lack of standardized record keeping for these surgical trips. CONCLUSIONS: Hand surgeries performed in LMICs are cost-effective based on WHO-CHOICE criteria. However, a standardized record-keeping method is needed for future research and longitudinal comparison. Understanding the economic impact of hand surgery global outreach is important to the success and sustainability of these efforts, both to allocate resources effectively and to identify areas for improvement.

31297,Modelling the risk of transfusion-transmitted syphilis: a reconsideration of blood donation testing strategies,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Donor syphilis testing began in the 1940s amidst widespread transfusion-transmitted syphilis (TTS). Since then, the introduction of penicillin, pre-donation screening questionnaires and improved storage conditions have contributed to reducing transmission risk. Consequently, universal testing may no longer be cost-effective. This study analysed alternative options for donor syphilis testing to determine the optimal strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model was developed using conservative parameter estimates for factors affecting TTS and 2009-2015 Australian donations to calculate risk outcomes (TTS infections, tertiary syphilis in recipients and transfusion-associated congenital syphilis) and cost-effectiveness of alternative testing strategies. The strategies modelled were as follows: universal testing, targeted-testing of high-risk groups (males </=50 years old and first-time donors) and no testing. RESULTS: The estimated risk of TTS is one in 49.5 million transfusions for universal testing, one in 6 million for targeted-testing of males </=50 years old, one in 4 million for targeted-testing of first-time donors and one in 2.8 million for no testing. For all strategies, the risk of tertiary and congenital syphilis is <1 in 100 million. Universal testing is the least cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimated at $538.5 million per disability-adjusted life year averted. CONCLUSION: Universal testing is not required to maintain the risk of TTS within tolerable limits and is estimated to greatly exceed acceptable ICERs for blood safety interventions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model was developed using conservative parameter estimates for factors affecting TTS and 2009-2015 Australian donations to calculate risk outcomes (TTS infections, tertiary syphilis in recipients and transfusion-associated congenital syphilis) and cost-effectiveness of alternative testing strategies. The strategies modelled were as follows: universal testing, targeted-testing of high-risk groups (males </=50 years old and first-time donors) and no testing. RESULTS: The estimated risk of TTS is one in 49.5 million transfusions for universal testing, one in 6 million for targeted-testing of males </=50 years old, one in 4 million for targeted-testing of first-time donors and one in 2.8 million for no testing. For all strategies, the risk of tertiary and congenital syphilis is <1 in 100 million. Universal testing is the least cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimated at $538.5 million per disability-adjusted life year averted. CONCLUSION: Universal testing is not required to maintain the risk of TTS within tolerable limits and is estimated to greatly exceed acceptable ICERs for blood safety interventions. However, despite a strong economic and risk-based rationale, given the epidemiology of syphilis in Australia is changing, feedback from critical stakeholders is not currently supportive of reducing testing.",2019-99-28187,30565234,Vox Sang,Thisuri Jayawardena,2019,114 / 2,107-116,No,30565234,"Thisuri Jayawardena; Veronica Hoad; Claire Styles; Clive Seed; Peter Bentley; Vanessa Clifford; Sarina Lacey; Tessa Gastrell; Modelling the risk of transfusion-transmitted syphilis: a reconsideration of blood donation testing strategies, Vox Sang, 2019 Feb; 114(2):0042-9007; 107-116",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,Screening,Targeted testing: testing first-time blood donors for syphilis vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,,5.00,5.00,206500000,Australia,2016,165598209.44
31300,Implications of scaling up cardiovascular disease treatment in South Africa: a microsimulation and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases and their risk factors-particularly hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and diabetes-have become an increasing concern for middle-income countries. Using newly available, nationally representative data, we assessed how cardiovascular risk factors are distributed across subpopulations within South Africa and identified which cardiovascular treatments should be prioritised. METHODS: We created a demographically representative simulated population for South Africa and used data from 17 743 respondents aged 15 years or older of the 2012 South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES) to assign information on cardiovascular risk factors to each member of the simulated population. We created a microsimulation model to estimate the health and economic implications of two globally recognised treatment recommendations: WHO''s package of essential non-communicable disease interventions (PEN) and South Africa''s Primary Care 101 (SA PC 101) guidelines. The primary outcome was total disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted through treatment of all cardiovascular disease or microvascular type 2 diabetes complications per 1000 population. We compared outcomes at the aspirational level of achieving access to treatment among 70% of the population. FINDINGS: Based on the SANHANES data, South Africans had a high prevalence of hypertension (24.8%), dyslipidaemia (17.5%), and diabetes (15.3%). Prevalence was disproportionately high and treatment low among male, black, and poor populations. Our simulated population experienced a burden of 40.0 DALYs (95% CI 29.5-52.0) per 1000 population per year from cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes complications at current treatment levels, which lowered to 32.9 DALYs (24.4-44.7) under WHO PEN implementation and to 32.5 (24.4-44.8) under SA PC 101 implementation. Under both guidelines, there were increases in blood pressure treatment (4.2 percentage points under WHO PEN vs 12.6 percentage points under SA PC 101), lipid treatment (16.0 vs 14.9), and glucose control medications (1.2 vs 0.6). The incremental cost-effectiveness of implementing SA PC 101 over current treatment would be a saving of US$24 902 (95% CI 14 666-62 579) per DALY averted compared with a saving of $17 587 (1840-42 589) under WHO PEN guidelines. INTERPRETATION: Cardiovascular risk factors are common and disproportionate among disadvantaged populations in South Africa. Treatment with blood pressure agents and statins might need greater prioritisation than blood glucose therapies, which contrasts with observed treatment levels despite a lower monthly cost of blood pressure or statin treatment than of sulfonylurea or insulin treatment.
