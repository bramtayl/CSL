16501,Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardiac devices in patients with systolic heart failure,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), cardiac resynchronisation therapy pacemakers (CRT-Ps) and combination therapy (CRT-D) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction based on a range of clinical characteristics. METHODS: Individual patient data from 13 randomised trials were used to inform a decision analytical model. A series of regression equations were used to predict baseline all-cause mortality, hospitalisation rates and health-related quality of life and device-related treatment effects. Clinical variables used in these equations were age, QRS duration, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ischaemic aetiology and left bundle branch block (LBBB). A UK National Health Service perspective and a lifetime time horizon were used. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Results were reported for 24 subgroups based on LBBB status, QRS duration and NYHA class. RESULTS: At a threshold of pound30 000 per QALY gained, CRT-D was cost-effective in 10 of the 24 subgroups including all LBBB morphology patients with NYHA I/II/III. ICD is cost-effective for all non-NYHA IV patients with QRS duration <120 ms and for NYHA I/II non-LBBB morphology patients with QRS duration between 120 ms and 149 ms. CRT-P was also cost-effective in all NYHA III/IV patients with QRS duration >120 ms. Device therapy is cost-effective in most patient groups with LBBB at a threshold of pound20 000 per QALY gained. Results were robust to altering key model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: At a threshold of pound30 000 per QALY gained, CRT-D is cost-effective in a far wider group than previously recommended in the UK. In some subgroups ICD and CRT-P remain the cost-effective choice.",2016-01-22571,27411837,Heart,Stuart Mealing,2016,102 / 21,1742-1749,No,27411837,"Stuart Mealing; Beth Woods; Neil Hawkins; Martin R Cowie; Christopher J Plummer; William T Abraham; John F Beshai; Helmut Klein; Mark Sculpher; Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardiac devices in patients with systolic heart failure, Heart, 2016 Nov 01; 102(21):1468-201X; 1742-1749",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Stand-alone CRT device (CRT-P) vs. Medical Therapy (MT),"Individuals without LBBB (left bundle branch block) morphology, NYHA (New York Heart Association) III, QRS duration =150 ms, with reduced ejection fraction",Not Stated,66 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,13930,United Kingdom,2014,25103.91

16518,Development of an enhanced health-economic model and cost-effectiveness analysis of tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat(R) fixed-dose combination for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients in Italy,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of the fixed-dose combination (FDC) of tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat((R)) FDC with tiotropium alone for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the Italian health care setting using a newly developed patient-level Markov model that reflects the current understanding of the disease. METHODS: While previously published models have largely been based around a cohort approach using a Markov structure and GOLD stage stratification, an individual-level Markov approach was selected for the new model. Using patient-level data from the twin TOnado trials assessing Tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat((R)) FDC versus tiotropium, outcomes were modelled based on the trough forced expiratory volume (tFEV1) of over 1000 patients in each treatment arm, tracked individually at trial visits through the 52-week trial period, and after the trial period it was assumed to decline at a constant rate based on disease stage. Exacerbation risk was estimated based on a random-effects logistic regression analysis of exacerbations in UPLIFT. Mortality by age and disease stage was estimated from an analysis of TIOSPIR trial data. Cost of bronchodilators and other medications, routine management, and costs of treatment for moderate and severe exacerbations for the Italian setting were included. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted over a 15-year time horizon from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. RESULTS: Aggregating total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each treatment cohort over 15 years and comparing tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat((R)) FDC with tiotropium alone, resulted in mean incremental costs per patient of euro1167 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro7518 per additional QALY with tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat((R)) FDC. The lung function outcomes observed for tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat((R)) FDC in TOnado drove the results in terms of slightly higher mean life-years (12.24 versus 12.07) exacerbation-free months (11.36 versus 11.32) per patient and slightly fewer moderate and severe exacerbations per patient-year (0.411 versus 0.415; 0.21 versus 0.24) versus tiotropium. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed tiotropium + olodaterol Respimat((R)) FDC to be the more cost-effective treatment in 95.2% and 98.4% of 500 simulations at thresholds of euro20,000 and euro30,000 per QALY respectively.

Typically, studies evaluating the use of antibiotics focus on immediate costs of care, and do not account for the wider implications of antimicrobial resistance. AIM: This study sought to establish whether antibiotics (principally amoxicillin) are cost effective in patients with LRTIs, and to explore the implications of taking into account costs associated with resistance. DESIGN AND SETTING: Multinational randomised double-blinded trial in 2060 patients with acute cough/LRTIs recruited in 12 European countries. METHOD: A cost-utility analysis from a health system perspective with a time horizon of 28 days was conducted. The primary outcome measure was the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Hierarchical modelling was used to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Amoxicillin was associated with an ICER of euro8216 ( pound6540) per QALY gained when the cost of resistance was excluded. If the cost of resistance is greater than euro11 ( pound9) per patient, then amoxicillin treatment is no longer cost effective.

16522,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of d-Nav for People with Diabetes at High Risk of Neuropathic Foot Ulcers,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the d-Nav Insulin Guidance Service (Hygieia Inc.), a system designed to improve glycemic control via the use of insulin titration, in people with diabetes at risk of developing neuropathic foot ulcers. METHODS: A Markov model containing four health states (no ulcer, uninfected ulcer, infected ulcer, and amputation) was developed to compare d-Nav with current National Health Service standard care. Patient movement between the health states was governed by event rates taken from the wider literature. Both the healing rate for uninfected ulcers and the rate of recurrence for uninfected ulcers were directly influenced by the patient''s glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Separate mean HbA1c values were assigned to treatment and control patients and taken from a single-arm study that examined the effect of d-Nav on the outcomes of 122 patients, with HbA1c for control patients based on values recorded in the 12-month period prior to the study and HbA1c for d-Nav based on values recorded during the trial. Weekly cycles were applied, and patient resource use and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated over a 3-year time horizon. Univariate sensitivity analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: In the base case, d-Nav was cost-saving and produced more QALYs than standard care, with a total net monetary benefit value of pound1459 per patient. Univariate analysis indicated that the model results are relatively robust to variations in underlying parameters, with patient HbA1c having the most significant impact on outcomes. CONCLUSION: Interventions that aim to improve glycemic control, such as d-Nav, appear to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources when targeted at those with poor glycemic control at high risk of developing foot ulcers.

16529,Mechanical thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: The beneficial effects of endovascular treatment with new-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices compared with intravenous thrombolysis alone to treat acute large-artery ischemic stroke have been shown in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This study aimed to estimate the cost utility of mechanical thrombectomy compared with the established standard of care. METHODS: We developed a Markov decision process analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of treatment with mechanical thrombectomy plus intravenous thrombolysis versus treatment with intravenous thrombolysis alone from the public payer perspective in Canada. We conducted comprehensive literature searches to populate model inputs. We estimated the efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy plus intravenous thrombolysis from a meta-analysis of 5 RCTs, and we used data from the Oxford Vascular Study to model long-term clinical outcomes. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) using a 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed the cost and effectiveness of treatment with mechanical thrombectomy plus intravenous thrombolysis to be $126939 and 1.484 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), respectively, and the cost and effectiveness of treatment with intravenous thrombolysis alone to be $124419 and 1.273 QALYs, respectively. The mechanical thrombectomy plus intravenous thrombolysis strategy was associated with an ICER of $11990 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of treatment with mechanical thrombectomy plus intravenous thrombolysis being cost-effective was 57.5%, 89.7% and 99.6% at thresholds of $20000, $50000 and $100000 per QALY gained, respectively. The main factors influencing the ICER were time horizon, extra cost of mechanical thrombectomy treatment and age of the patient.

16530,A cost effective analysis of fixed-dose combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin compared with dutasteride monotherapy for benign prostatic hyperplasia in Nigeria: a middle income perspective; using an interactive Markov model,"BACKGROUND: The number of Nigerian men presenting with benign prostatic hyperplasia is on the rise because of increase awareness about the ailment. With the renewed effort by the national health insurance scheme to cover the informal sector, it becomes imperative to determine the cost implication for managing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH) and the cost effective drug combination to be adopted. The objective of this study is to estimate cost effective analysis (CEA) of fixed -dose combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin compared with dutasteride monotherapy from the health service provider perspective design. METHODS: An interactive Markov''s model was used to generate incremental cost per QALY and incremental cost per life years gained. 2.9 million Men who were 50 years of age were fed into the model. The outcome measures included: costs of drug treatment, consultation, acute urinary retention (AUR), transurethral resection of prostate (TURP), hospitalisation post TURP, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost per life years gained, and incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Fixed-dose combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin (FDCT) produced an Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of US$1481.92 per Quality adjusted for life-years saved. CONCLUSION: Universal FDCT provision for Nigeria has major economic implications. This study in the context of its limitations has demonstrated the cost effectiveness of FDCT for the long term treatment of patients with moderate to severe BPH from the perspective of a developing country. Currently, there are few studies available to give economic data evidence to policy makers in Nigeria which is applicable to developing countries with similar economies.

We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of some newer combination therapies in cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cost effectiveness decision model was used to analyze Gynecologic Oncology Group 240. All regimens were modeled for seven cycles. The regimens studied are as follows: regimen 1, cisplatin/paclitaxel (CP); regimen 2, CP with bevacizumab (CP+B); regimen 3, paclitaxel/topotecan (PT); and regimen 4, PT with bevacizumab (PT+B). Overall survival, cost, and complications were studied. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Mean chemotherapy costs over mean total costs for seven cycles of each follows: CP $571/$32,966; CP+B $61,671/$96,842; PT $9,211/$71,620; and PT+B $70,312/$109,211.

16533,Is the routine use of bevacizumab in the treatment of women with advanced or recurrent cancer of the cervix sustainable?,"BACKGROUND: New chemotherapy combinations are being tested for the treatment of women with advanced, persistent or recurrent cervical cancer. We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of some newer combination therapies in cervical cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cost effectiveness decision model was used to analyze Gynecologic Oncology Group 240. All regimens were modeled for seven cycles. The regimens studied are as follows: regimen 1, cisplatin/paclitaxel (CP); regimen 2, CP with bevacizumab (CP+B); regimen 3, paclitaxel/topotecan (PT); and regimen 4, PT with bevacizumab (PT+B). Overall survival, cost, and complications were studied. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Mean chemotherapy costs over mean total costs for seven cycles of each follows: CP $571/$32,966; CP+B $61,671/$96,842; PT $9,211/$71,620; and PT+B $70,312/$109,211. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CP+B was $133,559/quality adjusted life year (QALY). ICER for PT+B was $124,576/QALY. To achieve an incremental ICER for CP+B:CP of <$50,000/QALY gained, the mean overall survival has to increase from 1.1 years with CP to 3.5 years with CP+B. An ICER <$50,000/QALY for the other regimens would take a survival of >10 years for PT and 4.1 years for PT+B. Treating 1,000 women with cervical cancer with CP+B would cost almost double the cost of treating >18,000 women with ovarian cancer annually (carboplatin/paclitaxel).

16539,Cost-effectiveness analysis of rifaximin-alpha administration for the reduction of episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy in recurrence compared with standard treatment in France,"BACKGROUND: Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome that occurs most often in a context of acute or chronic liver disease. Despite the seriousness of the pathology, only a few treatments have been developed for improving its management. Rifaximin-alpha is the first treatment that has been clinically developed for overt HE (OHE) episodes. Recent results of clinical studies demonstrated its significant improvement in the health-related quality of life. The objective of the current study was to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of rifaximin-alpha used in combination with lactulose compared with lactulose monotherapy in cirrhotic patients, who have experienced at least two prior OHE events. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate rifaximin-alpha cost-effectiveness, evaluating it from the perspective of all contributors as recommended by French health technology assessment guidelines. Costs were based on current French treatment practices. The transition between health states was based on the reanalysis of the rifaximin-alpha pivotal clinical trials RFHE3001 and RFHE3002. The main outcome of the model was cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: The results indicate that rifaximin-alpha is a cost-effective treatment option with an incremental cost per QALY gained of euro19,187 and euro18,517 over two different time horizons (2 and 5 years). The robustness of the model was studied using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: For the societal willingness to pay threshold of euro27,000 per QALY gained, rifaximin-alpha in combination with lactulose is a cost-effective and affordable treatment for patients who have experienced at least two prior overt HE episodes.",2016-01-22643,27366216,Therap Adv Gastroenterol,Anastasiia Kabeshova,2016,9 / 4,473-82,No,27366216,"Anastasiia Kabeshova; Soumaia Ben Hariz; Elyonore Tsakeu; Robert Benamouzig; Robert Launois; Cost-effectiveness analysis of rifaximin-alpha administration for the reduction of episodes of overt hepatic encephalopathy in recurrence compared with standard treatment in France, Therap Adv Gastroenterol, 2016 Jul; 9(4):1756-283X; 473-82",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rifaximin-alpha and lactulose vs. Standard/Usual Care- Lactulose Monotherapy,"In remission from previous episodes of Overt Hepatic Encephalopathy, associated with hepatic cirrhosis (equivalent to Conn score >=2)",Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 2 Years",Not Stated,Not Stated,18517,Euro,2014,26917.4

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed 97 consecutive BioPro metallic hemiarthroplasties performed in 80 patients for end-stage hallux rigidus, with a minimum follow-up of five years. There were 19 men and 61 women; their mean age was 55 years (22 to 74). No patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients (15 first metatarso-phalangeal joints (MTPJs)) required a revision; one for infection, two for osteolysis and 12 for pain. The all cause rate of survival at five years was 85.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 83.5 to 87.9). Younger age was a significant predictor of revision (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.17, p = 0.014) on excluding infection and adjusting for confounding variables (Cox regression). Significant improvements were demonstrated at five years in the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire (13.9, 95% CI 10.5 to 17.2) and in the physical component of the Short Form-12 score (6.5, 95% CI 4.1 to 8.9). The overall rate of satisfaction was 75%. The cost per quality adjusted life year at five years, accounting for a 14% rate of revision was between pound4431 and pound6361 depending on the complexity and morbidity of the patient. CONCLUSION: The BioPro hemiarthroplasty offers good short to mid-term functional outcome and is a cost effective intervention. The relatively high revision rate is associated with younger age and perhaps the use of this implant should be limited to older patients.

16542,Cost-Effectiveness of Apixaban versus Warfarin in Chinese Patients with Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation: A Real-Life and Modelling Analyses,"OBJECTIVES: Many of the cost-effectiveness analyses of apixaban against warfarin focused on Western populations but Asian evidence remains less clear. The present study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban against warfarin in Chinese patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) from a public institutional perspective in Hong Kong. METHODS: We used a Markov model incorporating 12 health state transitions, and simulated the disease progression of NVAF in 1,000 hypothetical patients treated with apixaban/warfarin. Risks of clinical events were based on the ARISTOTLE trial and were adjusted with local International Normalized Ratio control, defined as the time in therapeutic range. Real-life input for the model, including patients'' demographics and clinical profiles, post-event treatment patterns, and healthcare costs, were determined by a retrospective cohort of 40,569 incident patients retrieved from a Hong Kong-wide electronic medical database. Main outcome measurements included numbers of thromboembolic and bleeding events, life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct healthcare cost. When comparing apixaban and warfarin, treatment with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) less than one local GDP per capita (USD 33,534 in 2014) was defined to be cost-effective. RESULTS: In the lifetime simulation, fewer numbers of events were estimated for the apixaban group, resulting in reduced event-related direct medical costs. The estimated ICER of apixaban was USD 7,057 per QALY at base-case analysis and ranged from USD 1,061 to 14,867 per QALY under the 116 tested scenarios in deterministic sensitivity analysis. While in probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of apixaban being the cost-effective alternative to warfarin was 96% and 98% at a willingness to pay threshold of USD 33,534 and 100,602 per QALY, respectively.

16543,The cost-effectiveness of exenatide twice daily (BID) vs insulin lispro three times daily (TID) as add-on therapy to titrated insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of exenatide twice daily (BID) vs bolus insulin lispro three times daily (TID) as add-on therapy when glycemic control is sub-optimal with titrated basal insulin glargine and metformin. METHODS: The analysis was based on the recent 4B Study, which compared exenatide BID and lispro TID as add-on therapies in subjects with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled, despite titrated insulin glargine. The Cardiff Diabetes Model was used to simulate patient costs and health benefits beyond the 4B Study. The Swedish healthcare perspective was adopted for this analysis; costs are reported in euroEUR to aid interpretation. The main outcome measure was the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with exenatide BID compared to lispro TID. RESULTS: Exenatide BID was associated with an incremental cost of euro1,270 and a QALY increase of +0.64 compared with lispro TID over 40 years. The cost per QALY gained with exenatide BID compared with lispro TID was euro1,971, which is within conventional limits of cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness results were generally robust to alternative assumptions and values for key model parameters. LIMITATIONS: Extrapolation of trial data over the longer term can be influenced by modeling and parameter uncertainty. Cost-effectiveness results were generally insensitive to alternative values of key model input parameters and across scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of exenatide BID rather than insulin lispro to basal insulin is associated with similar or better clinical outcomes. Illustrated from the Swedish healthcare perspective, analysis with the Cardiff Diabetes Model demonstrated that exenatide BID represents a cost-effective treatment alternative to lispro TID as add-on therapy in type 2 diabetes patients insufficiently controlled on basal insulin.",2016-01-22656,27356188,J Med Econ,J Gordon,2016,19 / 12,1167-1174,Yes,27356188,"J Gordon; P McEwan; U Sabale; B Kartman; B H R Wolffenbuttel; The cost-effectiveness of exenatide twice daily (BID) vs insulin lispro three times daily (TID) as add-on therapy to titrated insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes, J Med Econ, 2016 Dec; 19(12):1369-6998; 1167-1174",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exenatide twice daily (BID) as add-on-therapy to titrated basal insulin glargine and metformin vs. bolus insulin lispro three times daily (TID) as add-on-therapy to titrated basal insulin glargine and metformin,inadequately controlled hyperglycemia,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1971,Euro,2015,2388.4
16544,"Cost-effectiveness of tiotropium versus glycopyrronium in moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Canada, Spain, Sweden, and the UK","OBJECTIVES: Tiotropium (TIO), Spiriva(R) Handihaler(R), is a well-established bronchodilator, LAMA (long acting muscarinic antagonist), for the treatment of moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Clinical evidence from the SPARK trial suggests that TIO is superior to glycopyrronium (GLY), Seebri(R) Breezhaler(R), in terms of severe exacerbations. This modeling study assessed the cost-effectiveness of TIO versus GLY for Canada (CAN), Spain (ESP), Sweden (SWE), and the UK, making use of this new clinical evidence. METHODS: A Markov cohort model, with moderate to very severe (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease II-IV) COPD patients, was populated with efficacy data from the Understanding Potential Long-term Impacts on Function with Tiotropium (UPLIFT) and SPARK trials as well as costs, utilities, and epidemiological data relevant for each country. Treatment efficacy was modeled as improvements in lung function, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and as a lowering of the risk of exacerbations (rate of exacerbations). Risks of exacerbations differed between cohorts based on data from SPARK. Health and cost outcomes were simulated over an approximate lifetime horizon, starting from the age of 65 years. Robustness of results was validated in deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Over the lifetime horizon, patients treated with TIO accumulated -623 (CAN), 1,066 (ESP), 1,137 (SWE), and -169 (UK), respectively, in incremental costs (euro2014). TIO generated better health outcomes compared to GLY in all countries, 0.21 (CAN), 0.25 (ESP), 0.23 (SWE), and 0.23 (UK) in incremental QALYs. The cost per QALY gained was found to be euro4,281 and euro1,137 for ESP and SWE, respectively, while TIO was found to be cost saving in CAN and the UK.

This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of universal post-treatment testing to confirm eradication of H. pylori infection in adults. METHODS: Decision-analytic models evaluated the cost-effectiveness of universal post-treatment testing (urea breath test [UBT] or monoclonal fecal antigen test [mFAT]) vs no testing (Model 1), and UBT vs mFAT after adjusting for patient adherence to testing (Model 2) in adults who previously received first-line antimicrobial therapy. Patients testing positive received second-line quadruple therapy; no further action was taken for those testing negative or with no testing (Model 1) or for those nonadherent to testing (Model 2). In addition to testing costs, excess lifetime costs and reduced quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) due to continuing H. pylori infection were considered in the model. RESULTS: Expected total costs per patient were higher for post-treatment testing (UBT: US$325.76; mFAT: US$242.12) vs no testing (US$182.41) in Model 1 and for UBT (US$336.75) vs mFAT (US$326.24) in Model 2.

METHODS: RA patients starting their first bDMARD and comparator patients using csDMARDs during 2007-11 were obtained from the National register of biologic treatments in Finland and the Jyvaskyla Central Hospital patient records. Propensity score matching was applied to adjust for differences between bDMARD and csDMARD users. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and based on the register of biologic treatments in Finland and Jyvaskyla Central Hospital patient records, whereas the direct costs were obtained from relevant Finnish national registers. Patients were followed up for 2 years, and both costs and effectiveness for the second year were discounted at 3%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with 95% CI was calculated based on bootstrapped mean costs and effectiveness. RESULTS: Of 1581 RA patients meeting study inclusion criteria, 552 bDMARD and 220 csDMARD users were included in analyses after matching. Mean costs for bDMARDs and csDMARDs were euro55 371 and euro24 879, while mean effectiveness was 1.23 and 1.20 QALYs, respectively. Consequent ICER was euro902 210/QALY. Results were confirmed in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The high incremental cost and the small, non-significant difference in effectiveness resulted in high ICER, suggesting that bDMARDs are not cost-effective.

16552,Early neurologically focused follow-up after cardiac arrest is cost-effective: A trial-based economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an early intervention service for cardiac arrest survivors called ''Stand still ..., and move on'' from a societal perspective. INTERVENTION: This concise nursing intervention consists of screening for cognitive and emotional problems, information provision and support, self-management promotion, and further referral if necessary. Earlier research confirmed the feasibility of the intervention and its effectiveness in improving emotional functioning and quality of life. METHODS: In this multicentre randomized controlled trial with one year follow-up 185 patients were included between April 2007 and December 2010. The experimental group received the intervention, the control group received care-as-usual. Intervention costs, other direct healthcare costs (e.g. hospital care, rehabilitation, medication, home care) and indirect costs (productivity loss) were measured during ten months using monthly cost-diaries. The economic evaluation comprised a cost-utility analysis (SF-36) and a cost-effectiveness analysis (QOLIBRI) using bootstrapping (5000 replications) to quantify uncertainty concerning the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was estimated. To check the robustness of the findings, two sensitivity analyses were performed using the EQ-5D and the complete cases respectively. RESULTS: Of 136 (74%) participants sufficient data concerning costs were collected to be included in this economic evaluation. Intervention costs were on average euro127 (SD 85). No significant differences between groups were found with regard to overall costs. The ICERs of the cost-utility and the cost-effectiveness analyses supported the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 54-76% for the SF-36 and 94% for the QOLIBRI. Findings were robust. CONCLUSION: The intervention ''Stand still ..., and move on'' has positive societal economic effects and has a high probability to be cost-effective.

Although 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) are available in China, the costs are borne by the consumer, resulting in low coverage for PCV-7. We aimed to conduct a simulation study to assess the cost-effectiveness and health benefits of PCV-7, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) and PPV-23 to prevent childhood pneumonia and other vaccine-preventive diseases in China. METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed using a Markov simulation model. Parameters including demographic, epidemiological data, costs and efficacy of vaccines were obtained from previous studies. A hypothetical cohort of 100,000 newborns (focusing on pneumococcal diseases </=7 years old) was followed up until death or 100 years of age. The model incorporated the impact of vaccination on reduction of incidence of pneumococcal diseases and mortality of children </=7 years. Outcomes are presented in terms of disease cases averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, PPV-23 is currently the only cost-effective option, while PCV-13 showed the greatest impact on pneumococcal disease burden, reducing invasive pneumococcal diseases by 31.3%, pneumonia by 15.3% and gaining 73.8 QALYs (10,000 individuals at discount rate of 3%). ICERs of PCV-13 and PCV-7 are US$29,460/QALY and US$104,094/QALY, respectively, showing no cost-effectiveness based on the World Health Organization recommended willingness-to-pay threshold. On the other hand, the ICERs of PCVs were most sensitive to vaccination costs: if it reduces 4.7% and 32.2% for PCV-7 and PCV-13 respectively, the vaccination will be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: To scale up current vaccination strategies and achieve potential health benefits, the replacement of PCV-7 with PCV-13 should be considered.

On the other hand, the ICERs of PCVs were most sensitive to vaccination costs: if it reduces 4.7% and 32.2% for PCV-7 and PCV-13 respectively, the vaccination will be cost-effective.

16555,"Cost-Effectiveness and Health Benefits of Pediatric 23-Valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine, 7-Valent and Forecasting 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines in China","BACKGROUND: Each year in China, approximately 700,000 children under 5 years old are diagnosed with pneumonia, and 30,000 die from the disease. Although 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) are available in China, the costs are borne by the consumer, resulting in low coverage for PCV-7. We aimed to conduct a simulation study to assess the cost-effectiveness and health benefits of PCV-7, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) and PPV-23 to prevent childhood pneumonia and other vaccine-preventive diseases in China. METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed using a Markov simulation model. Parameters including demographic, epidemiological data, costs and efficacy of vaccines were obtained from previous studies. A hypothetical cohort of 100,000 newborns (focusing on pneumococcal diseases </=7 years old) was followed up until death or 100 years of age. The model incorporated the impact of vaccination on reduction of incidence of pneumococcal diseases and mortality of children </=7 years. Outcomes are presented in terms of disease cases averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, PPV-23 is currently the only cost-effective option, while PCV-13 showed the greatest impact on pneumococcal disease burden, reducing invasive pneumococcal diseases by 31.3%, pneumonia by 15.3% and gaining 73.8 QALYs (10,000 individuals at discount rate of 3%).

16562,Cost-Effectiveness of Genotype 1 Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Treatments in Patients Coinfected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus in the United States,"INTRODUCTION: New treatments for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) are highly effective in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of treatments for genotype 1 (GT1) HCV in HIV-coinfected patients. METHODS: A Markov model based on HCV natural history was used. The base-case analysis included both treatment-naive and -experienced patients. Alternatives were ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, dasabuvir with or without ribavirin (3D +/- R) for 12 or 24 weeks, sofosbuvir plus peginterferon and R (SOF + PR) for 12 weeks, SOF + R for 24 weeks, and no treatment (NT). A subgroup analysis restricted to treatment-naive, non-cirrhotic patients compared 3D +/- R for 12 weeks to SOF plus ledipasvir (LDV) for 12 weeks and NT. Transition probabilities, utilities, and costs were obtained from the published literature. Outcomes were measured over a lifetime horizon and included rates of compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related death, total costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In the base-case, SOF + R was dominated by both SOF + PR and 3D +/- R. Compared to SOF + PR, 3D +/- R had an ICER of $45,581. The lifetime rates of liver morbidity and mortality were lower among those treated with 3D +/- R compared to SOF + PR, SOF + R, or NT.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study from real-world data. SETTING: Electronic patient letters were searched for patients with a diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis and a formal outpatient STD prior to the availability of TAVI (1999-2009). The second group comprised the first 90 cases of TAVI in South Wales (2009 onwards). 2 years prior to and 5 years following TAVI/STD were assessed. Patient data were pseudoanonymised, using the Secure Anonymized Information Linkage (SAIL) databank, and extracted from Office National Statistics (ONS), Patient-Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) and general practitioner databases. POPULATION: 90 patients who had undergone TAVI in South Wales, and 65 STD patients who were medically managed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival, hospital admission frequency and length of stay, primary care visits, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: TAVI patients were significantly older (81.8 vs 79.2), more likely to be male (59.1% vs 49.3%), baseline comorbidities were balanced. Mortality in TAVI versus STD was 28% vs 70% at 1000 days follow-up. There were significantly more hospital admissions per year in the TAVI group prior to TAVI/STD (1.5 (IQR 1.0-2.4) vs 1.0 IQR (0.5-1.5)). Post TAVI/STD, the TAVI group had significantly lower hospital admissions (0.3 (IQR 0.0-1.0) vs 1.2 (IQR 0.7-3.0)) and lengths of stay (0.4 (IQR 0.0-13.8) vs 11.0 (IQR 2.5-28.5), p<0.05). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for TAVI was pound10 533 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).

16568,Cost-effectiveness of amlodipine compared with valsartan in preventing stroke and myocardial infarction among hypertensive patients in Taiwan,"Hypertension is a major risk factor for strokes and myocardial infarction (MI). Given its effectiveness and safety profile, the calcium channel blocker amlodipine is among the most frequently prescribed antihypertensive drugs. This analysis was conducted to determine the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with the use of amlodipine and valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, in preventing stroke and MI in Taiwanese hypertensive patients. A state transition (Markov) model was developed to compare the 5-year costs and QALYs for amlodipine and valsartan. Effectiveness data were based on the NAGOYA HEART Study, local studies, and a published meta-analysis. Utility data and costs of MI and stroke were retrieved from the published literature. Medical costs were based on the literature and inflated to 2011 prices; drug costs were based on National Health Insurance prices in 2014. A 3% discount rate was used for costs and QALYs and a third-party payer perspective adopted. One-way sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted. Compared with valsartan, amlodipine was associated with cost savings of New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) 2,251 per patient per year: costs were NTD 4,296 and NTD 6,547 per patient per year for amlodipine and valsartan users, respectively. Fewer cardiovascular events were reported in patients receiving amlodipine versus valsartan (342 vs 413 per 10,000 patients over 5 years, respectively). Amlodipine had a net gain of 58 QALYs versus valsartan per 10,000 patients over 5 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the discount rate and cohort age had a larger effect on total cost and cost difference than on QALYs. However, amlodipine results were more favorable than valsartan irrespective of discount rate or cohort age. When administered to Taiwanese patients for hypertension control, amlodipine was associated with lower cost and more QALYs compared with valsartan due to a lower risk of stroke and MI events.",2016-01-22710,27330323,Int J Gen Med,Lung Chan,2016,9 /,175-82,No,27330323,"Lung Chan; Chen-Huan Chen; Juey-Jen Hwang; San-Jou Yeh; Kou-Gi Shyu; Ruey-Tay Lin; Yi-Heng Li; Larry Z Liu; Jim Z Li; Wen-Yi Shau; Te-Chang Weng; Cost-effectiveness of amlodipine compared with valsartan in preventing stroke and myocardial infarction among hypertensive patients in Taiwan, Int J Gen Med, 2016; 9():1178-7074; 175-82",QALY,Taiwan,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Amlodipine (5/10 mg), a calcium channel blocker vs. Valsartan (80/160 mg), a angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)",Not Stated,Not Stated,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-38.84,Taiwan,2011,-1.53
16569,Simulation-Based Estimates of the Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Pulmonary Rehabilitation in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease in France,"BACKGROUND: The medico-economic impact of pulmonary rehabilitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is poorly documented. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation in a hypothetical cohort of COPD patients. METHODS: We used a multi-state Markov model, adopting society''s perspective. Simulated cohorts of French GOLD stage 2 to 4 COPD patients with and without pulmonary rehabilitation were compared in terms of life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), disease-related costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses included variations of key model parameters. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: At the horizon of a COPD patient''s remaining lifetime, pulmonary rehabilitation would result in mean gain of 0.8 QALY, with an over disease-related costs of 14 102 euro per patient. The ICER was 17 583 euro/QALY. Sensitivity analysis showed that pulmonary rehabilitation was cost-effective in every scenario (ICER <50 000 euro/QALY).

16570,Short-term cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir and insulin aspart in people with type 1 diabetes who are prone to recurrent severe hypoglycemia,"OBJECTIVE: Based on the data of the HypoAna trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00346996), a short-term cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted comparing an all insulin analogue regimen with an all human insulin regimen in people with type 1 diabetes who are prone to recurrent severe hypoglycemia. METHODS: Clinical data from the HypoAna trial and Danish cost data related to the treatment of severe hypoglycemia were used to populate a 1-year cost-effectiveness analysis. Hypoglycemia quality-of-life data were based on previously published utility values, used to calculate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the analysis. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The insulin analogue regimen was associated with greater total costs compared with the human insulin regimen (20,418 DKK [1972 GBP] vs. 18,558 DKK [1793 GBP], respectively), primarily driven by the difference in insulin costs. Total costs for corrective actions for hypoglycemic events, however, were lower in the insulin analogue group (927 DKK [89 GBP]) compared with the human insulin group (1311 DKK [127 GBP]), primarily due to a lower event rate. QALYs were higher with insulin analogues vs. human insulin (difference 0.0672). The resulting ICER was 27,685 DKK (2674 GBP) per QALY gained, which is well below the generally accepted cost-effectiveness threshold.

16571,Mirabegron for the treatment of overactive bladder: cost-effectiveness from US commercial health-plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The first class of oral pharmacologic treatments for overactive bladder (OAB) are antimuscarinics that are associated with poor persistence, anticholinergic adverse events, and increased anticholinergic burden (ACB) with risk of cognitive impairment. Mirabegron, a beta3-adrenoceptor agonist, is an oral treatment that does not contribute to ACB and has early evidence of improved persistence. The objective of the analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of mirabegron for OAB vs six antimuscarinics in the US. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model assessed US commercial health-plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives over a 3-year time horizon in an OAB patient population. Transition probabilities between five micturition and five incontinence severity states were derived from a network meta-analysis of 44 trials of oral OAB treatments. Therapy beginning with an oral OAB agent could discontinue or switch to another oral agent and could be followed by tibial nerve stimulation, sacral neuromodulation, or onabotulinumtoxinA. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Utilities were mapped from incontinence and micturition frequencies as well as demographics. Based on analysis of data from a large healthcare system, elevated ACB was associated with increased healthcare utilization and probability of cognitive impairment. RESULTS: From both commercial and Medicare Advantage perspectives, mirabegron was the most clinically effective treatment, while oxybutynin was the least expensive. Tolterodine immediate release (IR) was also on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The analysis estimated costs per QALY of $59,690 and $66,347 for mirabegron from commercial health plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives, respectively, compared to tolterodine IR.

Therapy beginning with an oral OAB agent could discontinue or switch to another oral agent and could be followed by tibial nerve stimulation, sacral neuromodulation, or onabotulinumtoxinA. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Utilities were mapped from incontinence and micturition frequencies as well as demographics. Based on analysis of data from a large healthcare system, elevated ACB was associated with increased healthcare utilization and probability of cognitive impairment. RESULTS: From both commercial and Medicare Advantage perspectives, mirabegron was the most clinically effective treatment, while oxybutynin was the least expensive. Tolterodine immediate release (IR) was also on the cost-effectiveness frontier. The analysis estimated costs per QALY of $59,690 and $66,347 for mirabegron from commercial health plan and Medicare Advantage perspectives, respectively, compared to tolterodine IR.

METHODS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of GClb versus other chemoimmunotherapy options. The model comprised three mutually exclusive health states: ""progression-free survival (with/without therapy)"", ""progression (refractory/relapsed lines)"", and ""death"". Each state was assigned a health utility value representing patients'' quality of life and a specific cost value. Comparisons between GClb and rituximab plus chlorambucil or only chlorambucil were performed using patient-level clinical trial data; other comparisons were performed via a network meta-analysis using information gathered in a systematic literature review. To support the model, a utility elicitation study was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. RESULTS: There was good agreement between the model-predicted progression-free and overall survival and that from the CLL11 trial. On incorporating data from the indirect treatment comparisons, it was found that GClb was cost-effective with a range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below a threshold of pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and remained so during deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses under various scenarios.

16582,Economic and Public Health Impacts of Policies Restricting Access to Hepatitis C Treatment for Medicaid Patients,"BACKGROUND: Interferon-free hepatitis C treatment regimens are effective but very costly. The cost-effectiveness, budget, and public health impacts of current Medicaid treatment policies restricting treatment to patients with advanced disease remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of current Medicaid policies restricting hepatitis C treatment to patients with advanced disease compared with a strategy providing unrestricted access to hepatitis C treatment, assess the budget and public health impact of each strategy, and estimate the feasibility and long-term effects of increased access to treatment for patients with hepatitis C. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we compared two strategies for 45- to 55-year-old Medicaid beneficiaries: 1) Current Practice-only advanced disease is treated before Medicare eligibility and 2) Full Access-both early-stage and advanced disease are treated before Medicare eligibility. Patients could develop progressive fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma, undergo transplantation, or die each year. Morbidity was reduced after successful treatment. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and compared the costs and public health effects of each strategy from the perspective of Medicare alone as well as the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services perspective. We varied model inputs in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Full Access was less costly and more effective than Current Practice for all cohorts and perspectives, with differences in cost ranging from $5,369 to $11,960 and in effectiveness from 0.82 to 3.01 quality-adjusted life-years. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Full Access was cost saving in 93% of model iterations. Compared with Current Practice, Full Access averted 5,994 hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 121 liver transplants per 100,000 patients.

16585,Adrenal vein sampling versus CT scan to determine treatment in primary aldosteronism: an outcome-based randomised diagnostic trial,"BACKGROUND: The distinction between unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia as causes of primary aldosteronism is usually made by adrenal CT or by adrenal vein sampling (AVS). Whether CT or AVS represents the best test for diagnosis remains unknown. We aimed to compare the outcome of CT-based management with AVS-based management for patients with primary aldosteronism. METHODS: In a randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned patients with aldosteronism to undergo either adrenal CT or AVS to determine the presence of aldosterone-producing adenoma (with subsequent treatment consisting of adrenalectomy) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (subsequent treatment with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists). The primary endpoint was the intensity of drug treatment for obtaining target blood pressure after 1 year of follow-up, in the intention-to-diagnose population. Intensity of drug treatment was expressed as daily defined doses. Key secondary endpoints included biochemical outcome in patients who received adrenalectomy, health-related quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01096654. FINDINGS: We recruited 200 patients between July 6, 2010, and May 30, 2013. Of the 184 patients that completed follow-up, 92 received CT-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) and 92 received AVS-based treatment (46 adrenalectomy and 46 mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist). We found no differences in the intensity of antihypertensive medication required to control blood pressure between patients with CT-based treatment and those with AVS-based treatment (median daily defined doses 3.0 [IQR 1.0-5.0] vs 3.0 [1.1-5.9], p=0.52; median number of drugs 2 [IQR 1-3] vs 2 [1-3], p=0.87). Target blood pressure was reached in 39 (42%) patients and 41 (45%) patients, respectively (p=0.82). On secondary endpoints we found no differences in health-related quality of life (median RAND-36 physical scores 52.7 [IQR 43.9-56.8] vs 53.2 [44.0-56.8], p=0.83; RAND-36 mental scores 49.8 [43.1-54.6] vs 52.7 [44.9-55.5], p=0.17) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment. Biochemically, 37 (80%) of patients with CT-based adrenalectomy and 41 (89%) of those with AVS-based adrenalectomy had resolved hyperaldosteronism (p=0.25). A non-significant mean difference of 0.05 (95% CI -0.04 to 0.13) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was found to the advantage of the AVS group, associated with a significant increase in mean health-care costs of euro2285 per patient (95% CI 1323-3248). At a willingness-to-pay value of euro30 000 per QALY, the probability that AVS compared with CT constitutes an efficient use of health-care resources in the diagnostic work-up of patients with primary aldosteronism is less than 0.2. There was no difference in adverse events between groups (159 events of which nine were serious vs 187 events of which 12 were serious) for CT-based and AVS-based treatment. INTERPRETATION: Treatment of primary aldosteronism based on CT or AVS did not show significant differences in intensity of antihypertensive medication or clinical benefits for patients after 1 year of follow-up. This finding challenges the current recommendation to perform AVS in all patients with primary aldosteronism.

16586,Hydroxyethyl starch versus saline for resuscitation of patients in intensive care: long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis of a cohort from CHEST,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxyethyl starch for fluid resuscitation in critically ill patients is not associated with improved short-term patient-centred outcomes compared with crystalloid fluid solutions. However, its effect on longer term health economic outcomes has not been reported. METHODS: We did a prespecified cost-effectiveness analysis of a cohort of patients from New South Wales enrolled in the Crystalloid versus Hydroxyethyl Starch Trial (CHEST), who were randomised to treatment with either 6% hydroxyethyl starch with a molecular weight of 130 kD and a molar substitution ratio of 0.4 or 0.9% sodium chloride (saline) for fluid resuscitation. Clinical outcomes were mortality and life-years gained at 6 months and 24 months, health-related quality of life at 6 months, and quality-adjusted life-years gained at 6 months. Health economic outcomes were hospital and intensive-care unit (ICU) resource use and costs at 24 months and cost-effectiveness, which we defined as the probability of reaching a willingness-to-pay threshold of less than A$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained at 6 months and $100 000 per life-year gained at 24 months. CHEST is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00935168. FINDINGS: 3537 (51%) of 7000 patients were enrolled into CHEST from New South Wales, of whom 3450 (98%) were included in our cost-effectiveness analysis. Mortality at both 6 months and 24 months did not differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 months: 397/1684 [24%] vs 382/1706 [22%]; relative risk [RR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.93-1.19; p=0.41; 24 months: 586/1687 [35%] vs 594/1708 [35%]; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91-1.10; p=0.89). The mean number of life-years gained at 6 months and 24 months was similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (6 months: 0.41 days [SD 0.18] vs 0.41 days [0.17]; p=0.25; 24 months: 1.46 years [SD 0.80] vs 1.47 years [0.79]; p=0.72). At 6 months, the mean health-related quality of life score was 0.67 (SD 0.34) with hydroxyethyl starch versus 0.69 (0.35) with saline (p=0.33). The mean number of quality-adjusted life-years gained did not differ between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups at 6 months (0.26 days [SD 0.18] vs 0.26 days [0.18]; p=0.33). Total hospital costs (including ICU costs) at 24 months were similar between the hydroxyethyl starch and saline groups (A$62 196 [55 935] vs $62 617 [56 452]; p=0.83). The probability that hydroxyethyl starch was cost effective was 11% at 6 months and 29% at 24 months. INTERPRETATION: Although longer term clinical outcomes did not differ between patients resuscitated with hydroxyethyl starch or saline in the ICU, from a health-care payer''s perspective, the probability that hydroxyethyl starch is cost effective in these patients is low.

METHODS: uPA/PAI-1 testing was compared to chemotherapy for all patients and to no chemotherapy in two age-related subgroups (35-49 and 50-75 years). A partitioned survival analysis was performed using patient-level data for survival outcomes and secondary sources. Mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were estimated over a lifetime horizon to calculate the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) at a willingness-to-pay of euro50,000/QALY. Uncertainty was explored through bootstrap and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 5000 replicates. RESULTS: In the 35-49 year age group, INMBs were negative when uPA/PAI-1 testing was compared to chemotherapy for all patients but positive when it was compared to no chemotherapy for the three countries. In the 50-75 year age group, INMBs of uPA/PAI-1 testing compared to both reference strategies were positive in the three countries, with cost-effectiveness probabilities for the uPA/PAI-1 strategy of 65%, 70%, and 59% for France, Germany, and the Netherlands, respectively, compared with chemotherapy for all patients, and 64%, 58%, and 65%, respectively, compared with no chemotherapy.

RESULTS: In the 35-49 year age group, INMBs were negative when uPA/PAI-1 testing was compared to chemotherapy for all patients but positive when it was compared to no chemotherapy for the three countries. In the 50-75 year age group, INMBs of uPA/PAI-1 testing compared to both reference strategies were positive in the three countries, with cost-effectiveness probabilities for the uPA/PAI-1 strategy of 65%, 70%, and 59% for France, Germany, and the Netherlands, respectively, compared with chemotherapy for all patients, and 64%, 58%, and 65%, respectively, compared with no chemotherapy.

16599,Cost-Effectiveness of Increasing Influenza Vaccination Coverage in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes in Turkey,"OBJECTIVE: In Turkey, the prevalence of diabetes is high but the influenza vaccination coverage rate (VCR) is low (9.1% in 2014), despite vaccination being recommended and reimbursed. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of increasing the influenza VCR of adults with type 2 diabetes in Turkey to 20%. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was adapted to Turkey using data derived from published sources. Direct medical costs and indirect costs due to productivity loss were included in the societal perspective. The time horizon was set at 1 year to reflect the seasonality of influenza. RESULTS: Increasing the VCR for adults with type 2 diabetes to 20% is predicted to avert an additional 19,777 influenza cases, 2376 hospitalizations, and 236 deaths. Associated influenza costs avoided were estimated at more than 8.3 million Turkish Lira (TRY), while the cost of vaccination would be more than TRY 8.4 million. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at TRY 64/quality-adjusted life years, which is below the per capita gross domestic product of TRY 21,511 and therefore very cost-effective according to World Health Organization guidelines. Factors most influencing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were the excess hospitalization rate, inpatient cost, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization, and influenza attack rate. Increasing the VCR to >20% was also estimated to be very cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the VCR for adults with type 2 diabetes in Turkey to >/=20% would be very cost-effective.",2016-01-22727,27322384,PLoS One,Levent Akin,2016,11 / 6,e0157657,No,27322384,"Levent Akin; Berengere Macabeo; Zafer Caliskan; Serdar Altinel; Ilhan Satman; Cost-Effectiveness of Increasing Influenza Vaccination Coverage in Adults with Type 2 Diabetes in Turkey, PLoS One , 2016; 11(6):1932-6203; e0157657",QALY,Turkey,Not Stated,Not Stated,Increasing the influenza vaccination coverage rate (VCR) for adults with type 2 diabetes to 20% vs. Standard/Usual Care- Vaccine coverage rate at 9.1%,Not Stated,Not Stated,8 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,3.00,64,Turkish Lira,2014,32
