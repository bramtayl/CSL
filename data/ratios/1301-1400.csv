1301,Decision framework for chemotherapeutic interventions for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Best supportive care has long been considered to be the standard therapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There is now evidence from randomized trials that a number of chemotherapy regimens can palliate cancer-related symptoms and modestly improve survival. We show how cost-effectiveness analyses can be used to make choices between different (ambulatory) chemotherapy regimens. METHODS: Clinical algorithms describing the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of metastatic NSCLC were incorporated into Statistics Canada's Population Health Model. Using consistent methodology, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of several chemotherapeutic interventions: a combination of vindesine (VDS) plus cisplatin, etoposide (VP-16) plus cisplatin, vinblastine (VLB) plus cisplatin, vinorelbine (Navelbine; NVB) plus cisplatin, paclitaxel (Taxol) plus cisplatin, and gemcitabine (GEM) and NVB alone. We calculated the total chemotherapy costs in 1995 Canadian dollars, the cost per case, the average life-years saved, and the cost per life-year saved. Using the Population Health Model, we then constructed an advanced decision framework that rank-ordered the various treatment regimens so as to optimize benefit below various cost-effectiveness thresholds. RESULTS: One regimen (VLB plus cisplatin) appears to result in better survival and lower health care expenditures than best supportive care. By use of cost-effectiveness thresholds of $25,000 and $50,000 per life-year gained, NVB plus cisplatin is the preferred regimen. When quality of life is considered, however, GEM is preferred to NVB plus cisplatin at a threshold value of $50,000. At thresholds of $75 000 and $100,000, paclitaxel plus cisplatin at a dose of 135 mg/m(2) is the preferred regimen. At thresholds of $50,000 and above, best supportive care is the least preferred regimen. CONCLUSIONS: This decision framework allows the comparison of different treatment regimens based on various cost-effectiveness thresholds. Our analysis also supports the use of chemotherapy regimens and the abandonment of best supportive care as the standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC.

1302,Treatment of multiple sclerosis with interferon beta: an appraisal of cost-effectiveness and quality of life,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interferon beta-1b (IFbeta-1b) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). METHODS: Construction of a cost-effectiveness model using published data on IFbeta-1b effectiveness and the natural history of RRMS, and new data on costs and quality of life (QoL) from a sample of 102 patients with RRMS and resident in northern England. RESULTS: Poorer QoL was found for patients with multiple sclerosis compared with the general population; those who had had a relapse; those with worse states identified by a clinical measure (expanded disability status scale (EDSS)). Relapses have effects over several months. Health state valuations were higher than in the general population. Costs were higher in relapse than remission and for worse EDSS states. IFbeta-1b costs were larger than cost savings. The best cost-effectiveness estimate was pound28 700 per relapse avoided, which is pound809 900 per QALY gained; or pound328 300 per QALY gained allowing for effects of progression over 5 years. Estimates were robust to changes in assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of multiple sclerosis on QoL is substantial.

1305,The cost-effectiveness of different management strategies for patients on chronic warfarin therapy,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of moving from usual care to more organized management strategies for patients on chronic warfarin therapy. DESIGN: Using information available in the scientific literature, supplemented with data from a large health system and, when necessary, expert opinion, we constructed a 5-year Markov model to evaluate the health and economic outcomes associated with each of three different anticoagulation management approaches: usual care, anticoagulation clinic testing with a capillary monitor, and patient self-testing with a capillary monitor. PATIENTS: Three hypothetical cohorts of patients beginning long-term warfarin therapy were used to generate model results. MAIN RESULTS: Model results indicated that moving from usual care to anticoagulation clinic testing would result in a total of 1.7 thromboembolic events and 2.0 hemorrhagic events avoided per 100 patients over 5 years. Another 4.0 thromboembolic events and 0.8 hemorrhagic events would be avoided by moving to patient self-testing. When direct medical care costs and those incurred by patients and their caregivers in receiving care were considered, patient self-testing was the most cost-effective alternative, resulting in an overall cost saving.

1307,Power Doppler imaging: initial evaluation as a screening examination for carotid artery stenosis,"PURPOSE: To evaluate power Doppler imaging as a possible screening examination for carotid artery stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the principal pilot study, a prospective, blinded comparison of power Doppler imaging with duplex Doppler imaging, the reference-standard method, was conducted in 100 consecutive patients routinely referred for carotid artery imaging at a large, private multispecialty clinic. In the validation pilot study, a prospective, blinded comparison of power Doppler imaging with digital subtraction angiography, the reference-standard method, was conducted in 20 consecutive patients routinely referred at a teaching hospital. Using conservative assumptions, the authors performed cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Power Doppler imaging produced diagnostic-quality images in 89% of patients. When the images of the patients with nondiagnostic examinations were regarded as positive, power Doppler imaging had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, A(z), of 0.87, sensitivity of 70%, and specificity of 91%. The validation study results were very similar. The cost-effectiveness of screening and, as indicated, duplex Doppler imaging as the definitive diagnostic examination and endarterectomy was $47,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSION: The A(z) value for power Doppler imaging compares well with that for mammography, a generally accepted screening examination, and with most other imaging examinations.

METHODS: A clinical decision model was constructed to estimate 18-month costs and outcomes associated with these treatment scenarios based on the medical literature and clinician judgment. The clinical parameters and outcomes for the model were derived from a series of systematic clinical trials with imipramine utilising uniform dosage procedures and validated response criteria. Costs were calculated based on standardised treatment regimens. The outcome measures were 18-month medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs per QALY gained. A sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the impact of treatment withdrawals on outcomes. STUDY PERSPECTIVE: US mental healthcare system. RESULTS: Over 18 months, the total costs (1997 values) and QALYs associated with half-dose maintenance therapy (imipramine 1.1 mg/kg/day) [$US3377; QALYs = 0.991] and full-dose maintenance therapy (imipramine 2.25 mg/kg/ day) [$US3361; QALYs = 0.991] were almost identical; both were cost saving compared with acute imipramine therapy (2.25 mg/kg/day) with no maintenance treatment ($US3691; QALYs = 0.979). Whether patients withdrawing from treatment were considered to have continued to respond to treatment or to have relapsed, the half-dose and full-dose maintenance treatments were still cost saving compared with acute treatment alone.

1318,Cost effectiveness of human immunodeficiency virus postexposure prophylaxis for healthcare workers,"OBJECTIVE: The United States Public Health Service (USPHS) published recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) of healthcare workers in May 1998. The aim of this study was to analyse the cost effectiveness of the USPHS PEP guidelines. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a modelling study in the setting of the US healthcare system in 1989. The analysis was performed from the societal perspective; however, only HIV healthcare costs were considered and health-related losses of productivity were not included. METHODS: A decision tree incorporating a Markov model was created for 4 PEP strategies: the current USPHS recommendations, triple drug therapy, zidovudine monotherapy or no prophylaxis. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation was performed. Confidence intervals (CIs) around cost-effectiveness estimates were estimated by a bootstrapping method. RESULTS: The costs (in 1997 US dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) save by each strategy were as follows: monotherapy $US688 (95% CI: $US624 to $US750); USPHS recommendations $US5211 (95% CI: $US5126 to $US5293); and triple drug therapy $US8827 (95% CI: $US8715 to $US8940). The marginal cost per year of life saved was: USPHS recommendations $US81 987 (95% CI: $US80 437 to $US83 689); triple drug therapy $US970 451 (95% CI: $US924 786 to $US 1 014 429). Sensitivity testing showed that estimates of the probability of seroconversion for each category of exposure were most influential, but did not change the order of strategies in the baseline analysis. With the prolonged HIV stage durations and increased costs associated with recent innovations in HIV therapy, the marginal cost effectiveness of the USPHS PEP strategy was decreased to $US62 497/QALY saved. All 3 intervention strategies were cost effective compared with no postexposure prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Current USPHS PEP recommendations are marginally cost effective compared with monotherapy, but the additional efficacy of triple drug therapy for all risk categories is rewarded by only a small reduction in HIV infections at great expense.

1338,Extended anticoagulation for prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism in carriers of factor V Leiden--cost-effectiveness analysis,"There is much debate over the appropriateness of prescribing prolonged anticoagulation to heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden suffering a first episode of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). We, thus used meta-analysis to estimate from six eligible studies the summary odds-ratio of recurrent DVT in carriers of factor V Leiden versus non-carriers: 1.36 (CI, 1.05-1.78). After that, we used a decision model to compare lifelong costs and benefits of 6 months standard anticoagulation with those of screening for carriers of factor V Leiden and extending for 2 years their anticoagulation. Screening was a cost-effective strategy, since it provided 2 additional quality-adjusted days of life per patient at the cost of $12,833 per quality-adjusted year of life saved, as compared to standard management. However, screening was not cost-effective in patients who were predicted to incur fatal bleeding at a rate higher than 0.34% per year or recurrent DVT at a rate lower than 9% in the first 2 years. The screening policy was cost-saving if restricted to patients with idiopathic DVT and compliant to warfarin therapy.",2000-01-02167,11127850,Thromb Haemost,M Marchetti,2000,84 / 5,752-7,No,11127850,"M Marchetti; A Pistorio; G Barosi; Extended anticoagulation for prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism in carriers of factor V Leiden--cost-effectiveness analysis, Thromb Haemost, 2000-Nov; 84(5):0340-6245; 752-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Screening for factor V Leiden, followed by 2 years of treatment with warfarin vs. Standard care",Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,12833,United States,1998,20376.21
1339,The cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical respiratory syncytial virus vaccine in the elderly,"To determine if specific levels of vaccine cost and effectiveness exist that would support eventual respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine use in the elderly, a cost-effectiveness study was conducted comparing yearly administration of a hypothetical RSV vaccine among the 65-year-old US cohort to medical management of disease. Using base case assumptions - including a vaccine effectiveness against RSV-related hospitalization and death of 80% and a vaccine cost of US$33 - vaccine would result in 0.7 additional days of healthy life at a cost of US$9.82 per person. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained equaled US$5342 and remained reasonable over a wide range of vaccine cost and effectiveness.

1340,Prevention with tamoxifen or other hormones versus prophylactic surgery in BRCA1/2-positive women: a decision analysis,"PURPOSE: Recent randomized controlled trials have shown that tamoxifen and raloxifene may prevent invasive breast cancer. This decision analysis study compares the outcomes of chemoprevention with tamoxifen, raloxifene, or oral contraceptives with the outcomes of prophylactic surgery among women with high-risk BRCA1/2 mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a simulated cohort of 30-year-old women who tested positive for BRCA1/2 mutations and constructed a Markov model with Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating cumulative breast and ovarian cancer incidence rates from the literature and survival figures from SEER data. We assumed that prophylactic surgery reduces ovarian cancer risk by 45% and breast cancer risk by 90%, that tamoxifen reduces invasive breast cancer risk by 49%, and that raloxifene has similar efficacy and safety in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We used data obtained from high-risk women by a time trade-off questionnaire to calculate quality-adjusted life-years. We based our cost estimates for hospital and ambulatory care on Health Care Financing Administration payments, the SEER-HCFA database, and the Pharmacy Fundamental Reference. RESULTS: In our model, a 30-year-old BRCA1/2+ woman could prolong survival by 0.9 years (95% probability interval, 0.4-1.2 years) by having bilateral oophorectomy, 3.4 years (2.7-3.7 years) by having bilateral mastectomy, and 4.3 years (3.6-4.6 years) by having both procedures instead of surveillance alone. Chemoprevention with tamoxifen and raloxifene increased survival by 1.6 years (1.0-2.1 years) and 2.2 years (1.3-2.8 years), respectively. Chemoprevention yielded more quality-adjusted life-years than did prophylactic surgery, even when treatment was delayed to age 40 or 50 years. All these procedures were cost-effective or cost-saving compared with surveillance alone. DISCUSSION: Our model suggests that although surgery may yield more substantial survival and cost benefits, quality of life issues may make chemoprevention a more attractive option for young women at high genetic risk.",2000-01-02250,10696733,Cancer J Sci Am,V R Grann,2000,6 / 1,13-20,No,10696733,"V R Grann; J S Jacobson; W Whang; D Hershman; D F Heitjan; K H Antman; A I Neugut; Prevention with tamoxifen or other hormones versus prophylactic surgery in BRCA1/2-positive women: a decision analysis, Cancer J Sci Am, 2000 Jan-Feb; 6(1):1081-4442; 13-20",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Prophylactic surgery (oophorectomy, mastectomy, or both) vs. Surveillance",Not Stated,30 Years,30 Years,Female,Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,1998,Not Stated

1346,Prevention with tamoxifen or other hormones versus prophylactic surgery in BRCA1/2-positive women: a decision analysis,"PURPOSE: Recent randomized controlled trials have shown that tamoxifen and raloxifene may prevent invasive breast cancer. This decision analysis study compares the outcomes of chemoprevention with tamoxifen, raloxifene, or oral contraceptives with the outcomes of prophylactic surgery among women with high-risk BRCA1/2 mutations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a simulated cohort of 30-year-old women who tested positive for BRCA1/2 mutations and constructed a Markov model with Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating cumulative breast and ovarian cancer incidence rates from the literature and survival figures from SEER data. We assumed that prophylactic surgery reduces ovarian cancer risk by 45% and breast cancer risk by 90%, that tamoxifen reduces invasive breast cancer risk by 49%, and that raloxifene has similar efficacy and safety in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We used data obtained from high-risk women by a time trade-off questionnaire to calculate quality-adjusted life-years. We based our cost estimates for hospital and ambulatory care on Health Care Financing Administration payments, the SEER-HCFA database, and the Pharmacy Fundamental Reference. RESULTS: In our model, a 30-year-old BRCA1/2+ woman could prolong survival by 0.9 years (95% probability interval, 0.4-1.2 years) by having bilateral oophorectomy, 3.4 years (2.7-3.7 years) by having bilateral mastectomy, and 4.3 years (3.6-4.6 years) by having both procedures instead of surveillance alone.

1352,Cost-effectiveness analysis of lamivudine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the short term and long term cost effectiveness, from a healthcare perspective, associated with the introduction of lamivudine for chronic hepatitis B. DESIGN: The analysis used a 2-step modelling approach. A decision tree was used to estimate clinical outcomes and costs after 1 year. The 1-year results were then extrapolated to 70 years using a Markov model. PATIENTS: The study population comprised hypothetical cohorts of patients with chronic hepatitis B, representative of those likely to receive treatment in clinical practice in Australia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: In the short term, more patients sero-converted when lamivudine was available, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 3341 Australian dollars ($A) per additional seroconversion. In the long term, the introduction of lamivudine increased life expectancy by 3.9 years [3.2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)] compared with when interferon-alpha was the only treatment, or 4.6 years (3.8 QALYs) compared with no treatment. There were reductions in lifetime risk of developing compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma of 5, 11 and 11%, respectively, when lamivudine was available. The incremental cost of having lamivudine available, as opposed to interferon-alpha only, was $A633 per year of life saved or $A735 per QALY. CONCLUSION: The introduction of lamivudine is expected to reduce and delay the progression of chronic hepatitis B, increasing the life expectancy and quality of life of patients for a small overall increase in healthcare costs.",2000-01-02251,10977384,Pharmacoeconomics,S J Crowley,2000,17 / 5,409-27,Yes,10977384,"S J Crowley; D Tognarini; P V Desmond; M Lees; Cost-effectiveness analysis of lamivudine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, Pharmacoeconomics, 2000-May; 17(5):1179-2027; 409-27",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lamivudine vs. Interferon alpha,Not Stated,30 Years,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,735,Australia,1997,881.42
1354,Health economics of a hexavalent meningococcal outer-membrane vesicle vaccine in children: potential impact of introduction in the Dutch vaccination program,"The cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination of infants with a new hexavalent meningococcal B outer-membrane vesicle vaccine is projected for The Netherlands by applying decision analysis. The societal perspective is taken and direct and productivity costs (friction costs method) are considered. Future costs and effects are discounted at 4% (base year 1998).In this simulation model, vaccination would prevent 19 deaths and eight cases with severe long-term sequelae per year, rendering 526 additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs) per year. Yearly costs of acute phase of illness due to meningococcal infections in children are estimated at 1,426,634, while the future costs due to sequelae are estimated at 3,801,121 per year. Of all these costs, the vaccination program could prevent 3,334,052 per year. The program costs of meningococcal vaccination are estimated at 11,601,356, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) of 15,721 per QALY.

1355,A cost-effectiveness model of tibolone as treatment for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women in Sweden,"Background: Osteoporosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly and, in particular, among postmenopausal women. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been shown to protect against fractures, as well as to alleviate climacteric symptoms related to menopause. Unfortunately, HRT has a number of adverse effects and many patients are noncompliant. Tibolone, a synthetic steroid with tissue-specific estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic effects, has been shown to prevent the loss of bone mass as well as to relieve climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women, with fewer accompanying adverse effects. Objective: To estimate the economic impact in Sweden of administering tibolone 2.5 mg/day to postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis-related bone fractures relative to a policy of no intervention. Design and Setting: Modelling study performed from the national health system perspective in Sweden. Methodology: Disease modelling was used to simulate the risks of osteoporosis-related hip, vertebral and forearm fractures over time in hypothetical cohorts of postmenopausal women. The occurrence of fractures was predicted using risk functions estimated with data from actual cohorts of women in Sweden as well as the USA. Sweden-specific cost data were then used to estimate the economic impact with cost-effectiveness tools. Results: The model predicts that 22% of hip fractures and 13% of combined hip, vertebral and forearm fractures can be avoided over a 25-year time-period by administering tibolone to osteoporotic women. Depending on the severity of loss in bone mass and the values assumed for key parameters, estimates of the cost effectiveness of treatment range from cost saving to incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of around SEK200 000. Delaying treatment to late menopause tends to decrease cost effectiveness.

Tibolone, a synthetic steroid with tissue-specific estrogenic, progestogenic and androgenic effects, has been shown to prevent the loss of bone mass as well as to relieve climacteric symptoms in postmenopausal women, with fewer accompanying adverse effects. Objective: To estimate the economic impact in Sweden of administering tibolone 2.5 mg/day to postmenopausal women at risk for osteoporosis-related bone fractures relative to a policy of no intervention. Design and Setting: Modelling study performed from the national health system perspective in Sweden. Methodology: Disease modelling was used to simulate the risks of osteoporosis-related hip, vertebral and forearm fractures over time in hypothetical cohorts of postmenopausal women. The occurrence of fractures was predicted using risk functions estimated with data from actual cohorts of women in Sweden as well as the USA. Sweden-specific cost data were then used to estimate the economic impact with cost-effectiveness tools. Results: The model predicts that 22% of hip fractures and 13% of combined hip, vertebral and forearm fractures can be avoided over a 25-year time-period by administering tibolone to osteoporotic women. Depending on the severity of loss in bone mass and the values assumed for key parameters, estimates of the cost effectiveness of treatment range from cost saving to incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of around SEK200 000. Delaying treatment to late menopause tends to decrease cost effectiveness. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that, relative to no treatment, tibolone is a cost-effective treatment in Sweden for the prevention of fractures in women with low bone mass, especially when treatment is initiated around the onset of menopause and is administered for 5 years.",2001-01-02020,8,Clin Drug Investig,Michael S Willis,2001,21 / 2,115-127,Yes,8,"Michael S Willis; A cost-effectiveness model of tibolone as treatment for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women in Sweden, Clin Drug Investig, 2001; 21(2):1173-2563; 115-127",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tibolone 2.5 mg/day vs. No intervention,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Female,Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,93074,Sweden,1998,18590.17
1359,Cost-effectiveness of a brief video-based HIV intervention for African American and Latino sexually transmitted disease clinic clients,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Decisions about the dissemination of HIV interventions need to be informed by evidence of their cost-effectiveness in reducing negative health outcomes. Having previously shown the effectiveness of a single-session video-based group intervention (VOICES/VOCES) in reducing incidence of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) among male African American and Latino clients attending an urban STD clinic, this study estimates its cost-effectiveness in terms of disease averted. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was calculated using data on effectiveness from a randomized clinical trial of the VOICES/VOCES intervention along with updated data on the costs of intervention from four replication sites. STD incidence and self-reported behavioral data were used to make estimates of reduction in HIV incidence among study participants. RESULTS: The average annual cost to provide the intervention to 10 000 STD clinic clients was estimated to be US$447 005, with a cost per client of US$43.30. This expenditure would result in an average of 27.69 HIV infections averted, with an average savings from averted medical costs of US$5 544 408. The number of quality adjusted life years saved averaged 387.61, with a cost per HIV infection averted of US$21 486. CONCLUSIONS: This brief behavioral intervention was found to be feasible and cost-saving when targeted to male STD clinic clients at high risk of contracting and transmitting infections, indicating that this strategy should be considered for inclusion in HIV prevention programming.",2001-01-02169,11371693,AIDS,M Sweat,2001,15 / 6,781-7,No,11371693,"M Sweat; C O'Donnell; L O'Donnell; Cost-effectiveness of a brief video-based HIV intervention for African American and Latino sexually transmitted disease clinic clients, AIDS, 2001-Apr-13; 15(6):0269-9370; 781-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Single session video-based group intervention vs. No video,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-1421.19,United States,1999,-2207.8
1360,The cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance therapy for opiate addiction in the United States,"AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance therapy for opiate addiction in the United States, particularly its effect on the HIV epidemic. DESIGN: We developed a dynamic model to capture the effects of adding buprenorphine maintenance to the current opiate dependence treatment system. We evaluated incremental costs, including all health-care costs, and incremental effectiveness, measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of survival. We considered communities with HIV prevalence among injection drug users of 5% and 40%. Because no price has been set in the United States for a dose of buprenorphine, we considered three prices per dose: $5, $15, and $30. FINDINGS: If buprenorphine increases the number of individuals in maintenance treatment by 10%, but does not affect the number of individuals receiving methadone maintenance, the cost-effectiveness ratios for buprenorphine maintenance therapy are less than $45 000 per QALY gained for all prices, in both the low-prevalence and high-prevalence communities. If the same number of individuals enter buprenorphine maintenance (10% of the number currently in methadone), but half are injection drug users newly entering maintenance and half are individuals who switched from methadone to buprenorphine, the cost-effectiveness ratios in both communities are less than $45 000 per QALY gained for the $5 and $15 prices, and greater than $65 000 per QALY gained for the $30 price. CONCLUSIONS: At a price of $5 or less per dose, buprenorphine maintenance is cost-effective under all scenarios we considered. At $15 per dose, it is cost-effective if its adoption does not lead to a net decline in methadone use, or if a medium to high value is assigned to the years of life lived by injection drug users and those in maintenance therapy.

1362,Comparison of four strategies for diagnosing deep vein thrombosis: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: Four strategies for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis have been validated recently. The strategies use various combinations of assessment of a patient's clinical probability of having deep venous thrombosis, serial lower limb venous compression ultrasonography, and measurement of plasma D-dimer levels. We compared the cost-effectiveness of these diagnostic strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a formal cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-analysis model. Outcomes considered were costs per patient, 3-month quality-adjusted survival, number of lives saved per 1,000 patients, and incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Under baseline conditions, with a 24% prevalence of deep vein thrombosis in tested patients, the effectiveness of all strategies was similar (4.6 to 4.8 lives saved per 1,000 patients managed). The most expensive strategy was serial ultrasound (repeat ultrasound on day 7 in all patients with a normal initial ultrasound) at a cost-effectiveness of $10,716 per additional QALY. Performing a repeat ultrasound only in patients with an elevated D-dimer level (serial ultrasound with D-dimer) was somewhat less expensive at $10,281 per additional QALY. Taking clinical probability into account by repeating ultrasound only in patients with an intermediate clinical probability of deep vein thrombosis (risk-based serial ultrasound) yielded further savings and cost $10,090 per additional QALY. The least expensive and most cost-effective option was to perform D-dimer as the initial test, followed by a single ultrasound if the D-dimer level was abnormal, and by phlebography in patients with a normal ultrasound and a high clinical probability of deep vein thrombosis (D-dimer with risk-based single ultrasound) at $8,897 per additional QALY. This strategy allowed a 17% reduction in incremental costs compared with the most expensive algorithm and reduced resource consumption (70 ultrasound procedures per 100 patients managed vs 130 to 170 with the other diagnostic strategies). CONCLUSIONS: Combining clinical probability and D-dimer with a single ultrasound in the diagnostic workup of patients with possible deep vein thrombosis is highly cost-effective, allowing a reduction in costs and resource use without any substantial increase in mortality.

1364,Low-molecular-weight heparin versus warfarin for secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To compare the cost effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin with that of oral anticoagulants in preventing recurrences after an episode of venous thromboembolism. METHODS: A decision tree was used to assess the cost and the expected quality-adjusted years of life (QALY) after treatment with either low-molecular-weight heparin or warfarin, based on pooled data from six published trials. Preferences were elicited with a modified time trade-off method in a sample of patients attending an anticoagulation clinic. RESULTS: Compared with warfarin, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly decreased the rate of minor bleeding (odds ratio [OR] = 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14 to 0.43) but not recurrent deep vein thromboses (OR = 0.77; 95% CI: 0.43 to 1.35). Patients' preference for warfarin (0.988, on a 0 to 1 scale) was lower than that for low-molecular-weight heparin (0.992), but the difference was not statistically significant. A Monte Carlo analysis estimated that low-molecular-weight heparin saved an average of 13 quality-adjusted days compared with warfarin, at a cost of $6,583 per QALY (95% CI: $5,525 to $7,625) based on costs in Italy and $28,231 per QALY (95% CI: $20,872 to $36,773) based on costs in the United States. When we included rebound recurrences after interruption of therapy, which were more common with low-molecular-weight heparin, treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin cost $53,166 per QALY in Italy and $177,166 per QALY in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: Low-molecular-weight heparin might be a cost-effective drug for secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism, especially in patients at high risk of recurrence and where the drug's cost is lower. The apparent increase in recurrence after interruption of therapy needs to be investigated more thoroughly before low-molecular-weight heparin can be recommended routinely.",2001-01-02172,11498067,Am J Med,M Marchetti,2001,111 / 2,130-9,No,11498067,"M Marchetti; A Pistorio; M Barone; S Serafini; G Barosi; Low-molecular-weight heparin versus warfarin for secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Am J Med, 2001-Aug; 111(2):0002-9343; 130-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Low molecular weight heparin vs. Warfarin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,28231,United States,1999,43856.5

1369,The cost effectiveness of early treatment with fluticasone propionate 250 microg twice a day in subjects with obstructive airway disease. Results of the DIMCA program,"In a two-stage detection program, subjects with signs of obstructive airway disease were selected from a random sample of the general population. Subjects (n = 82) were randomly assigned to either fluticasone propionate 250 microg twice a day or placebo twice a day via pMDI in a 1-yr, double-blind trial if they met criteria for persistent airway obstruction, increased bronchial hyperresponsiveness, or a rapid decline in FEV(1). Main outcome measures were postbronchodilator FEV(1), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and direct medical cost. Secondary measures were prebronchodilator FEV(1), PC(20), health-related quality of life (CRQ), symptom-free weeks, episode-free weeks, exacerbations, and indirect cost. Subgroup analysis was based on reversibility of obstruction. Analysis revealed a significant gain in postbronchodilator FEV(1) (98 ml/yr; p = 0.01) in favor of fluticasone. Only subjects with reversible obstruction showed an improvement in PC(20) (1.4 doubling dose; p = 0.03). Early treatment resulted in 2.7 QALYs gained per 100 treated subjects (p = 0.17) and in a clinically relevant improvement in dyspnea (CRQ; p < 0.03). The incremental cost effectiveness ratios were US$13,016/QALY for early treatment and US$33,921/QALY for the combination of detection and treatment. The incremental cost for one additional subject with a clinically relevant difference in dyspnea was US$1,674.

1370,Use of genotypic resistance testing to guide hiv therapy: clinical impact and cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Genotypic sequencing for drug-resistant strains of HIV can guide the choice of antiretroviral therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of genotypic resistance testing for patients acquiring drug resistance through failed treatment (secondary resistance) and those infected with resistant virus (primary resistance). DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis with an HIV simulation model incorporating CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level as predictors of disease progression. DATA SOURCES: Published randomized trials and data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, the national AIDS Cost and Services Utilization Survey, the Red Book, and an institutional cost-accounting system. TARGET POPULATION: HIV-infected patients in the United States with baseline CD4 counts of 0.250 x 10(9) cells/L. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Genotypic resistance testing and clinical judgment, compared with clinical judgment alone, in two contexts: after initial treatment failure (secondary resistance testing) and before initiation of antiretroviral therapy (primary resistance testing). OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and cost-effectiveness in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Secondary resistance testing increased life expectancy by 3 months, at a cost of $17 900 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness of primary resistance testing was $22 300 per QALY gained with a 20% prevalence of primary resistance but increased to $69 000 per QALY gained with 4% prevalence.

1371,Use of genotypic resistance testing to guide hiv therapy: clinical impact and cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Genotypic sequencing for drug-resistant strains of HIV can guide the choice of antiretroviral therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of genotypic resistance testing for patients acquiring drug resistance through failed treatment (secondary resistance) and those infected with resistant virus (primary resistance). DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis with an HIV simulation model incorporating CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level as predictors of disease progression. DATA SOURCES: Published randomized trials and data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, the national AIDS Cost and Services Utilization Survey, the Red Book, and an institutional cost-accounting system. TARGET POPULATION: HIV-infected patients in the United States with baseline CD4 counts of 0.250 x 10(9) cells/L. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Genotypic resistance testing and clinical judgment, compared with clinical judgment alone, in two contexts: after initial treatment failure (secondary resistance testing) and before initiation of antiretroviral therapy (primary resistance testing). OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and cost-effectiveness in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Secondary resistance testing increased life expectancy by 3 months, at a cost of $17 900 per QALY gained.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy necessary to make prophylactic ICD or amiodarone therapy cost-effective in patients with myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Markov model-based cost utility analysis. DATA SOURCES: Survival, cardiac death, and inpatient costs were estimated on the basis of the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention registry. Other data were derived from the literature. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with past myocardial infarction who did not have sustained ventricular arrhythmia. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: ICD or amiodarone compared with no treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, number needed to treat, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with no treatment, ICD use led to the greatest QALYs and the highest expenditures. Amiodarone use resulted in intermediate QALYs and costs. To obtain acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds (</=$75,000/QALY), ICDs had to reduce arrhythmic death by 50% and amiodarone had to reduce total death by 7% in patients with depressed ejection fraction. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: For moderate efficacies, in patients with ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.3, 0.31 to 0.4, and greater than 0.4, the cost-effectiveness of amiodarone compared with no therapy was $43,100/QALY, $66,500/QALY, and $132,500/QALY, respectively, and the cost-effectiveness of ICD compared with amiodarone was $71,800/QALY, $195,700/QALY, and $557,900/QALY, respectively.

INTERVENTIONS: ICD or amiodarone compared with no treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, number needed to treat, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with no treatment, ICD use led to the greatest QALYs and the highest expenditures. Amiodarone use resulted in intermediate QALYs and costs. To obtain acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds (</=$75,000/QALY), ICDs had to reduce arrhythmic death by 50% and amiodarone had to reduce total death by 7% in patients with depressed ejection fraction. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: For moderate efficacies, in patients with ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.3, 0.31 to 0.4, and greater than 0.4, the cost-effectiveness of amiodarone compared with no therapy was $43,100/QALY, $66,500/QALY, and $132,500/QALY, respectively, and the cost-effectiveness of ICD compared with amiodarone was $71,800/QALY, $195,700/QALY, and $557,900/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Use of ICD or amiodarone in patients with past myocardial infarction and severely depressed left ventricular function may provide substantial clinical benefit at an acceptable cost.

1382,The cost-utility of screening for depression in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are common in primary care and cause substantial disability, but they often remain undiagnosed. Screening is a frequently proposed strategy for increasing detection of depression. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-utility of screening for depression compared with no screening. DESIGN: Nonstationary Markov model. DATA SOURCES: The published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of 40-year-old primary care patients. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Health care payer and societal. INTERVENTIONS: Self-administered questionnaire followed by provider assessment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with no screening, the cost to society of annual screening for depression in primary care patients is $192 444/QALY. Screening every 5 years and one-time screening cost $50 988/QALY and $32 053/QALY, respectively, compared with no screening. From the payer perspective, the cost of annual screening is $225 467. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Cost-utility ratios are most sensitive to the prevalence of major depression, the costs of screening, rates of treatment initiation, and remission rates with treatment. In Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses, the cost-utility of annual screening is less than $50 000/QALY only 2.2% of the time. In multiway analyses, four model variables must be changed to extreme values for the cost-utility of annual screening to fall below $50 000/QALY, but a change in only one variable increases the cost-utility of one-time screening to more than $50 000/QALY. One-time screening is more robustly cost-effective if screening costs are low and effective treatments are being given.

1385,Antibiotic prophylaxis for haematogenous bacterial arthritis in patients with joint disease: a cost effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for haematogenous bacterial arthritis in patients with joint disease. METHODS: In a decision analysis, data from a prospective study on bacterial arthritis in 4907 patients with joint disease were combined with literature data to assess risks and benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis. Effectiveness and cost effectiveness calculations were performed on antibiotic prophylaxis for various patient groups. Grouping was based on (a) type of event leading to transient bacteraemia-that is, infections (dermal, respiratory/urinary tract) and invasive medical procedures-and (b) the patient's susceptibility to bacterial arthritis which was increased in the presence of rheumatoid arthritis, large joint prostheses, comorbidity, and old age. RESULTS: Of the patients with joint disease, 59% had no characteristics that increased susceptibility to bacterial arthritis, and 31% had one. For dermal infections, the effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis was maximally 35 quality adjusted life days (QALDs) and the cost effectiveness maximally $52 000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). For other infections, the effectiveness of prophylaxis was lower and the cost effectiveness higher. Prophylaxis for invasive medical procedures seemed to be acceptable only in patients with high susceptibility: 1 QALD at a cost of $1300/QALY; however, the results were influenced substantially when the level of efficacy of the prophylaxis or cost of prophylactic antibiotics was changed.

CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis seems to be indicated only for dermal infections, and for infections of the urinary and respiratory tract in patients with increased susceptibility to bacterial arthritis. Prophylaxis for invasive medical procedures, such as dental treatment, may only be indicated for patients with joint disease who are highly susceptible.",2001-01-02179,11247866,Ann Rheum Dis,P Krijnen,2001,60 / 4,359-66,No,11247866,"P Krijnen; C J Kaandorp; E W Steyerberg; D van Schaardenburg; H J Moens; J D Habbema; Antibiotic prophylaxis for haematogenous bacterial arthritis in patients with joint disease: a cost effectiveness analysis, Ann Rheum Dis, 2001-Apr; 60(4):0003-4967; 359-66",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Antibiotic prophylaxis for bacterial arthritis, using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid vs. No prophylaxis",Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,1300,United States,1994,2270.27
1394,A cost--utility analysis comparing second-line chemotherapy schemes in patients with metastatic breast cancer,"A cost-utility analysis has been performed comparing taxanes, vinorelbine and standard therapy for metastatic breast cancer considering clinical efficacy, quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) and costs. A decision model has been built. Clinical efficacy data were collected by literature review. Utility data and cost data were collected from previous studies and Dutch wholesale prices. Except for the MV standard therapy, VM has the lowest C/E ratio of $17,114/QALY, followed by paclitaxel ($30,270/QALY) and docetaxel ($49,739/QALY). VM yields the highest number of QALYs (0.47), compared to paclitaxel (0.35), docetaxel (0.34) and MV (0.29). Compared to the MV standard therapy, the incremental C/E of VM is $23,046/QALY, which is the lowest of all alternatives. We conclude that compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel and MV standard chemotherapy, VM is the most cost-effective second-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer patients. There is a considerable variation in utility scores, depending on the methods or the data sources used.

1397,The cost-effectiveness of vaccination against Lyme disease,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against Lyme disease appears to be safe and effective; however, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with vaccination is unknown. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination compared with no vaccination in individuals living in endemic areas of Lyme disease. Our analysis encompassed a 10-year time horizon including a 2-year vaccination schedule with an additional year of vaccine effectiveness. The costs and probabilities of vaccination risk, compliance and efficacy, and Lyme disease clinical sequelae and treatment were estimated from the literature. Health-related quality-of-life weights of the various clinical sequelae of Lyme disease infection were obtained from a sample of 105 residents from Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. RESULTS: Vaccinating 10 000 residents living in endemic areas with a probability of Lyme disease per season of 0.01 averted 202 cases of Lyme disease during a 10-year period. The additional cost per QALY gained compared with no vaccination was $62 300. Vaccination cost $12 600/QALY gained for endemic areas with an attack rate of 2.5% per season, and $145 200/QALY gained for an attack rate of 0.5%. Vaccinating individuals over an accelerated 2-month vaccination schedule improved the cost-effectiveness to $53 700/QALY gained. If a yearly booster shot is required for persisting efficacy, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio increases to $72 700/QALY. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination was most sensitive to the Lyme disease treatment efficacy and assumptions about the persistence of vaccination effect. CONCLUSION: Vaccination against Lyme disease appears only to be economically attractive for individuals who have a seasonal probability of Borrelia burgdorferi infection of greater than 1%.",2001-01-02181,11252114,Arch Intern Med,N A Shadick,2001,161 / 4,554-61,No,11252114,"N A Shadick; M H Liang; C B Phillips; K Fossel; K M Kuntz; The cost-effectiveness of vaccination against Lyme disease, Arch Intern Med, 2001-Feb-26; 161(4):0003-9926; 554-61",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vaccinate against Lyme disease vs. No vaccination against Lyme disease,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,62300,United States,1998,98919.79
1398,Cost-effectiveness of combined outreach for the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis as part of a randomized, controlled trial of a community-based outreach initiative to promote the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines for people aged 65 years or older. METHODS: The analysis was based on primary data from the trial on the increase in vaccination rates and cost of the intervention, and published estimates of the effectiveness of the vaccines and cost of treatment. We performed partial stochastic analyses based on the confidence intervals (CIs) of the effectiveness of the intervention and of the vaccines. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratio of the combined-outreach initiative as implemented was $35 486 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), whereas it was $53 547 per QALY for the pneumococcal vaccine and $130 908 per QALY for the influenza vaccine. In partial stochastic analyses, the quasi-CI of the combined-outreach initiative ranged from $15 145 to $152 311 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness ratio of the intervention targeted to people who had never received the pneumococcal vaccine or who had not received the influenza vaccine in the previous year was $11 771 per QALY, with a quasi-CI of $3330 to $46 095 per QALY. With the use of the projected cost of replicating the intervention, the cost-effectiveness ratio was $26 512 per QALY for the initiative as implemented and $7843 per QALY for a targeted initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The community-based outreach initiative to promote the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines was reasonably cost-effective.
