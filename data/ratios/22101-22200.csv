22101,Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Screening for Colorectal Cancer Based on Polygenic Risk and Family History,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for personalizing colorectal cancer screening based on risk factors. We compared the cost-effectiveness of personalized colorectal cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family history to uniform screening. METHODS: Using the MISCAN-Colon model, we simulated a cohort of 100 million 40-year-olds, offering them uniform or personalized screening. Individuals were categorized based on polygenic risk and family history of colorectal cancer. We varied screening strategies by start age, interval and test and estimated costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In our analysis, we (i) assessed the cost-effectiveness of uniform screening; (ii) developed personalized screening scenarios based on optimal screening strategies by risk group; and (iii) compared the cost-effectiveness of both. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the optimal uniform screening scenario was annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) from ages 50 to 74 years, whereas for personalized screening the optimal screening scenario consisted of annual and biennial FIT screening except for those at highest risk who were offered 5-yearly colonoscopy from age 50 years. Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48. CONCLUSIONS: Uniform colorectal cancer screening currently appears more cost-effective than personalized screening based on polygenic risk and family history. However, cost-effectiveness is highly dependent on the cost of determining risk. IMPACT: Personalized screening could become increasingly viable as costs for determining risk decrease.",2019-01-31297,31748260,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,Dayna R Cenin,2019,/,,No,31748260,"Dayna R Cenin; David J Keene; Joseph Alsousou; Paul Harrison; Philippa Hulley; Susan Wagland; Scott R Parsons; Jacqueline Y Thompson; Heather M O'Connor; Michael Maia Schlussel; Susan J Dutton; Sarah E Lamb; Keith Willett; PATH-2 trial group; Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Screening for Colorectal Cancer Based on Polygenic Risk and Family History, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 2019 Jun 11; ():1055-9965",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Screening,colonoscopy vs. Fecal immunochemical testing -40 years at 1 year interval,Polygenic risk and family history of colorectal cancer,Not Stated,41 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-71035.17,Australia,2016,-56965.12

22113,Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Screening for Colorectal Cancer Based on Polygenic Risk and Family History,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for personalizing colorectal cancer screening based on risk factors. We compared the cost-effectiveness of personalized colorectal cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family history to uniform screening. METHODS: Using the MISCAN-Colon model, we simulated a cohort of 100 million 40-year-olds, offering them uniform or personalized screening. Individuals were categorized based on polygenic risk and family history of colorectal cancer. We varied screening strategies by start age, interval and test and estimated costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In our analysis, we (i) assessed the cost-effectiveness of uniform screening; (ii) developed personalized screening scenarios based on optimal screening strategies by risk group; and (iii) compared the cost-effectiveness of both. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the optimal uniform screening scenario was annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) from ages 50 to 74 years, whereas for personalized screening the optimal screening scenario consisted of annual and biennial FIT screening except for those at highest risk who were offered 5-yearly colonoscopy from age 50 years. Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48.

22125,Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Screening for Colorectal Cancer Based on Polygenic Risk and Family History,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for personalizing colorectal cancer screening based on risk factors. We compared the cost-effectiveness of personalized colorectal cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family history to uniform screening. METHODS: Using the MISCAN-Colon model, we simulated a cohort of 100 million 40-year-olds, offering them uniform or personalized screening. Individuals were categorized based on polygenic risk and family history of colorectal cancer. We varied screening strategies by start age, interval and test and estimated costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In our analysis, we (i) assessed the cost-effectiveness of uniform screening; (ii) developed personalized screening scenarios based on optimal screening strategies by risk group; and (iii) compared the cost-effectiveness of both. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the optimal uniform screening scenario was annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) from ages 50 to 74 years, whereas for personalized screening the optimal screening scenario consisted of annual and biennial FIT screening except for those at highest risk who were offered 5-yearly colonoscopy from age 50 years. Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48.

22137,Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Screening for Colorectal Cancer Based on Polygenic Risk and Family History,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for personalizing colorectal cancer screening based on risk factors. We compared the cost-effectiveness of personalized colorectal cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family history to uniform screening. METHODS: Using the MISCAN-Colon model, we simulated a cohort of 100 million 40-year-olds, offering them uniform or personalized screening. Individuals were categorized based on polygenic risk and family history of colorectal cancer. We varied screening strategies by start age, interval and test and estimated costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In our analysis, we (i) assessed the cost-effectiveness of uniform screening; (ii) developed personalized screening scenarios based on optimal screening strategies by risk group; and (iii) compared the cost-effectiveness of both. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the optimal uniform screening scenario was annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) from ages 50 to 74 years, whereas for personalized screening the optimal screening scenario consisted of annual and biennial FIT screening except for those at highest risk who were offered 5-yearly colonoscopy from age 50 years. Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person). Personalized screening was cost-effective when these costs were less than approximately $48.

22149,Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Screening for Colorectal Cancer Based on Polygenic Risk and Family History,"BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence for personalizing colorectal cancer screening based on risk factors. We compared the cost-effectiveness of personalized colorectal cancer screening based on polygenic risk and family history to uniform screening. METHODS: Using the MISCAN-Colon model, we simulated a cohort of 100 million 40-year-olds, offering them uniform or personalized screening. Individuals were categorized based on polygenic risk and family history of colorectal cancer. We varied screening strategies by start age, interval and test and estimated costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). In our analysis, we (i) assessed the cost-effectiveness of uniform screening; (ii) developed personalized screening scenarios based on optimal screening strategies by risk group; and (iii) compared the cost-effectiveness of both. RESULTS: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, the optimal uniform screening scenario was annual fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) from ages 50 to 74 years, whereas for personalized screening the optimal screening scenario consisted of annual and biennial FIT screening except for those at highest risk who were offered 5-yearly colonoscopy from age 50 years. Although these scenarios gained the same number of QALYs (17,887), personalized screening was not cost-effective, costing an additional $428,953 due to costs associated with determining risk (assumed to be $240 per person).

22153,Early economic evaluation of MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) and epilepsy surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy,"BACKGROUND: MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) is a new minimally invasive treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), with limited effectiveness data. It is unknown if the cost savings associated with shorter hospitalization could offset the high equipment cost of MRgLITT. We examined the cost-utility of MRgLITT versus surgery for TLE from healthcare payer perspective, and the value of additional research to inform policy decision on MRgLITT. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to evaluate quality adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of MRgLITT versus surgery in TLE, assuming life-time horizon and 1.5% discount rate. Model inputs were derived from the literature. We conducted threshold and sensitivity analyses to examine parameter uncertainties, and expected value of partial perfect information analyses to evaluate the expected monetary benefit of eliminating uncertainty on probabilities associated with MRgLITT. RESULTS: MRgLITT yielded 0.08 more QALYs and cost $7,821 higher than surgery, with ICER of $94,350/QALY. Influential parameters that could change model outcomes include probabilities of becoming seizure-free from disabling seizures state and returning to disabling seizures from seizure-free state 5 years after surgery and MRgLITT, cost of MRgLITT disposable equipment, and utilities of disabling seizures and seizure-free states of surgery and MRgLITT. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed surgery was preferred in more than 50% of iterations. The expected monetary benefit of eliminating uncertainty for probabilities associated with MRgLITT was higher than for utilities associated with MRgLITT. CONCLUSIONS: MRgLITT resulted in more QALYs gained and higher costs compared to surgery in the base-case. The model was sensitive to variations in the cost of MRgLITT disposable equipment. There is value in conducting more research to reduce uncertainty on the probabilities and utilities of MRgLITT, but priority should be given to research focusing on improving the precision of estimates on effectiveness of MRgLITT.",2019-01-31302,31747402,PLoS One,Elysa Widjaja,2019,14 / 11,e0224571,No,31747402,"Elysa Widjaja; N Wickramasekera; A Howard; P Philips; G Rooney; J Hughes; E Wilson; A Aber; J Michaels; P Shackley; Early economic evaluation of MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (MRgLITT) and epilepsy surgery for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, PLoS One , 2019; 14(11):1932-6203; e0224571",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",mri-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy vs. Surgery,medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,94350,Canada,2018,75053.44
22154,Cost-Effectiveness of Therapeutic Use of Safety-Engineered Syringes in Healthcare Facilities in India,"BACKGROUND: Globally, 16 billion injections are administered each year of which 95% are for curative care. India contributes 25-30% of the global injection load. Over 63% of these injections are reportedly unsafe or deemed unnecessary. OBJECTIVES: To assess the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with the introduction of safety-engineered syringes (SES) as compared to disposable syringes for therapeutic care in India. METHODS: A decision tree was used to compute the volume of needle-stick injuries (NSIs) and reuse episodes among healthcare professionals and the patient population. Subsequently, three separate Markov models were used to compute lifetime costs and QALYs for individuals infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Three SES were evaluated-reuse prevention syringe (RUP), sharp injury prevention (SIP) syringe, and syringes with features of both RUP and SIP. A lifetime study horizon starting from a base year of 2017 was considered appropriate to cover all costs and consequences comprehensively. A systematic review was undertaken to assess the SES effects in terms of reduction in NSIs and reuse episodes. These were then modelled in terms of reduction in transmission of blood-borne infections, life-years and QALYs gained. Future costs and consequences were discounted at the rate of 3%. Incremental cost per QALY gained was computed to assess the cost-effectiveness. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The introduction of RUP, SIP and RUP + SIP syringes in India is estimated to incur an incremental cost of Indian National Rupee (INR) 61,028 (US$939), INR 7,768,215 (US$119,511) and INR 196,135 (US$3017) per QALY gained, respectively.

22158,Cost-Effectiveness of Sacral Neuromodulation versus OnabotulinumtoxinA for Refractory Urgency Urinary Incontinence: Results of the ROSETTA Randomized Trial,"PURPOSE: Sacral neuromodulation and intradetrusor injection of onabotulinumtoxinA are therapies for refractory urgency-urinary incontinence. Sacral neuromodulation involves surgical implant of a device that can last 4-6 years, while onabotulinumtoxinA involves serial office injections. Objective was to assess cost-effectiveness of 2-stage implantation sacral neuromodulation versus 200 units onabotulinumtoxinA for the treatment of urgency-urinary incontinence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective economic evaluation concurrent with Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation v. BoTulinum Toxin Assessment (ROSETTA) randomized trial of 386 women with >/= 6 urgency-urinary-incontinence episodes in 3-day diary. Analysis from healthcare system perspective, with primary within-trial analysis for 2 years and secondary 5-year decision analysis. Costs in 2018 U.S. dollars. Effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and reductions in urgency-urinary-incontinence episodes/day. Generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Two-year costs were higher for sacral neuromodulation versus onabotulinumtoxinA ($35,680 [95%CI $33,920-$37,440] versus $7,460 [95%CI $5,780-$9,150], p<0.01), persisting through 5 years ($36,550 [95%CI $34,787-$38,309] versus $12,020 [95%CI $10,330-$13,700], p<0.01). At 2 years, there were no differences in mean reduction in urgency-urinary-incontinence episodes/day (-3.00 [95%CI -3.38 - -2.62] versus -3.12 [95%CI -3.48 - -2.76], p=0.66) or QALYs (1.39 [95%CI 1.34-1.44] versus 1.41 [95%CI 1.36-1.45], p=0.60). The probability that sacral neuromodulation is cost effective relative to onabotulinumtoxinA is less than 0.025 for all willingness-to-pay values below $580,000/QALY at 2 years and $204,000/QALY at 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although both treatments were effective, the high cost of sacral neuromodulation is not good value for treating urgency-urinary incontinence compared with 200 units onabotulinumtoxinA.",2019-01-31333,31738113,J Urol,Heidi S Harvie,2019,/,101097JU0000000000000656,No,31738113,"Heidi S Harvie; Han Joo Choi; Hyung Jun Moon; Won Jung Jeong; Gi Woon Kim; Jae Hyug Woo; Kyoung Mi Lee; Hyuk Joong Choi; Yong Jin Park; Choung Ah Lee; Cost-Effectiveness of Sacral Neuromodulation versus OnabotulinumtoxinA for Refractory Urgency Urinary Incontinence: Results of the ROSETTA Randomized Trial, J Urol, 2019 May 21; ():0022-5347; 101097JU0000000000000656",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Surgical",2-stage implantation sacral neuromodulation vs. 200 units onabotulinumtoxin A,Not Stated,75 Years,51 Years,Female,Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-1411000,United States,2018,-1454289.69
22159,Cost-Effectiveness of Treating Early to Moderate Stage Knee Osteoarthritis with Intra-articular Hyaluronic Acid Compared to Conservative Interventions,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence has demonstrated greater benefit of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IA-HA) within earlier stages of knee osteoarthritis (OA) rather than waiting for patients to have progressed to later stages of disease progression. High molecular weight (HMW) HA has also been shown to be more effective than low molecular weight (LMW) HA products in mild to moderate knee OA, providing an important distinction to make within the class of IA-HA therapies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with knee OA with HMW HA compared to LMW and conservative treatment, while taking into account disease stage. METHODS: Decision analytic models were created for early/moderate, as well as late stage knee OA. Models for late stage knee OA were created by assuming a range of response rates to IA-HA treatments from 10% to 50%. These models included conservative treatment using physical therapy/exercise, braces/orthosis, and medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics. The models compared the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained for these treatments to the use of either LMW or HMW HA. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each treatment in relation to HMW HA. RESULTS: When evaluating treatment in early to moderate knee OA, HMW HA was dominant over LMW HA and physical therapy/exercise, as it was less expensive and provided greater benefit. HMW HA was cost-effective versus braces/orthosis and NSAID/analgesic medications based on a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000. In the model of 50% response rate to IA-HA for late stage OA, HMW HA remained cost-effective in comparison to physical therapy/exercise and braces/orthosis at a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000; but not NSAID/analgesic medications. In the worst-case scenario of a 10% responder rate to IA-HA, HMW HA was no longer cost-effective in any circumstance. CONCLUSION: IA-HA, particularly HMW formulations, demonstrate cost-effectiveness when compared to conservative treatment options and LMW HA in patients with early/mid stage knee OA. The cost-effectiveness of HMW HA in patients with later stage knee OA was not as apparent, particularly because of the uncertainty in the proportion of patients with late stage OA who have a meaningful improvement after receiving IA-HA. This cost-effectiveness finding supports the use of IA-HA in patients with early and moderate knee OA, as the benefits of IA-HA are apparent within the patient population with mild to moderate knee OA. The findings of this study suggest that there is a potential cost savings benefit as a result of utilizing HMW HA in earlier stages of knee OA as opposed to later stages.

22160,Cost-Effectiveness of Treating Early to Moderate Stage Knee Osteoarthritis with Intra-articular Hyaluronic Acid Compared to Conservative Interventions,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence has demonstrated greater benefit of intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IA-HA) within earlier stages of knee osteoarthritis (OA) rather than waiting for patients to have progressed to later stages of disease progression. High molecular weight (HMW) HA has also been shown to be more effective than low molecular weight (LMW) HA products in mild to moderate knee OA, providing an important distinction to make within the class of IA-HA therapies. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with knee OA with HMW HA compared to LMW and conservative treatment, while taking into account disease stage. METHODS: Decision analytic models were created for early/moderate, as well as late stage knee OA. Models for late stage knee OA were created by assuming a range of response rates to IA-HA treatments from 10% to 50%. These models included conservative treatment using physical therapy/exercise, braces/orthosis, and medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics. The models compared the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained for these treatments to the use of either LMW or HMW HA. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for each treatment in relation to HMW HA. RESULTS: When evaluating treatment in early to moderate knee OA, HMW HA was dominant over LMW HA and physical therapy/exercise, as it was less expensive and provided greater benefit.

RESULTS: A scenario targeting children under 15 was expected to reduce the number of cases 6,382,345 compared to the current strategy. A scenario targeting elderly population (age over 49years) was expected to reduce the number of cases 693,206.

22169,A model to determine the cost-effectiveness of screening psoriasis patients for psoriatic arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: Screening psoriasis patients for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is intended to identify patients at earlier stages of the disease. Early treatment is expected to slow disease progression and delay the need for biologic therapy. This paper determines the cost-effectiveness of screening for PsA in patients with psoriasis in Canada. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of screening tools for PsA in psoriasis patients. The screening tools included the ToPAS, PEST, PASE; and EARP questionnaires. Health states were defined by disability levels as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). State transitions were modelled based on annual disease progression. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and Incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs) were estimated. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for parameter uncertainty and test model assumptions. RESULTS: Screening was cost-effective compared to ''no screening''. The EARP had the lowest total cost ($2,000 per patient per year saved compared to No Screening) and highest total QALYs (additional 0.18 per patient compared to No Screening). The results were most sensitive to test accuracy and DMARD efficacy. ''No Screening'' was cost-effective (at $50,000 per QALY) relative to screening when DMARDs failed to slow disease progression.

22172,A model to determine the cost-effectiveness of screening psoriasis patients for psoriatic arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: Screening psoriasis patients for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is intended to identify patients at earlier stages of the disease. Early treatment is expected to slow disease progression and delay the need for biologic therapy. This paper determines the cost-effectiveness of screening for PsA in patients with psoriasis in Canada. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of screening tools for PsA in psoriasis patients. The screening tools included the ToPAS, PEST, PASE; and EARP questionnaires. Health states were defined by disability levels as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). State transitions were modelled based on annual disease progression. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and Incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs) were estimated. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to account for parameter uncertainty and test model assumptions. RESULTS: Screening was cost-effective compared to ''no screening''. The EARP had the lowest total cost ($2,000 per patient per year saved compared to No Screening) and highest total QALYs (additional 0.18 per patient compared to No Screening). The results were most sensitive to test accuracy and DMARD efficacy. ''No Screening'' was cost-effective (at $50,000 per QALY) relative to screening when DMARDs failed to slow disease progression.

22173,Real-World Effectiveness and Real-World Cost-Effectiveness of Intravitreal Aflibercept and Intravitreal Ranibizumab in Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Real-World Studies,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) has evolved with the advent of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents such that intravitreally administered aflibercept and ranibizumab (RBZ) have become the standard of care. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated the benefits of these agents in nAMD; however, results achieved under RCT protocols may not always be replicated in clinical practice. Assessing real-world outcomes is important to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these two agents. Our objective was to assess the real-world effectiveness of intravitreally administered aflibercept and RBZ in treatment-naive patients with nAMD and determine the cost-effectiveness of intravitreally administered aflibercept versus RBZ in a real-world setting. METHODS: A multistage approach was undertaken. A systematic literature review (SLR) was completed to identify studies describing real-world outcomes in patients with nAMD treated intravitreally with aflibercept or RBZ. A meta-analysis of data identified in the SLR generated a pooled estimate of the effectiveness of intravitreally administered aflibercept and RBZ at 52 weeks and an estimate of treatment burden (injection frequency and monitoring). The impact of treatment effect modifiers, such as baseline visual acuity (VA) and age, were corrected through a multivariable meta-regression. A Markov state transition model was developed to estimate the real-world cost-effectiveness of intravitreally administered aflibercept using results from the pooled estimates for effectiveness and treatment burden as primary inputs. The analysis considered the perspective of the French National Healthcare System. RESULTS: Patients treated intravitreally with aflibercept had a mean age of 79.52 years and mean baseline VA of 55.80 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters. At week 52, mean VA gain was 5.30 ETDRS letters in patients reporting an average of 7.10 intravitreal injections of aflibercept and 8.65 visits (injection and/or monitoring). RBZ-treated patients were younger (77.28 years), with a lower mean baseline VA (52.81 ETDRS letters). At week 52, mean VA gain from baseline was 4.24 ETDRS letters, with an average of 5.88 injections and 10.10 visits (injection and/or monitoring). After correcting for differences in age (77.28 years) and baseline VA (52.81 ETDRS letters) and considering the current clinical practice with aflibercept and RBZ, the mean VA gain was 6.57 ETDRS letters for patients treated intravitreally with aflibercept and 4.42 ETDRS for patients treated intravitreally with RBZ. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that intravitreally administered aflibercept is a more effective treatment option with an incremental gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (4.918 versus 4.880) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro27,087 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis identified differences in the overall treatment approach and how ophthalmologists use intravitreally administered aflibercept and RBZ in clinical practice. These differences ultimately influence the mean real-world effectiveness of the two agents. Intravitreal treatment with aflibercept (injection frequency and patients follow-up) was consistent and in line with the European label recommendations. Patients treated intravitreally with aflibercept in clinical practice reported a mean gain in VA of similar magnitude to the mean VA gain reported in the pivotal RCT. Conversely, treatment with RBZ varied significantly across the different studies. On average, RBZ-treated patients reported a low injection frequency and a frequent follow-up, driven in part by the high number of patients treated with pro re nata (PRN) regimens. RBZ-treated patients reported gains in VA versus baseline; however, the magnitude of the gain in VA was not comparable to the VA gains reported in the RBZ pivotal RCT. Intravitreal treatment with aflibercept was associated with better mean VA outcomes and an incremental gain in QALYs compared with RBZ and can be considered cost-effective for the treatment of nAMD in patients in France despite a higher price for each individual intravitreal injection of aflibercept compared with RBZ.

22178,The cost-effectiveness of extended-release calcifediol versus paricalcitol for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in stage 3-4 CKD,"Aims: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not on dialysis frequently have vitamin D insufficiency (VDI) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, fracture, CKD progression, and death. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of extended-release calcifediol (ERC) vs paricalcitol for the treatment of patients with CKD stages 3-4 that have SHPT and VDI.Materials and methods: An economic analysis of SHPT treatments among a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients with CKD Stage 3 and 4 with SHPT and VDI was developed to estimate differences in the rates and costs of CV events, fractures, CKD stage progression, and mortality in patients treated with ERC and paricalcitol. A Markov model was developed with 1-year cycles and a 5-year time horizon from a US Medicare payer perspective with costs valued in 2017 US dollars.Results: The outcomes of the model were rates of clinical events, total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Across a 1,000-person cohort, ERC was the dominant (less costly, more effective) treatment strategy when compared with paricalcitol. Treatment with ERC resulted in cost savings of $14.8 M (95% CI = -$10.0 M-$45.2 M) and an incremental gain of 340 QALYs (95% CI = 200-496) compared to treatment with paricalcitol.Limitations: Bridging biochemical levels to clinical outcomes may not represent real-world risk of the clinical events modeled. Future real-world outcomes of patients treated with ERC and paricalcitol may be used to evaluate the model results.Conclusions: This model demonstrated favorable short- and long-term clinical benefits associated with the use of ERC in patients with CKD Stage 3 and 4 with SHPT and VDI, suggesting ERC may be cost-effective from the Medicare perspective compared to paricalcitol.",2019-01-31352,31726882,J Med Econ,Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh,2019,/,1-8,Yes,31726882,"Kamyar Kalantar-Zadeh; Jana Thomas; Sebastiaan Overeem; Jurgen A H R Claassen; The cost-effectiveness of extended-release calcifediol versus paricalcitol for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in stage 3-4 CKD, J Med Econ, 2019 Jun 21; ():1369-6998; 1-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,extended-release calcifediol vs. Standard/Usual Care- Paricalcitol,Chronic Kidney Disease stages 3–4; vitamin D defficiency; secondary hyperparathyroidism,68 Years,67 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-43541.18,United States,2017,-45973.14

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model was developed to assess the impact on costs and outcomes of using Neuropad as a test for diabetic neuropathy (1) as a complement to the standard test, the 10-g monofilament (Neuropad + monofilament vs. monofilament); and (2) as a substitute for the monofilament (Neuropad vs. monofilament); from the healthcare provider perspective. The time horizon was 3 years. Data on costs and health gains were extracted from the literature. The incremental cost-utility ratio was calculated. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Compared with standard care, Neuropad, in combination with the 10-g monofilament tool, is the dominant strategy as it leads to higher health gains and lower costs. In practice, compared with using the monofilament alone, performing both tests would lead to a savings of pound1049.26 per patient and 0.044 QALY gain. Results were found to be consistent across the sensitivity analyses.

At 1 year, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups meaning there is inadequate evidence to support manual or exercise therapy. INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different physiotherapy approaches for people with osteoporotic vertebral fracture(s) (OVF). METHODS: >Prospective, multicentre, adaptive, three-arm randomised controlled trial. Six hundred fifteen adults with back pain, osteoporosis, and at least 1 OVF participated. INTERVENTIONS: 7 individual physiotherapy sessions over 12 weeks focused on either manual therapy or home exercise compared with a single session of physiotherapy education (SSPT). The co-primary outcomes were quality of life and back muscle endurance measured by the QUALEFFO-41 and timed loaded standing (TLS) test at 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months, there were no statistically significant differences between groups. Mean QUALEFFO-41: - 1.3 (exercise), - 0.15 (manual), and - 1.2 (SSPT), a mean difference of - 0.2 (95% CI, - 3.2 to 1.6) for exercise and 1.3 (95% CI, - 1.8 to 2.9) for manual therapy. Mean TLS: 9.8 s (exercise), 13.6 s (manual), and 4.2 s (SSPT), a mean increase of 5.8 s (95% CI, - 4.8 to 20.5) for exercise and 9.7 s (95% CI, 0.1 to 24.9) for manual therapy.

22183,The economic research of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia in China,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to conduct the first systematic evaluation of the long-term economic impact of arsenic trioxide (ATO) plus all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) from the perspective of the Chinese health care system. METHODS: On the basis of clinical data from a randomized phase 3 trial, a time-dependent Markov model with 4 health states (complete remission, relapse or treatment failure, post-treatment failure, and death) was used to evaluate the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from the ATO plus ATRA regimen compared with the ATRA plus chemotherapy (CT) regimen over a 30-year period. All costs were adjusted to 2018 levels based on the Chinese Consumer Price Index. Both costs and health outcomes were discounted by 3% annually. One-way sensitivity analysis and probability sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: Compared with the ATRA plus CT strategy, the ATO plus ATRA strategy was associated with 1.38 additional QALYs gained and $392.05 (estimated in 2018 US dollars) in incremental costs per patient over 30 years. Consequently, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $284.02 per QALY gained, which was far below the Chinese willingness-to-pay threshold of $29,306 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of these results. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the Chinese health care system, the ATO plus ATRA strategy is cost-effective for patients with newly diagnosed APL compared with the ATRA plus CT strategy. Therefore, the authors strongly suggest that China''s health authorities choose the former strategy for these patients, whether for the elderly or for young people.",2019-01-31380,31714584,Cancer,Xichuang Chen,2019,/,,No,31714584,"Xichuang Chen; Charlotte Bradbury; Kate Fletcher; Yongzhong Sun; Carl Heneghan; Chris Gardiner; Andrea Roalfe; Pollyanna Hardy; Debbie McCahon; Gail Heritage; Helen Shackleford; Fd Richard Hobbs; David Fitzmaurice; The economic research of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia in China, Cancer, 2019 Jun 24; ():0008-543X",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,arsenic trioxide + all-trans retinoic acid vs. Standard/Usual Care- All-trans retinoic acid plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy,"Newly diagnosed, low-risk to intermediate-risk APL",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,284.02,United States,2018,292.73

AIMS: to model the cost-effectiveness of a fall-risk assessment (QTUG compared to TUG) with referral to one of four fall-prevention interventions (Otago, FaME, Tai Chi, home safety assessment and modification) compared to no care pathway, when the decision to screen is based on older age in a primary care setting for community-dwelling people. METHODS: a cohort-based, decision analytic Markov model was stratified by five age groupings (65-70, 70-75, 65-89, 70-89 and 75-89) to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs included fall-risk assessment, fall-prevention intervention and downstream resource use (e.g. inpatient and care home admission). Uncertainty was explored using univariate, bivariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: screening with QTUG dominates (>QALYs; <costs) screening with TUG irrespective of subsequent fall-prevention intervention. The QTUG-based care pathways relative to no care pathway have a high probability of cost-effectiveness in those aged 75-89 (>85%), relative to those aged 70-74 (~10 < 30%) or 65-69 (<10%). In the older age group, only a 10% referral uptake is required for the QTUG with FaME or Otago modelled care pathways to remain cost-effective.

22194,A modelling-based economic evaluation of primary-care-based fall-risk screening followed by fall-prevention intervention: a cohort-based Markov model stratified by older age groups,"BACKGROUND: fall-risk assessment with fall-prevention intervention referral for at-risk groups to avoid falls could be cost-effective from a care-payer perspective. AIMS: to model the cost-effectiveness of a fall-risk assessment (QTUG compared to TUG) with referral to one of four fall-prevention interventions (Otago, FaME, Tai Chi, home safety assessment and modification) compared to no care pathway, when the decision to screen is based on older age in a primary care setting for community-dwelling people. METHODS: a cohort-based, decision analytic Markov model was stratified by five age groupings (65-70, 70-75, 65-89, 70-89 and 75-89) to estimate cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs included fall-risk assessment, fall-prevention intervention and downstream resource use (e.g. inpatient and care home admission). Uncertainty was explored using univariate, bivariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: screening with QTUG dominates (>QALYs; <costs) screening with TUG irrespective of subsequent fall-prevention intervention. The QTUG-based care pathways relative to no care pathway have a high probability of cost-effectiveness in those aged 75-89 (>85%), relative to those aged 70-74 (~10 < 30%) or 65-69 (<10%). In the older age group, only a 10% referral uptake is required for the QTUG with FaME or Otago modelled care pathways to remain cost-effective.
