10201,Cost-effectiveness analysis of rosuvastatin vs generic atorvastatin in Spain,"Abstract Objective: The objective of this study was to carry out a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis of rosuvastatin compared with generic atorvastatin in the treatment of patients at high cardiovascular (CV) risk (=5% Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE]) and patients with prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Spain. Methods: The efficacy data from the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) study were used to simulate achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets with different doses of rosuvastatin and generic atorvastatin for an initial period of 1 year. A Markov model was used to estimate the number of CV complications, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and healthcare costs (lipid-lowering treatment and CV events) for up to 20 years after initial treatment. The analysis was carried out from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System, with costs (in year 2010 euros) and effects being discounted at 3% per year. Results: Compared with generic atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was cost-effective (cost per QALY gained of less than ?30,000) for the primary prevention of CV events in high-risk patients in most sub-groups analyzed. In patients with prior CVD, rosuvastatin was cost-effective in all sub-groups of men and most sub-groups of women. Key limitations of this study were the need to extrapolate data from a single trial to long-term modeled outcomes and the absence of other treatment options in the analysis. Conclusions: For the treatment of dyslipidemic patients with high CV risk, rosuvastatin is more effective than generic atorvastatin in terms of survival and quality-of-life adjusted survival, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios within the range generally used in Spain, in most sub-populations defined by various combinations of CV risk factors.",2012-01-09716,22954062,J Med Econ,Vivencio Barrios,2012,15Suppl1 /,45-54,Yes,22954062,"Vivencio Barrios; Jos?

10210,Cost-effective treatment of low-risk carcinoma not invading bladder muscle,"Study Type - Therapy (cost effectiveness analysis) Level of Evidence 2a What''s known on the subject? and What does the study add? Bladder cancer is one of the costliest malignancies to treat throughout the life of a patient. The most cost-effective management for low-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer is not known. The current study shows that employing cystoscopic office fulguration for low-risk appearing bladder cancer recurrences can materially impact the cost-effectiveness of therapy. In a follow-up protocol where office fulguration is routinely employed for low-risk bladder cancers, peri-operative intravesical chemotherapy may not provide any additional cost-effectiveness benefit. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of fulguration vs transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT) with and without perioperative intravesical chemotherapy (PIC) for managing low-risk carcinoma not invading bladder muscle (NMIBC). Low-risk NMIBC carries a low progression rate, lending support to the use of office-based fulguration for small recurrences rather than traditional TURBT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov state transition model was created to simulate treatment of NMIBC with vs without PIC, with recurrence treated by formal TURBT vs treatment with fulguration. Costing data were obtained from the Medicare Resource Based Relative Value Scale. Data regarding the success of PIC were obtained from the peer-reviewed literature, as were corresponding utilities for bladder cancer-related procedures. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, a strategy of fulguration without PIC was the most cost-effective (mean cost-effectiveness = US $654.8/quality-adjusted life year), despite a lower recurrence rate with PIC. Both fulguration strategies dominated each TURBT strategy. Sensitivity analysis showed that fulguration without PIC dominated all other strategies when the recurrence rate after PIC was increased to >/=14.2% per year. Similarly, the cost-effectiveness of TURBT becomes more competitive with fulguration when the total cost of TURBT declines < US $1175. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that fulguration without PIC was the most cost-effective strategy for treating low-risk NMIBC. The effectiveness of PIC and the cost of TURBT can materially impact the cost-effectiveness of the different management strategies.

10213,Cost-effectiveness of Dabigatran for Stroke Prevention in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Spain,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Assessment of the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation in Spain, from the perspective of the National Health System. METHODS: Adaptation of a Markov chain model that simulates the natural history of the disease over the lifetime of a cohort of 10?000 patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Model comparators were warfarin in a first scenario, and a real world prescribing pattern in a second scenario, in which 60% of the patients were treated with vitamin K antagonists, 30% with acetylsalicylic acid, and 10% received no treatment. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Dabigatran reduced the occurrence of clinical events in both scenarios, providing gains in quantity and quality of life. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for dabigatran compared to warfarin was 17 581 euros/quality-adjusted life year gained and 14 118 euros/quality-adjusted life year gained when compared to the real world prescribing pattern. Efficiency in subgroups was demonstrated. When the social costs were incorporated into the analysis, dabigatran was found to be a dominant strategy (ie, more effective and less costly). The model proved to be robust. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the Spanish National Health System, dabigatran is an efficient strategy for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation compared to warfarin and to the real-world prescribing pattern; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below the 30 000 euros/quality-adjusted life year threshold in both scenarios. Dabigatran would also be a dominant strategy from the societal perspective, providing society with a more effective therapy at a lower cost compared to the other 2 alternatives.

10217,The cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation support delivered by mobile phone text messaging: Txt2stop,"BACKGROUND: The txt2stop trial has shown that mobile-phone-based smoking cessation support doubles biochemically validated quitting at 6 months. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation support delivered by mobile phone text messaging. METHODS: The lifetime incremental costs and benefits of adding text-based support to current practice are estimated from a UK NHS perspective using a Markov model. The cost-effectiveness was measured in terms of cost per quitter, cost per life year gained and cost per QALY gained. As in previous studies, smokers are assumed to face a higher risk of experiencing the following five diseases: lung cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and coronary heart disease (i.e. the main fatal or disabling, but by no means the only, adverse effects of prolonged smoking). The treatment costs and health state values associated with these diseases were identified from the literature. The analysis was based on the age and gender distribution observed in the txt2stop trial. Effectiveness and cost parameters were varied in deterministic sensitivity analyses, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also performed. FINDINGS: The cost of text-based support per 1,000 enrolled smokers is pound16,120, which, given an estimated 58 additional quitters at 6 months, equates to pound278 per quitter. However, when the future NHS costs saved (as a result of reduced smoking) are included, text-based support would be cost saving. It is estimated that 18 LYs are gained per 1,000 smokers (0.3 LYs per quitter) receiving text-based support, and 29 QALYs are gained (0.5 QALYs per quitter). The deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated that changes in individual model parameters did not alter the conclusion that this is a cost-effective intervention.

This investigation compares the economic outcome at 5-year follow-up of the 3 therapeutic strategies.We analyzed cumulative costs during a 5-year follow-up period. To analyze the cost-effectiveness, adjustment was made on the cumulative costs for average event-free time and angina-free proportion. Respectively, for event-free survival and event plus angina-free survival, MT presented 3.79 quality-adjusted life-years and 2.07 quality-adjusted life-years; PCI presented 3.59 and 2.77 quality-adjusted life-years; and CABG demonstrated 4.4 and 2.81 quality-adjusted life-years. The event-free costs were $9071.00 for MT; $19,967.00 for PCI; and $18,263.00 for CABG. The paired comparison of the event-free costs showed that there was a significant difference favoring MT versus PCI (P<0.01) and versus CABG (P<0.01) and CABG versus PCI (P=0.01). The event-free plus angina-free costs were $16,553.00, $25,831.00, and $24,614.00, respectively.

Information about the cost-effectiveness of such interventions is lacking, but necessary to make informed implementation decisions. The purpose of this study was to perform an economic evaluation of a six-month program with lifestyle counseling aimed at weight reduction in an overweight working population with a two-year time horizon from a societal perspective.A randomized controlled trial comparing a program with two modes of intervention delivery against self-help. 1386 Employees from seven companies participated (67% male, mean age 43 (SD 8.6) years, mean BMI 29.6 (SD 3.5) kg/m2). All groups received self-directed lifestyle brochures. The two intervention groups additionally received a workbook-based program with phone counseling (phone; n=462) or a web-based program with e-mail counseling (internet; n=464).

10232,Comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty versus penetrating keratoplasty in the United States,"PURPOSE: To perform a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and penetrating keratoplasty (PK) for corneal endothelial disease. DESIGN: Retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: This cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective with a 5-year time horizon. Probabilities of outcomes and complications of each of the procedures were calculated based on review of the published literature. A model was constructed to compare the costs and utilities associated with DSAEK and PK. Costs of donor tissue preparation, surgery, follow-up, postoperative complications, and procedures were considered. Utility values were based on quality-adjusted life years associated with visual acuity outcomes. Both costs and utilities were discounted at 3% per year. Sensitivity analyses were performed on key model inputs. RESULTS: Base case analysis found DSAEK to be less costly compared with PK ($9362 vs $10 239), with greater utility (3.15 vs 2.47 quality-adjusted life years). Sensitivity analyses revealed that even at graft failure rates for DSAEK approaching the rates for PK, DSAEK would still reduce costs. Varying the dislocation rate in our model showed that even at dislocation rates approaching 50%, DSAEK remained less costly. Further, with DSAEK rejection rates as high as 28%, DSAEK would remain a dominant procedure over PK. CONCLUSIONS: Comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of DSAEK versus PK indicates favorable cost and utility outcomes associated with DSAEK for treatment of corneal endothelial disease. Longer follow-up of DSAEK outcomes will provide more accurate information regarding long-term cost-effectiveness of the procedure.",2012-01-09743,22967866,Am J Ophthalmol,Shreya S Prabhu,2013,155 / 1,,No,22967866,"Shreya S Prabhu; Rola Kaakeh; Alan Sugar; Dean G Smith; Roni M Shtein; Comparative cost-effectiveness analysis of descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty versus penetrating keratoplasty in the United States, Am J Ophthalmol, 2013 Jan; 155(1):0002-9394",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Descement stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) vs. Penetrating keratoplasty (PK),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-1289.71,United States,2010,-1530.75

This study determines the cost per QALY (quality-adjusted life year), out-of-pocket expenses, and lifetime costs for PMV patients stratified by underlying diseases and cognition levels.A nationwide sample of 50,481 patients with continual mechanical ventilation for more than 21 days was collected during 1997-2007. After stratifying the patients according to specific diagnoses, a latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to categorise PMV patients with multiple co-morbidities into several homogeneous groups. The survival functions were estimated for individual groups using the Kaplan-Meier method and extrapolated to 300 months through a semi-parametric method. The survival functions were adjusted using an EQ-5D utility value derived from a convenience sample of 142 PMV patients to estimate quality-adjusted life expectancies (QALE). Another convenience sample of 165 patients was used to estimate the out-of-pocket expenses. The lifetime expenditures paid by the single-payer National Health Insurance (NHI) system and patients' families were estimated by multiplying average monthly expenditures by the survival probabilities and summing the values over lifetime.PMV therapy costs more than 100,000 U.S. dollars (USD) per QALY for all patients with poor cognition. For patients with partial cognition, PMV therapy costs less than 56,000 USD per QALY for those with liver cirrhosis, intracranial or spinal cord injuries, and 57,000-69,000 USD for patients with multiple co-morbidities under age of 65. The average lifetime cost of PMV was usually below 56,000 USD. The out-of-pocket expenses were often more than one-third of the total cost of treatment.PMV treatment for patients with poor cognition would cost more than 5 times Taiwan's GDP (gross domestic products), or less cost-effective.

The survival functions were adjusted using an EQ-5D utility value derived from a convenience sample of 142 PMV patients to estimate quality-adjusted life expectancies (QALE). Another convenience sample of 165 patients was used to estimate the out-of-pocket expenses. The lifetime expenditures paid by the single-payer National Health Insurance (NHI) system and patients' families were estimated by multiplying average monthly expenditures by the survival probabilities and summing the values over lifetime.PMV therapy costs more than 100,000 U.S. dollars (USD) per QALY for all patients with poor cognition. For patients with partial cognition, PMV therapy costs less than 56,000 USD per QALY for those with liver cirrhosis, intracranial or spinal cord injuries, and 57,000-69,000 USD for patients with multiple co-morbidities under age of 65. The average lifetime cost of PMV was usually below 56,000 USD. The out-of-pocket expenses were often more than one-third of the total cost of treatment.PMV treatment for patients with poor cognition would cost more than 5 times Taiwan's GDP (gross domestic products), or less cost-effective. The out-of-pocket expenses for PMV provision should also be considered in policy decision.",2012-01-09747,22970160,PLoS One,Mei-Chuan Hung,2012,7 / 9,e44043,No,22970160,"Mei-Chuan Hung; Hsin-Ming Lu; Likwang Chen; Ming-Shian Lin; Cheng-Ren Chen; Chong-Jen Yu; Jung-Der Wang; Cost per QALY (quality-adjusted life year) and lifetime cost of prolonged mechanical ventilation in Taiwan, PLoS One , ; 7(9):1932-6203; e44043",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prolonged mechanical ventilation (>21 days) vs. None (no reference group available),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,134730,United States,2010,159911.24
10235,The cost-effectiveness of rapid HIV testing in substance abuse treatment: results of a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: The President''s National HIV/AIDS Strategy calls for coupling HIV screening and prevention services with substance abuse treatment programs. Fewer than half of US community-based substance abuse treatment programs make HIV testing available on-site or through referral. METHODS: We measured the cost-effectiveness of three HIV testing strategies evaluated in a randomized trial conducted in 12 community-based substance abuse treatment programs in 2009: off-site testing referral, on-site rapid testing with information only, on-site rapid testing with risk-reduction counseling. Data from the trial included patient demographics, prior testing history, test acceptance and receipt of results, undiagnosed HIV prevalence (0.4%) and program costs. The Cost-Effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications (CEPAC) computer simulation model was used to project life expectancy, lifetime costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for HIV-infected individuals. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2009 US $/QALY) were calculated after adding costs of testing HIV-uninfected individuals; costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: Referral for off-site testing is less efficient (dominated) compared to offering on-site testing with information only. The cost-effectiveness ratio for on-site testing with information is $60,300/QALY in the base case, or $76,300/QALY with 0.1% undiagnosed HIV prevalence. HIV risk-reduction counseling costs $36 per person more without additional benefit. CONCLUSIONS: A strategy of on-site rapid HIV testing offer with information only in substance abuse treatment programs increases life expectancy at a cost-effectiveness ratio <$100,000/QALY. Policymakers and substance abuse treatment leaders should seek funding to implement on-site rapid HIV testing in substance abuse treatment programs for those not recently tested.",2012-01-09751,22971593,Drug Alcohol Depend,Bruce R Schackman,2013,128 / 1-2,,No,22971593,"Bruce R Schackman; Lisa R Metsch; Grant N Colfax; Jared A Leff; Angela Wong; Callie A Scott; Daniel J Feaster; Lauren Gooden; Tim Matheson; Louise F Haynes; A David Paltiel; Rochelle P Walensky; The cost-effectiveness of rapid HIV testing in substance abuse treatment: results of a randomized trial, Drug Alcohol Depend, 2013 Feb 1; 128(1-2):0376-8716",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,On-site rapid HIV test with information describing testing procedure but no counseling about risk behaviors vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,60300,United States,2009,72744.11

We applied this evidence in a decision-analytic model to re-evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the assay. METHODS: We cross-classified patients by clinicopathologic characteristics from the Adjuvant! risk index and by recurrence score risk group. For non-recurrence score-guided treatment, we assumed patients receiving hormonal therapy alone had low-risk characteristics and patients receiving chemotherapy and hormonal therapy had higher-risk characteristics. For recurrence score-guided treatment, we assigned chemotherapy probabilities conditional on recurrence score risk group and clinicopathologic characteristics. RESULTS: An estimated 40.4% of patients in the recurrence score-guided strategy and 47.3% in the non-recurrence score-guided strategy were expected to receive chemotherapy. The incremental gain in quality-adjusted life-years was 0.16 (95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.28) with the recurrence score-guided strategy. Lifetime medical costs to the health system were $2,692 ($1,546-$3,821) higher with the recurrence score-guided strategy, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $16,677/quality-adjusted life-year ($7,613-$37,219). From a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness was $10,788/quality-adjusted life-year ($6,840-$30,265).

10238,Cost-effectiveness analysis of top-down versus step-up strategies in patients with newly diagnosed active luminal Crohn's disease,"BACKGROUND: Top-down (TD) strategy with frontline infliximab proved to be more effective than the traditional step-up (SU) approach in newly diagnosed luminal moderate-to-severe CD patients. However, the considerable cost of infliximab calls its universal use as frontline treatment into question. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the TD approach using a Markov decision model. METHODS: Four states were modelled, namely step 1, step 2, step 3 and death. The first three steps were in TD infliximab induction plus azathioprine, infliximab rechallenge plus azathioprine and steroids plus azathioprine, and in SU steroid induction, azathioprine plus steroid rechallenge and infliximab plus azathioprine. Each health state lasted 1 month. The time horizon of the model was 5 years. Transition probabilities and quality of life were estimated from a randomised trial. First- and second-order sensitivity analyses were done to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: At baseline analysis, TD improved quality-adjusted life expectancy from 3.76 to 3.90 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), that is, 0.14 QALYs, while allowing a saving of euro 773, proving dominant when compared to SU. TD was cost-saving in 66% of the Monte Carlo simulations and cost <euro 20,000/QALY in 84%. At sensitivity analysis the most significant variables were infliximab cost and time horizon: doubling infliximab cost (euro 1,000 per 100 mg vial) resulted in an incremental cost-utility ratio of euro 12,114/QALY.

10260,Cost-effectiveness of alemtuzumab for T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H) compared with conventional chemotherapy in people with T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL).We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the costs and benefits of alemtuzumab or conventional therapy based on their effects on quality of life of patients. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio incorporating costs per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over lifetime. Due to the limited data available, a large number of assumptions had to be made to construct the cost-utility model. One-way, multi-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore the impact of these uncertainties. Expected values of perfect information were also calculated for four specific scenarios.Depending on different key assumptions made, the PSA suggested distinct conclusions using a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 GBP per QALY gained. Using this threshold, the probability that alemtuzumab would be cost-effective varies from 0 percent to 53 percent for the four modeled scenarios. Population expected value of perfect information analysis suggests that resolving the parameter uncertainty in the analysis for people with T-PLL in the United Kingdom would have considerable value--up to 5.3 million euro.Alemtuzumab appears more likely to be cost-effective if used earlier in the course of T-PLL and where it replaces the use of multiple alternative therapies.

In the Symplicity HTN-2 randomized controlled trial, catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) lowered systolic blood pressure by 32 ? 23 mm Hg from 178 ? 18 mm Hg at baseline.A state-transition model was used to predict the effect of RDN and standard of care on 10-year and lifetime probabilities of stroke, myocardial infarction, all coronary heart disease, heart failure, end-stage renal disease, and median survival.

A cost-utility analysis based on data from the AOSpine North America prospective CSM study,"Surgical intervention for appropriately selected patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) has demonstrated favorable outcomes. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of this type of surgery in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.As part of a larger prospective multicenter study, the direct costs of medical treatment for 70 patients undergoing surgery for CSM at a single institution in Canada were retrospectively obtained from the hospital expenses database and physician reimbursement data. Utilities were estimated on the entire sample of 278 subjects enrolled in the multicenter study using SF-6D-derived utilities from 12- and 24-month SF-36v2 follow-up information. Costs were analyzed from the payer perspective. A 10-year horizon with 3% discounting was applied to health-utilities estimates. Sensitivity analysis was performed by varying utility gain by 20%.The SF-6D utility gain was 0.0734 (95% CI 0.0557-0.0912, p < 0.01) at 12 months and remained unchanged at 24 months. The 10-year discounted QALY gain was 0.64. Direct costs of medical treatment were estimated at an average of CaD $21,066. The estimated cost-utility ratio was CaD $32,916 per QALY gained. The sensitivity analysis showed a range of CaD $27,326-$40,988 per QALY gained. These estimates are within the limits for medical procedures that have an acceptable cost-utility ratio.Surgical treatment for CSM is associated with significant improvement in health utilities as measured by the SF-6D. The direct cost of medical treatment per QALY gained places this form of treatment within the category deemed by payers to be cost-effective.",2012-01-09768,22985375,J Neurosurg Spine,Michael G Fehlings,2012,17 / 1Suppl,89-93,No,22985375,"Michael G Fehlings; Neilank K Jha; Stephanie M Hewson; Eric M Massicotte; Branko Kopjar; Sukhvinder Kalsi-Ryan; Is surgery for cervical spondylotic myelopathy cost-effective?

10271,The cost-effectiveness of TNF-inhibitors for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Swedish clinical practice,"OBJECTIVE: The objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of TNF-inhibitors for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Swedish clinical practice, both as a first and second biological treatment, with or without the combination of conventional DMARDs. Further sub-group analysis of etanercept treatment was performed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patient level data were obtained from three regions of the Swedish Rheumatology Registers. The dataset contained 2,558 patients who had started TNF-inhibitor treatment, 1,049 with etanercept as their first biological treatment. A total of 819 patients had switched to a second TNF-inhibitor, of which 425 to etanercept. A Markov cohort model was used in which health states of disease severity were classified according to HAQ and DAS28. Disease progression and discontinuation rates of TNF-inhibitors were based on the registry and for the comparator on published literature. Mortality, costs and utilities were based on Swedish data. The main analysis had a societal perspective over 20 years and efficacy was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: TNF-inhibitor treatment was associated with an increase in QALYs and an incremental cost compared to no biological treatment.

10281,Cost-effectiveness of apixaban vs warfarin for secondary stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,"To compare the cost-effectiveness of apixaban vs warfarin for secondary stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).Using standard methods, we created a Markov decision model based on the estimated cost of apixaban and data from the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial and other trials of warfarin therapy for AF. We quantified the cost and quality-adjusted life expectancy resulting from apixaban 5 mg twice daily compared with those from warfarin therapy targeted to an international normalized ratio of 2-3. Our base case population was a cohort of 70-year-old patients with no contraindication to anticoagulation and a history of stroke or TIA from nonvalvular AF.Warfarin therapy resulted in a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 3.91 years at a cost of $378,500. In comparison, treatment with apixaban led to a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 4.19 years at a cost of $381,700. Therefore, apixaban provided a gain of 0.28 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an additional cost of $3,200, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $11,400 per QALY. Our findings were robust in univariate sensitivity analyses varying model inputs across plausible ranges. In Monte Carlo analysis, apixaban was cost-effective in 62% of simulations using a threshold of $50,000 per QALY and 81% of simulations using a threshold of $100,000 per QALY.Apixaban appears to be cost-effective relative to warfarin for secondary stroke prevention in patients with AF, assuming that it is introduced at a price similar to that of dabigatran.",2012-01-09779,22993279,Neurology,Hooman Kamel,2012,79 / 14,1428-34,No,22993279,"Hooman Kamel; J Donald Easton; S Claiborne Johnston; Anthony S Kim; Cost-effectiveness of apixaban vs warfarin for secondary stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, Neurology, Oct/2/2012; 79(14):1526-632X; 1428-34",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban (5 mg twice daily) vs. Adjusted-dose warfarin with goal of international normalized ratio (INR) of 2-3,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,11400,United States,2010,13530.68
10282,Shortened peginterferon and ribavirin treatment for chronic hepatitis C,"Background: Peginterferon alfa and ribavirin combination therapy is an effective treatment for many patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). Reducing the length of treatment may be advantageous. We performed a systematic review and economic evaluation to assess shorter treatment duration of this regimen. Methods: We searched fourteen bibliographic databases (including The Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase) from 2000 to October 2009 and consulted experts and drug manufacturers. Eligible articles were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) selected according to predefined criteria. We undertook an economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of shortened treatment versus standard treatment in the UK. Results: Six trials were included. In the sub-group of patients who had low viral load (LVL) and a rapid virological response (RVR), there were no statistically significant differences in sustained virological response (SVR) rates between patients who received standard treatment (range, 83 percent to 100 percent) and those who received shortened courses (range 84 percent to 96 percent) (24 weeks for genotype 1, 16 weeks for genotype 2/3). Shortened treatment resulted in cost savings, but in some scenarios also resulted in poorer outcome, compared with standard treatment. This requires a judgment to be made on the value of the quality-adjusted life-year loss resulting from adopting a shorter treatment regimen, if shorter treatment is associated with a lower SVR than standard treatment duration.

Reducing the length of treatment may be advantageous. We performed a systematic review and economic evaluation to assess shorter treatment duration of this regimen. Methods: We searched fourteen bibliographic databases (including The Cochrane Library, Medline, and Embase) from 2000 to October 2009 and consulted experts and drug manufacturers. Eligible articles were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) selected according to predefined criteria. We undertook an economic evaluation to assess the cost-effectiveness of shortened treatment versus standard treatment in the UK. Results: Six trials were included. In the sub-group of patients who had low viral load (LVL) and a rapid virological response (RVR), there were no statistically significant differences in sustained virological response (SVR) rates between patients who received standard treatment (range, 83 percent to 100 percent) and those who received shortened courses (range 84 percent to 96 percent) (24 weeks for genotype 1, 16 weeks for genotype 2/3). Shortened treatment resulted in cost savings, but in some scenarios also resulted in poorer outcome, compared with standard treatment. This requires a judgment to be made on the value of the quality-adjusted life-year loss resulting from adopting a shorter treatment regimen, if shorter treatment is associated with a lower SVR than standard treatment duration.

10287,An economic model of school-based behavioral interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections,"Objectives: Reducing sexually transmitted infections (STI) and teenage pregnancy through effective health education is a high priority for health policy. Behavioral interventions which teach skills to practice safer sex may reduce the incidence of STIs. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of school-based behavioral interventions in young people. Methods: We developed an economic model to estimate the total number of STI cases averted, consequent gain in health related quality of life (HRQoL) and savings in medical costs, based on changes in sexual behavior. The parameters for the model were derived from a systematic literature search on the intervention effectiveness, epidemiology of STIs, sexual behavior and lifestyles, HRQoL and health service costs. Results: The costs of providing teacher-led and peer-led behavioral interventions were ?5.16 and ?18 per pupil, respectively. For a cohort of 1000 boys and 1000 girls aged 15 years, the model estimated that the behavioral interventions would avert two STI cases and save 0.35 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Compared to standard education, the incremental cost-effectiveness of the teacher-led and peer-led interventions was ?24,268 and ?96,938 per QALY gained, respectively. Conclusions: School-based behavioral interventions which provide information and teach young people sexual health skills can bring about improvements in knowledge and increased self-efficacy, though these may be limited in terms of impact on sexual behavior.

10299,Development of a decision-analytic model for the application of STR-based provenance testing of transrectal prostate biopsy specimens,"The diagnostic algorithm for most cancers includes the assessment of a tissue specimen by a surgical pathologist, but if specimen provenance is uncertain, the diagnostic and therapeutic process carries significant risk to the patient. Over the last decade, short tandem repeat (STR) analysis has emerged as a DNA-based method with clinical applicability for specimen identity testing (also known as specimen provenance testing). Although the clinical utility of identity testing using STR-based analysis has been demonstrated in many studies, its economic value has not been established.We developed a decision-analytic model of the application of STR-based provenance testing of transrectal prostate biopsy specimens obtained as part of routine clinical care to rule out the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, as compared with no STR-based testing. Using parameter values drawn from the published literature, the cost-effectiveness of STR-based testing was quantified by calculating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year gained.In comparison to the current standard practice of no identity testing, identity testing by STR-based analysis has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $65,570 per quality-adjusted life-year gained at a testing cost of $618 per person. At a cost of $515 per person, identity testing would meet the conservative standard of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. At a test cost of $290 per person, identity testing would be cost saving.Given the rapidly declining pricing of STR-based identity testing, it is likely that testing to confirm the identity of positive prostate biopsy samples will be a cost-effective method for preventing treatment errors stemming from misidentification. Studies to formally establish the frequency of specimen provenance errors in routine clinical practice would therefore seem justified.",2012-01-09788,22999136,Value Health,John D Pfeifer,2012,15 / 6,860-7,Yes,22999136,"John D Pfeifer; Michael N Singleton; Martin H Gregory; Dennis L Lambert; Steven M Kymes; Development of a decision-analytic model for the application of STR-based provenance testing of transrectal prostate biopsy specimens, Value Health, ; 15(6):1098-3015; 860-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Short-tandem repeat-based provenance testing of transrectal prostate biopsy specimens to rule out the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,65570,United States,2009,79101.68
10300,Cost-effectiveness of truncated therapy for hepatitis C based on rapid virologic response,"Shortened courses of treatment with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin for patients with hepatitis C virus infection who experience rapid virologic response can be effective in appropriately selected patients. The cost-effectiveness of truncated therapy is not known.To assess the cost-effectiveness of response-guided therapy versus standard-duration therapy on the basis of best available evidence.We developed a decision model for chronic hepatitis C virus infection representing two treatment strategies: 1) standard-duration therapy with pegylated interferon alfa and ribavirin for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1 or 4 and for 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 or 3 and 2) truncated therapy (i.e., 50% decrease in treatment duration) in patients with rapid virologic response. Patients for whom truncated therapy failed began standard-duration therapy guided by genotype. We used a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years.In the base-case analysis, mean lifetime costs were $46,623 ? $2,483 with standard-duration therapy and $42,354 ? $2,489 with truncated therapy. Mean lifetime quality-adjusted life-years were similar between the groups (17.1 ? 0.7 with standard therapy; 17.2 ? 0.7 with truncated therapy). Across model simulations, the probability of truncated therapy being economically dominant (i.e., both cost saving and more effective) was 78.6%. The results were consistent when we stratified the data by genotype. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the results were sensitive only to changes in treatment efficacy.Truncated therapy based on rapid virologic response is likely to be cost saving for treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Cost-effectiveness varied with small changes in relative treatment efficacy.",2012-01-09789,22999138,Value Health,Ziad F Gellad,2012,15 / 6,876-86,Yes,22999138,"Ziad F Gellad; Andrew J Muir; John G McHutchison; William Sievert; Ala I Sharara; Kimberly A Brown; Robert Flisiak; Ira M Jacobson; David Kershenobich; Michael P Manns; Kevin A Schulman; Shelby D Reed; Cost-effectiveness of truncated therapy for hepatitis C based on rapid virologic response, Value Health, ; 15(6):1098-3015; 876-86",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Response-guided/truncated therapy: varied on basis of genotype, baseline viral load for genotype 1, and presence of rapid viorlogic response at week 4 vs. Standard duration arm: ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa for 24 or 48 weeks",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-85380,United States,2010,-101337.65
