23101,The cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle intervention in the treatment of obesity,"BACKGROUND: The Food and Drug Administration has approved several pharmacotherapies for the treatment of obesity. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of six pharmacotherapies and lifestyle intervention for people with mild obesity (body mass indices [BMIs] 30 to 35). METHODS: A microsimulation model was constructed to compare seven weight loss strategies plus no treatment: intensive lifestyle intervention, orlistat, phentermine, phentermine/topiramate, lorcaserin, liraglutide, and semaglutide. Weight loss, quality-of-life scores, and costs were estimated using clinical trials and other published literature. Endpoints included costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000/QALY. Results were analysed at 1-, 3-, and 5-year time horizons. RESULTS: At each of the three follow-up periods, phentermine was the cost-effective strategy, with ICERs of $46 258/QALY, $20 157/QALY, and $17 880/QALY after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Semaglutide was the most effective strategy in the 3- and 5-year time horizons, with total QALYs of 2.224 and 3.711, respectively. However, the ICERs were prohibitively high at $1 437 340/QALY after 3 years and $576 931/QALY after 5 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated these results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Phentermine is the cost-effective pharmacologic weight-loss strategy.

23105,Anti-reflux Surgery Versus Proton Pump Inhibitors for Severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: A Cost-Effectiveness Study in Korea,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: The economic burden for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) has recently increased in Asian countries. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness between anti-reflux surgery and medication, with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for GERD in Korea. METHODS: We used a decision tree and Markov model to obtain the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of the surgical and medical strategies. Our target cohort was the severe GERD patients aged 50 years old who required a continuous double dose of PPIs. The time horizon was 10 years and all estimates were discounted at 5% per year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the anti-reflux surgery compared with medication with PPIs was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all relevant variables. RESULTS: The cost-utility analysis indicated anti-reflux surgery was more cost-effective than medication among severe GERD patients over a 10-year period. The model predicted that the surgical strategy had a cost savings of $551 and the QALYs had a gain of 1.18 as compared with the medical strategy. The break-even point in costs of the anti-reflux surgery over the medication was estimated to be 9 years. Sensitivity analyses using the varying parameter assumptions demonstrated the robustness of the study results. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed anti-reflux surgery was less expensive and more effective therapy over the PPI medication after 9 years of follow-up. This suggests the surgical strategy is a cost-effective alternative to PPI medication among patients who need long-term management for GERD in Korea.",2020-01-32735,32235028,J Neurogastroenterol Motil,Susan Park,2020,26 / 2,215-223,No,32235028,"Susan Park; Sungsoo Park; Joong-Min Park; Soorack Ryu; Jinseub Hwang; Jin-Won Kwon; Kyung Won Seo; Anti-reflux Surgery Versus Proton Pump Inhibitors for Severe Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease: A Cost-Effectiveness Study in Korea, J Neurogastroenterol Motil , 2020 Apr 30; 26(2):2093-0887; 215-223",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Surgical",anti-reflux surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- Proton pump inhibitors,severe gastroesophageal reflux disease,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,-466.95,United States,2018,-481.28
23106,Model-Based Biomarker Selection for Dose Individualization of Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors,"Tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) demonstrate high inter-individual variability with respect to safety and efficacy and would therefore benefit from dose or schedule adjustments. This study investigated the efficacy, safety, and economical aspects of alternative dosing options for sunitinib in gastro-intestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and axitinib in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Dose individualization based on drug concentration, adverse effects, and sVEGFR-3 was explored using a modeling framework connecting pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models, as well as overall survival. Model-based simulations were performed to investigate four different scenarios: (I) the predicted value of high-dose pulsatile schedules to improve clinical outcomes as compared to regular daily dosing, (II) the potential of biomarkers for dose individualizations, such as drug concentrations, toxicity measurements, and the biomarker sVEGFR-3, (III) the cost-effectiveness of biomarker-guided dose-individualizations, and (IV) model-based dosing approaches versus standard sample-based methods to guide dose adjustments in clinical practice. Simulations from the axitinib and sunitinib frameworks suggest that weekly or once every two weeks high-dosing result in lower overall survival in patients with mRCC and GIST, compared to continuous daily dosing. Moreover, sVEGFR-3 appears a safe and cost-effective biomarker to guide dose adjustments and improve overall survival (€36 784.- per QALY). Model-based estimations were for biomarkers in general found to correctly predict dose adjustments similar to or more accurately than single clinical measurements and might therefore guide dose adjustments.

23109,Omalizumab for Severe Allergic Asthma Treatment in Italy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis from PROXIMA Study,"INTRODUCTION: Inadequately controlled severe asthma patients require additional therapy accounting for significant clinical and economic burden. Our analysis aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of omalizumab in the management of severe allergic asthma in Italy based on observational data from the PROXIMA study. METHODS: Observational data on efficacy, healthcare resource utilization and changes in quality of life at 12 months after the initiation of omalizumab were examined to estimate the cost-effectiveness compared to pre-omalizumab period and results were expressed with Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). The cost-utility analysis estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Direct health costs were assessed from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). RESULTS: Omalizumab reduced the incidence of exacerbations, number of hospitalizations, physician visits, and improved quality of life after 12 months of treatment. Omalizumab had a greater effectiveness than pre-omalizumab treatment involving 0.132 QALYs gained and led to a €3729 per patient reduction in direct healthcare costs, excluding the add-on treatment cost. Nevertheless, the addition of omalizumab cost led to €7478 increase in total direct costs with respect to pre-omalizumab period. Based on difference in total direct cost and difference in QALY between post and pre-omalizumab period, the ICER was €56,847. According to sensitivity analysis, omalizumab provided a cost-effective use of NHS resources, already at 20% discounted price. CONCLUSION: This study offers a real-world evidence of omalizumab effectiveness in Italy.

The main objective of this paper is to examine the cost-utility of ABCT compared to REL in terms of effects on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as well as healthcare costs. Forty-two Spanish patients with FM received 8 weekly group sessions of ABCT or REL. Data collection took place at pre- and 3-month follow-up. Cost-utility of the two treatment groups (ABCT vs. REL) was compared by examining treatment outcomes in terms of QALYs (obtained with the EQ-5D-3L) and healthcare costs (data about service use obtained with the Client Service Receipt Inventory). Data analyses were computed from a completers, ITT, and per protocol approach. Data analysis from the healthcare perspective revealed that those patients receiving ABCT exhibited larger improvements in quality of life than those doing relaxation, while being less costly 3 months after their 8-week treatment program had ended (completers: incremental cost M, 95% CI = €-194.1 (-450.3 to 356.1); incremental effect M, 95% CI = 0.023 QALYs (0.010 to 0.141)).

However, trials have demonstrated promising antitumor activity for targeted therapies/immunotherapies among chemorefractory metastatic GC patients. Pembrolizumab has shown particular efficacy among patients with programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of biomarker-guided second-line GC treatment. METHODS: We constructed a Markov decision-analytic model using clinical trial data. Our model compared pembrolizumab monotherapy and ramucirumab/paclitaxel combination therapy for all patients and pembrolizumab for patients based on MSI status or PD-L1 expression. Paclitaxel monotherapy and best supportive care for all patients were additional comparators. Costs of drugs, treatment administration, follow-up, and management of adverse events were estimated from a US payer perspective. The primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY over 60 months. Secondary outcomes were unadjusted life years (survival) and costs. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model uncertainty.

23120,Cost-Effectiveness of MRI-Based Identification of Presymptomatic Autism in a High-Risk Population,"Biological siblings of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have increased risk of receiving an ASD diagnosis. In the U.S., most children with ASD are diagnosed after the optimal age to initiate early intervention which can reduce symptom severity and improve outcomes. Recent evidence suggests magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the first year of life can predict later diagnostic status in high-risk siblings. We investigated whether MRI-based screening is a cost-effective method for assigning early intervention. A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was used to evaluate two MRI-based screening strategies at 6 and 12 months of age. Primary outcomes were costs in U.S. dollars and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Costs were estimated from societal, health care, and educational perspectives. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. From a societal perspective, the ICER for MRI-based screening at 6 months was $49,000 per QALY when compared to the status quo, implying that such screening is cost-effective at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50,000-$100,000 per QALY. From the health care and educational perspectives, the ICERs were larger at $99,000 and $76,000 per QALY, respectively. Sensitivity analysis identified that the parameters most influential in affecting cost-effectiveness were the prevalence of ASD and/or co-occurring intellectual disability.

23123,A Cost-Effectiveness and Quality of Life Analysis of Different Approaches to the Management and Treatment of Localized Prostate Cancer,"The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of active monitoring (AM), radical prostatectomy (PR), and external-beam radiotherapy with neoadjuvant hormone therapy (RT) for localized prostate cancer. Microsimulations of radical prostatectomy, 3D-conformal radiotherapy, or active monitoring were performed using Medicare reimbursement schedules and clinical trial results for a target population of men aged 50-69 years with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer (T1-T2, NX, M0) over a time horizon of 10 years. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were assessed and sensitivity analyses performed. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that the mean cost for AM, PR, and RT were $15,654, $18,791, and $30,378, respectively, and QALYs were 6.96, 7.44, and 7.9 years, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $6,548 for PR over AM and $68,339 for RT over PR. Results were sensitive to the number of years of follow-up and procedure cost. With relaxed assumptions for AM, the ICER of PR and RT met the societal willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY. Compared with AM, PR was highly cost-effective.

Microsimulations of radical prostatectomy, 3D-conformal radiotherapy, or active monitoring were performed using Medicare reimbursement schedules and clinical trial results for a target population of men aged 50-69 years with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer (T1-T2, NX, M0) over a time horizon of 10 years. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were assessed and sensitivity analyses performed. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that the mean cost for AM, PR, and RT were $15,654, $18,791, and $30,378, respectively, and QALYs were 6.96, 7.44, and 7.9 years, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $6,548 for PR over AM and $68,339 for RT over PR. Results were sensitive to the number of years of follow-up and procedure cost. With relaxed assumptions for AM, the ICER of PR and RT met the societal willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY. Compared with AM, PR was highly cost-effective. RT and PR for localized prostate cancer can be cost-effective, but RT must offer increased QALYs or decreased procedural costs to be cost-effective compared to PR.

23125,"Self-Monitoring and Management of Blood Pressure in Patients with Stroke or TIA: An Economic Evaluation of TEST-BP, A Randomised Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND: Prevention of secondary stroke following initial ictus is an important focus of after-stroke care. Blood pressure (BP) is a key risk factor, so usual care following stroke or transient ischaemic attack includes regular BP checks and monitoring of anti-hypertensive medication. This is traditionally carried out in primary care, but the evidence supporting self-monitoring and self-guided management of BP in the general population with hypertension is growing. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of treatment as usual (TAU) versus (1) self-monitoring of BP (S-MON) and (2) self-monitoring and guided self-management of anti-hypertensive medication (S-MAN). METHODS: This was a within-trial economic evaluation of a randomised controlled trial estimating the incremental cost per 1 mmHg BP reduction and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a 6-month time horizon from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). RESULTS: Data were evaluable for 140 participants. Costs per patient were £473, £853 and £1035; mean reduction in systolic BP (SBP) was 3.6, 6.7 and 6.1 mmHg, and QALYs accrued were 0.427, 0.422 and 0.423 for TAU, S-MON and S-MAN, respectively. No statistically significant differences in incremental costs or outcomes were detected. On average, S-MAN was dominated or extended dominated. The incremental cost per 1 mmHg BP reduction from S-MON versus TAU was £137. CONCLUSION: On average, S-MAN is an inefficient intervention.

23127,HSP27 Expression as a Novel Predictive Biomarker for Bevacizumab: is it Cost Effective?,"BACKGROUND: Despite the extensive use of bevacizumab in a range of oncology indications, the US FDA revoked its approval for breast cancers, and multiple negative trials in several solid malignancies have been reported, so the need for predictive biomarkers has increased. The development of predictive biomarkers for anti-angiogenic bevacizumab therapy has long been pursued but without success. INTRODUCTION: Heat shock protein (HSP)-27 expression has recently been identified as a predictive biomarker for bevacizumab in treating metastatic melanoma. This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of HSP27 biomarker testing before administration of bevacizumab. METHODS: A partitioned survival analysis model with three mutually exclusive health states (progression-free survival, progressed disease, and death) was developed using a Norwegian health system perspective. The proportion of patients in each state was calculated using the area under the Kaplan-Meier curve for progression-free and overall survival derived from trials of bevacizumab and dacarbazine. Three strategies were compared: (1) test-treat with HSP27 biomarker and bevacizumab, (2) treat-all with dacarbazine without HSP27 testing, (3) treat-all with bevacizumab without HSP27 testing. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs were calculated for each strategy and discounted at 4%. A lifetime horizon was applied. Uncertainty analyses were performed. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was estimated to assess the potential value of further research to generate more evidence. RESULTS: Although the test-treat strategy was cost effective compared with treat-all with dacarbazine, it was not cost effective compared with treat-all with bevacizumab without HSP27 testing. However, EVPI results showed very minimal or no value in conducting further research efforts to reduce uncertainties around current information. CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that testing for HSP27 expression before administering bevacizumab is not cost effective compared with treat-all with bevacizumab without testing. It indicates that HSP27 expression is not cost effective as a potential predictive biomarker for bevacizumab. This may not necessarily mean that HSP27 is a bad biomarker for bevacizumab, but it may mean that bevacizumab is much better than dacarbazine regardless of HSP27 expression, so patient stratification according to HSP27 status is meaningless.

23129,DyeVert™ PLUS EZ System for Preventing Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Diagnostic Coronary Angiography and/or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A UK-Based Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a complication commonly associated with invasive angiographic procedures and is considered the leading cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury. CI-AKI can lead to a prolonged hospital stay, with a substantial economic impact, and increased mortality. The DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system (FDA approved and CE marked) is a device that has been developed to divert a portion of the theoretical injected contrast media volume (CMV), reducing the overall volume of contrast media injected and aortic reflux, and potentially improving long-term health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To assess the long-term costs and health outcomes associated with the introduction of the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system into the UK health care service for the prevention of CI-AKI in a cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-4 undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography (DAG) and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and to compare these costs and outcomes with those of the current practice. METHODS: A de novo economic model was developed based on the current pathway of managing patients undergoing DAG and/or PCI and on evidence related to the clinical effectiveness of DyeVert™ in terms of its impact on relevant clinical outcomes and health service resource use. Clinical data used to populate the model were derived from the literature or were based on assumptions informed by expert clinical input. Costs included in the model were from the NHS and personal social services perspective and obtained from the literature and UK-based routine sources. Probabilistic distributions were assigned to the majority of model parameters so that a probabilistic analysis could be undertaken, while deterministic sensitivity analyses were also carried out to explore the impact of key parameter variation on the model results. RESULTS: Base-case results indicate that the intervention leads to cost savings (- £435) and improved effectiveness (+ 0.028 QALYs) over the patient''s lifetime compared with current practice. Output from the probabilistic analysis points to a high likelihood of the intervention being cost-effective across presented willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. The overall long-term cost saving for the NHS associated with the introduction of the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system is over £19.7 million for each annual cohort of patients. The cost savings are mainly driven by a lower risk of subsequent diseases and their associated costs. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the DyeVert™ PLUS EZ system has the potential to reduce costs for the health care service and yield improved clinical outcomes for patients with CKD stage 3-4 undergoing angiographic procedures.",2020-01-32755,31989464,Pharmacoeconom Open,Mehdi Javanbakht,2020,4 / 3,459-472,No,31989464,"Mehdi Javanbakht; Mohsen Rezaei Hemami; Atefeh Mashayekhi; Michael Branagan-Harris; Azfar Zaman; Yahya Al-Najjar; Donal O'Donoghue; Farzin Fath-Ordoubadi; Stephen Wheatcroft; DyeVert™ PLUS EZ System for Preventing Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Diagnostic Coronary Angiography and/or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A UK-Based Cost-Utility Analysis, Pharmacoeconom Open, 2020 Sep; 4(3):2509-4262; 459-472",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Medical Device,dyevert + ez system vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard/usual care,chronic kidney disease stage 3–4; undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography and/or percutaneous coronary intervention,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-16000,United Kingdom,2018,-22035.97
23130,Estimating the Clinical and Economic Impact of Switching from the 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13) to the 10-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV10) in Italy,"Background: Invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal diseases are significant health and economic burdens, especially in children and the elderly. Italy included the 7-valent (PCV7) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in the National Immunization Program in 2007 and 2010, respectively, allowing a dramatic reduction in the burden of pneumococcal disease. In the era of budget constraints, decision-makers may consider switching from the higher-valent, more costly PCV13, to the lower-cost PCV10. This study estimated the potential public health and economic impact of changing vaccine programs from PCV13 to PCV10 in Italy. Methods: A decision-analytic forecasting model estimated the impact of PCV programs. Real-world surveillance data were used to forecast serotype distribution and disease incidence among children and the elderly over a specified 5-year time horizon. Costs and outcomes included estimates of cases and deaths avoided, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and total costs from a payer perspective, discounted at an assumed rate of 3.0%, and robustness validated through several scenarios and sensitivity analyses. Results: A switch from PCV13 to PCV10 would increase invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases by 59.3% (4317 cases) over a 5-year horizon, primarily due to serotypes 3 and 19A. Pneumonia increased by 8.3% and acute otitis media (AOM) by 96.1%. Maintaining a PCV13 program would prevent a total incremental 531,435 disease cases (1.02M over a 10-year time horizon) and 641 deaths due to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), with €23,642 per QALY gained over 5 years versus PCV10. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that a PCV13-based program remained cost-effective in 99.7% of the simulations in Italy as parameters varied within their plausible range; percent vaccinated had the most impact. Conclusions: Maintaining the PCV13 strategy would provide substantial public health and economic benefits in Italy and is cost-effective. Switching from PCV13 to PCV10 would increase the incidence of pneumococcal disease primarily linked to re-emergence of serotypes 3 and 19A.",2020-01-32756,31979079,Pathogens,Filippo Ansaldi,2020,9 / 2,,No,31979079,"Filippo Ansaldi; Sarah Pugh; Daniela Amicizia; Roberto Di Virgilio; Cecilia Trucchi; Andrea Orsi; Alessandro Zollo; Giancarlo Icardi; Estimating the Clinical and Economic Impact of Switching from the 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV13) to the 10-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV10) in Italy, Pathogens, 2020 Jan 22; 9(2):2076-0817",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Immunization,13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine vs. 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 10",3.00,3.00,28963,Euro,2018,35275.48

23133,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nintedanib Versus Pirfenidone in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in Belgium,"BACKGROUND: Nintedanib (Ofev(®)) and pirfenidone (Esbriet(®)) are recommended by international guidelines as treatment options for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of nintedanib with that of pirfenidone for the treatment of IPF from a Belgian healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: The economic analysis used a Markov model that calculated outcomes over patient lifetime. Overall survival was assumed to be the same for the two comparators. Data from a network meta-analysis were used for loss of lung function, acute exacerbation events, safety and treatment discontinuation (for any reason). The health-state utility estimates in the model were calculated from EQ-5D scores collected in nintedanib studies. The assumed resource use for background care was also based on patient-level data that were categorised to fit the health states in the model and synthesised with costs and tariffs from Belgian national databases. RESULTS: Treatment with nintedanib resulted in an estimated total cost of €102,315, which was less than the total cost of treatment with pirfenidone (€113,313). Given the similarities in the survival and progression outcomes obtained with nintedanib and pirfenidone, the model predicted near equivalence in total QALYs (3.353 QALYs for the nintedanib arm and 3.318 for the pirfenidone arm). Results were largely driven by model assumptions underlying mortality, acute exacerbations and treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: After performing a synthesis of the most recently published evidence for IPF patients and assuming a Belgian healthcare payer perspective, we found nintedanib to be more cost-saving than pirfenidone.",2020-01-32759,31939146,Pharmacoeconom Open,C Rinciog,2020,4 / 3,449-458,No,31939146,"C Rinciog; A Diamantopoulos; A Gentilini; B Bondue; C Dahlqvist; A Froidure; W A Wuyts; S Soulard; Nicola McMeekin; Claudia Geue; Andrew Briggs; Ines Rombach; Ho Kwong Li; Philip Bejon; Martin McNally; Bridget L Atkins; Jamie Ferguson; Matthew Scarborough; OVIVA collaborators; Hui Wang; Mengyang Wang; Jiao Wang; Hongwei Liu; Rui Lu; Tongqing Duan; Xiaowen Gong; Siyuan Feng; Zhuang Cui; Yuanyuan Liu; Changping Li; Jun Ma; Moses J E Flash; Wendy H Garland; Emily B Martey; Bruce R Schackman; Sona Oksuzyan; Justine A Scott; Philip J Jeng; Marisol Rubio; Elena Losina; Kenneth A Freedberg; Sonali P Kulkarni; Emily P Hyle; Arun Jose; Mark H Eckman; Jean M Elwing; Chia-Te Liao; Mei-Chuan Lee; Zhih-Cherng Chen; Li-Jung Elizabeth Ku; Jung-Der Wang; Han Siong Toh; Kota Nagai; Kazuki Ide; Yohei Kawasaki; Sachiko Tanaka-Mizuno; Kahori Seto; Shinji Iwane; Yuichiro Eguchi; Koji Kawakami; Zhaoyan Chen; Mei Zhan; Fangyuan Tian; Ting Xu; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nintedanib Versus Pirfenidone in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis in Belgium, Pharmacoeconom Open, 2020 Sep; 4(3):2509-4262; 449-458",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,nintedanib vs. Pirfenidone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,1.50,-314228.57,Euro,2018,-382714.61
23134,Cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions to improve osteoporosis care in France,"Summary: Osteoporosis (OP) is responsible for an important economic burden, but OP care is far from meeting therapeutic guidelines. Some interventions were effective to improve OP management. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Structural interventions and interventions consisting in sending educational material were dominant strategies. Purpose: Osteoporosis (OP) causes many osteoporotic fractures worldwide and an important economic burden as a result. OP care is far from meeting treatment guidelines, but in a recent meta-analysis, we showed that some interventions were effective to improve appropriate bone mineral density (BMD) and treatment prescriptions. In the context of limited resources, it is of major importance to measure these interventions’ efficiency. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of existing effective intervention types. Methods: We used a decision tree incorporating Markov models to compare costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs) between usual care and three intervention types: structural (I), direct educational through conversation (II), and indirect educational by sending material (III). We adopted the collectivity perspective and chose a 30-year time horizon. The model included efficacy of interventions and risk of further fracture or death, depending on BMD T-score results and OP management, obtained from published literature. The model was populated to reflect a French setting. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Costs were presented in 2018 euros (€).

23135,Cost-effectiveness analyses of interventions to improve osteoporosis care in France,"Summary: Osteoporosis (OP) is responsible for an important economic burden, but OP care is far from meeting therapeutic guidelines. Some interventions were effective to improve OP management. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. Structural interventions and interventions consisting in sending educational material were dominant strategies. Purpose: Osteoporosis (OP) causes many osteoporotic fractures worldwide and an important economic burden as a result. OP care is far from meeting treatment guidelines, but in a recent meta-analysis, we showed that some interventions were effective to improve appropriate bone mineral density (BMD) and treatment prescriptions. In the context of limited resources, it is of major importance to measure these interventions’ efficiency. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of existing effective intervention types. Methods: We used a decision tree incorporating Markov models to compare costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs) between usual care and three intervention types: structural (I), direct educational through conversation (II), and indirect educational by sending material (III). We adopted the collectivity perspective and chose a 30-year time horizon. The model included efficacy of interventions and risk of further fracture or death, depending on BMD T-score results and OP management, obtained from published literature. The model was populated to reflect a French setting. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Costs were presented in 2018 euros (€).

23137,The cost-effectiveness of as-needed budesonide/formoterol versus low-dose inhaled corticosteroid maintenance therapy in patients with mild asthma in the UK,"Background: As-needed budesonide/formoterol is effective in patients with mild asthma for whom low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) maintenance therapy is appropriate. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of this regimen versus maintenance low-dose ICS plus as-needed short-acting ß2-agonist (SABA). Methods: A probabilistic Markov cohort model was developed that simulated time within/outside severe asthma exacerbations, conducted from a UK NHS perspective with a 70-year time horizon. Clinical efficacy inputs were derived from the SYGMA 2 trial. Patients with mild asthma eligible for low-dose maintenance ICS therapy received as-needed budesonide/formoterol 200/6 µg or twice-daily budesonide 200 µg maintenance therapy plus as-needed terbutaline 0.5 mg. A severe exacerbation was defined as worsening asthma requiring systemic corticosteroid use alone/in combination with an emergency department visit, or hospitalisation for acute asthma. Utility values were derived from SYGMA 2 EQ-5D-5L data, and all-cause- and asthma-related mortality, reduction in utility of an exacerbation, and costs were based on published data. The base-case analysis discount rate was 3.5%. Model robustness was evaluated with one-way sensitivity, probabilistic sensitivity, and two scenario analyses. Results: On average, as-needed budesonide/formoterol was associated with a £292.99 cost saving and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains of 0.001 versus ICS + SABA. At a willingness-to-pay of £20,000/QALY, as-needed budesonide/formoterol had >85% probability of being cost-effective versus ICS + SABA. Key drivers were budesonide/formoterol and budesonide maintenance annual exacerbation rates, mean daily budesonide/formoterol inhalations, and costs and outcomes discount rates. Conclusions: From a UK healthcare payer perspective, as-needed budesonide/formoterol is a cost-effective option for the treatment of mild asthma versus regular ICS. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020-01-32771,0,Respir.

23138,Cost-Utility Analysis of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Versus Antidepressant Pharmacotherapy for Prevention of Depressive Relapse in a Canadian Context: Analyse coût-utilité de la thérapie cognitive basée sur la pleine conscience contre la pharmacothérapie antidépressive pour prévenir la r,"Objective: Patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD) experience impaired functioning and reduced quality of life, including an elevated risk of episode return. MDD is associated with high societal burden due to increased healthcare utilization, productivity losses, and suicide-related costs, making the long-term management of this illness a priority. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), a first-line preventative psychological treatment, compared to maintenance antidepressant medication (ADM), the current standard of care. Method: A cost–utility analysis was conducted over a 24-month time horizon to model differences between MBCT and ADM in cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The analysis was conducted using a decision tree analytic model. Intervention efficacy, utility, and costing data estimates were derived from published sources and expert consultation. Results: MBCT was found to be cost-effective compared to maintenance ADM over a 24-month time horizon. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy resulted in 1.10 QALY and $17,255.37 per patient on average, whereas MBCT resulted in 1.18 QALY and $15,030.70 per patient on average. This resulted in a cost difference of $2,224.67 and a QALY difference of 0.08, in favor of MBCT. Multiple sensitivity analyses supported these findings. Conclusions: From both a societal and health system perspective, utilizing MBCT as a first-line relapse prevention treatment is potentially cost-effective in a Canadian setting. Future economic evaluations should consider combined treatment (e.g., ADM and psychotherapy) as a comparator and longer time horizons as the literature advances. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020-01-32774,32031000,Can.

This study was powered to determine the most cost-effective strategy for patient with different combined positive score (CPS). Materials and methods: A Markov model was developed to predict progression-free survival, disease progression, or death in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC based on data from the KEYNOTE-048 trial. Cost was obtained from West China Hospital, while utilities were referred to published studies. By using Monte Carlo simulations, acceptability curves were depicted to address the uncertainty of model inputs. Results: Compared with cetuximab plus chemotherapy, pembrolizumab monotherapy resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $14,995 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) in total population and $22,779 per QALY in patients with CPS = 1. Comparing pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with standard therapy led to an ICER of $43,230 per QALY in total population and $26,157 per QALY in patients with CPS = 1. For patients with CPS = 20, ICERs yield by immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy exceeded the threshold of willingness to pay we set, when compared with standard therapy. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was dominated by pembrolizumab alone in this patient population.

This study was powered to determine the most cost-effective strategy for patient with different combined positive score (CPS). Materials and methods: A Markov model was developed to predict progression-free survival, disease progression, or death in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC based on data from the KEYNOTE-048 trial. Cost was obtained from West China Hospital, while utilities were referred to published studies. By using Monte Carlo simulations, acceptability curves were depicted to address the uncertainty of model inputs. Results: Compared with cetuximab plus chemotherapy, pembrolizumab monotherapy resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $14,995 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) in total population and $22,779 per QALY in patients with CPS = 1. Comparing pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy with standard therapy led to an ICER of $43,230 per QALY in total population and $26,157 per QALY in patients with CPS = 1. For patients with CPS = 20, ICERs yield by immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy exceeded the threshold of willingness to pay we set, when compared with standard therapy. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy was dominated by pembrolizumab alone in this patient population. Conclusion: For HNSCC patients with different CPS, pembrolizumab alone was the optimal choice for total population and patients with CPS = 1. Among patients with high CPS, immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy was not preferred over the standard therapy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020-01-32775,32428689,Oral Oncol.,K Zhou,2020,107 /,-,No,32428689,"K Zhou; Y Li; W Liao; M Zhang; L Bai; Q Li; Pembrolizumab alone or with chemotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: A cost-effectiveness analysis from Chinese perspective, Oral Oncol., 2020; 107():; -",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs. cetuximab + chemotherapy,Combined Positive Score >20,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,50100.2,United States,2019,50718.28
23148,Eradicating hepatitis C: Are novel screening strategies for people who inject drugs cost-effective?,"Background: In developed countries, people who inject drugs (PWID) have a high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV), yet they are often under-diagnosed. The World Health Organization has set 2030 as a target year for HCV elimination. To meet this target, improving screening in convenient community settings in order to reach infected undiagnosed individuals is a priority. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of alternative novel strategies for diagnosing HCV infection in PWID. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken to compare HCV screening at needle exchange centres, substance misuse services and at community pharmacies, with the standard practice of detection during general practitioners’ consultations. A decision tree model was developed to assess the incremental cost per positive diagnosis, and a Markov model explored the net monetary benefit (NMB) and the cost per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained over a lifetime horizon. Results: Needle exchange services provided a 7.45-fold increase in detecting positive individuals and an incremental cost of £12,336 per QALY gained against current practice (NMB £163,827), making this the most cost-effective strategy over a lifetime horizon. Screening at substance misuse services and pharmacies was cost-effective only at a £30,000/QALY threshold. With a 24% discount to HCV treatment list prices, all three screening strategies become cost-effective at £20,000/QALY. Conclusions: Targeting PWID populations with screening at needle exchange services is a highly cost-effective strategy for reaching undiagnosed HCV patients. When applying realistic discounts to list prices of drug treatments, all three strategies were highly cost-effective from a UK NHS perspective.

23151,Cost-effectiveness of Anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-Cell therapy in pediatric relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A societal view,"Introduction: In several studies, the chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel demonstrated encouraging rates of remission and lasting survival benefits in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel (list price: 320 000 EUR) among these patients when compared to clofarabine monotherapy (Clo-M), clofarabine combination therapy (Clo-C), and blinatumomab (Blina) from both a healthcare and a societal perspective. We also assessed future medical and future non-medical consumption costs. Methods: A three-state partitioned survival model was used to simulate a cohort of pediatric patients (12 years of age) through different disease states until the end of life (lifetime horizon). Relevant outcomes were life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, societal costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was explored through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses as well as through several scenario analyzes. Results: Total discounted costs for tisagenlecleucel were 552 679 EUR from a societal perspective, which was much higher than the total discounted costs from a healthcare perspective (ie, 409 563 EUR). Total discounted societal costs for the comparator regimens ranged between 160 803 EUR for Clo-M and 267 259 EUR for Blina. Highest QALYs were estimated for tisagenlecleucel (11.26), followed by Blina (2.25), Clo-C (1.70) and Clo-M (0.74). Discounted societal ICERs of tisagenlecleucel ranged between 31 682 EUR/QALY for Blina and 37 531 EUR/QALY for Clo-C and were considered cost-effective with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 80 000 EUR/QALY. None of the scenarios exceeded this threshold, and more than 98% of the iterations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis were cost-effective. Discussion: At the current price and WTP threshold, tisagenlecleucel is cost-effective from both a healthcare and a societal perspective. Nevertheless, long-term effectiveness data are needed to validate the several assumptions that were necessary for this model. © 2020 The Authors.

23154,Cost-effectiveness of in-home automated external defibrillators for children with cardiac conditions associated with risk of sudden cardiac death,"Background: Children at high risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) (>6% over 5 years) receive an implantable cardioverter–defibrillator (ICD), but no guidelines are available for those at lower risk. For children at intermediate risk for SCD (4%–6% over 5 years), the utility and cost-effectiveness of in-home automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are unclear. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of in-home AED for children at intermediate risk for SCD. Methods: Using hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) as the proxy disease, a theoretical cohort of 1550 ten-year-old children with HCM was followed for 69 years. Baseline annual risk of SCD was 0.8%. Outcomes were SCD, severe neurologic morbidity (SNM), cost, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Model inputs were derived from the literature, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Results: Among children at intermediate risk for SCD, in-home AED resulted in 31 fewer cases of SCD but 3 more cases of SNM. There were 319 QALYs gained. Although costs were higher by $28 million, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $86,458, which is below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Conclusion: For children at intermediate risk for SCD and HCM, in-home AED is cost-effective, resulting in fewer deaths and increased QALYS for a cost below the willingness-to-pay threshold. These findings highlight the economic benefits of in-home AED use in this population. © 2020",2020-01-32782,32234558,Heart Rhythm,B Haag,2020,17 / 8,1328-1334,No,32234558,"B Haag; R Hersh; E Toffey; A Sargent; C Stecker; B Heitner; B Caughey; S Balaji; Cost-effectiveness of in-home automated external defibrillators for children with cardiac conditions associated with risk of sudden cardiac death, Heart Rhythm, 2020; 17(8):1744-8379; 1328-1334",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Device,in-home automated external defibrillator vs. None,cardiac conditions associated with risk of sudden cardiac death,Not Stated,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,86458,United States,2019,87524.62
23155,Cost-effectiveness of a collaborative care program for managing major depression and chronic musculoskeletal pain in primary care: Economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial,"Background: We designed a collaborative care program for the integrated management of chronic musculoskeletal pain and depression, which frequently coexist in primary care patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this program compared with care as usual. Methods: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomized clinical trial. Results were monitored over a 12-month period. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We performed cost-effectiveness analyses from the perspectives of the healthcare system and society using an intention-to-treat approach with imputation of missing values. Results: We evaluated 328 patients (167 in the intervention group and 161 in the control group) with chronic musculoskeletal pain and major depression at baseline. From the healthcare system perspective, the mean incremental cost was €234 (p = .17) and the mean incremental effectiveness was 0.009 QALYs (p = .66), resulting in an ICER of €23,989/QALY. Costs from the societal perspective were €235 (p = .16), yielding an ICER of €24,102/QALY. These estimates were associated with a high degree of uncertainty illustrated on the cost-effectiveness plane. Conclusions: Contrary to our expectations, the collaborative care program had no significant effects on health status, and although the additional costs of implementing the program compared with care as usual were not high, we were unable to demonstrate a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio, largely due to the high degree of uncertainty surrounding the estimates. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",2020-01-32783,32554105,J.

23157,Durvalumab vs placebo consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: An updated PACIFIC trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis,"Introduction: Recently updated three-year survival data from the PACIFIC trial showed that durvalumab consolidation therapy improved OS rates versus placebo for patients with unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after chemoradiotherapy. Considering the impact of the high cost of durvalumab, its cost-effectiveness should be updated to see if its cost-effectiveness has changed from the US payers’ perspective. Methods: A comprehensive Markov model was used to evaluate mean lifetime costs and effectiveness of first-line durvalumab consolidation therapy versus placebo for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC imputing updated survival and quality-of-life data from the PACIFIC trial. The main endpoints include total costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to access the uncertainty in the variables. We also considered durvalumab cost-effectiveness in the subgroups. Results: Durvalumab consolidation therapy resulted in additional 1.34 LYs and 1.01 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $138,920 per QALY versus the placebo treatment. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the utility values of two treatments, body weight, and unit cost of durvalumab have the greatest influence on the result. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that durvalumab was more cost effective for patients with non-squamous-cell lung cancer, followed by 25% or greater PD-L1 expression. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of durvalumab being cost-effective versus the placebo is 62.6% at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $150,000 per QALY Conclusion: Our analyses demonstrated that receiving durvalumab consolidation therapy was more cost-effective than placebo at a WTP threshold of $150,000. These results can be of use to US practitioners in the application of durvalumab and for durvalumab prescription and reimbursement policies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020-01-32785,32512272,Lung Cancer,J Han,2020,146 /,42-49,No,32512272,"J Han; K Tian; J Yang; Y Gong; Durvalumab vs placebo consolidation therapy after chemoradiotherapy in stage III non-small-cell lung cancer: An updated PACIFIC trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis, Lung Cancer, 2020; 146():; 42-49",QALY,China,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, None / Do Nothing",durvalumab vs. Placebo,"Unresectable, Stage III, after chemoradiotherapy",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,139689,United States,2020,139689

Methods: A comprehensive Markov model was used to evaluate mean lifetime costs and effectiveness of first-line durvalumab consolidation therapy versus placebo for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC imputing updated survival and quality-of-life data from the PACIFIC trial. The main endpoints include total costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to access the uncertainty in the variables. We also considered durvalumab cost-effectiveness in the subgroups. Results: Durvalumab consolidation therapy resulted in additional 1.34 LYs and 1.01 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $138,920 per QALY versus the placebo treatment. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the utility values of two treatments, body weight, and unit cost of durvalumab have the greatest influence on the result. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that durvalumab was more cost effective for patients with non-squamous-cell lung cancer, followed by 25% or greater PD-L1 expression. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of durvalumab being cost-effective versus the placebo is 62.6% at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $150,000 per QALY Conclusion: Our analyses demonstrated that receiving durvalumab consolidation therapy was more cost-effective than placebo at a WTP threshold of $150,000.

23161,Cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary co-management program for the older hip fracture patients in Beijing,"Summary: The multidisciplinary co-management program for geriatric patients with hip fracture is cost-effective in the Chinese population and it has the potential to be scaled up in China. Introduction: The study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary co-management program for patients with hip fracture in China. Methods: Hip fracture patients who were admitted to an orthopedic hospital in Beijing were included in the multidisciplinary co-management program. The cost-effectiveness of intervention was evaluated compared to the conventional management. A Markov microsimulation model was developed to simulate lifetime costs and effectiveness. Costs including intervention, hospitalization, medications, and long-term care costs were expressed using 2019 US dollars and the healthcare perspective was adopted. Effectiveness was evaluated using both 1-year mortality-averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and effectiveness were discounted at 5% per annum. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $26,481 per QALY gained which was three times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in China. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The lifetime cost for the conventional management (n = 1839) and intervention group (n = 1192) was $11,975 and $13,309 respectively. The lifetime QALYs were 2.38 and 2.45 years and the first-year mortality was 17.8% and 16.1%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $19,437 per QALY gained or $78,412 per 1-year mortality-averted. Given the Chinese WTP threshold, the intervention had a 78% chance being cost-effective. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention was sensitive to cost of intervention and the proportion of patients who underwent surgery within 48 h. Conclusions: The multidisciplinary co-management program for patients with hip fracture is cost-effective and it has the potential to be scaled up in the Chinese population. © 2020, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",2020-01-32786,32219498,Osteoporosis Int.,K Peng,2020,31 / 8,1545-1553,No,32219498,"K Peng; M Yang; M Tian; M Chen; J Zhang; X Wu; R Ivers; L Si; Cost-effectiveness of a multidisciplinary co-management program for the older hip fracture patients in Beijing, Osteoporosis Int., 2020; 31(8):0937-941X; 1545-1553",QALY,China,Not Stated,Care Delivery,multidisciplinary co-management program vs. Standard/Usual Care- treated in the orthopedics department,"older patients, hip fracture, admitted to hospital",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,19437,United States,2019,19676.79
23162,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy for treatment resistant depression: 18-Month follow-up of the Halifax depression trial,"Background: Depressed patients with chronic and complex health issues commonly relapse; therefore, examining longer-term outcomes is an important consideration. For treatment resistant depression (TRD), the post-treatment efficacy of time-limited Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy (ISTDP) has been demonstrated but longer-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness are unclear. Method: In this superiority trial, 60 patients referred to Community Mental Health Teams (CMHT) were randomised to 2 groups (ISTDP=30 and CMHT=30). The primary outcome was Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) scores at 18 months. Secondary outcomes included Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression scores and dichotomous measure remission. A health economic evaluation examined mental health costs with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results: Statistically significant treatment differences in depression previously found at 6 months favouring ISTDP were maintained at 18-month follow-up. Group differences in depression were in the moderate to large range on both the observer rated (Cohen''s d = .64) and self-report measures (Cohen''s d = .70). At 18 months follow-up the remission rate in ISTDP patients was 40.0%, and 23.4% had discontinued antidepressants. Health economic analysis suggests that ISTDP was more cost-effective than CMHT at 18 months. Probabilistic analysis suggests that there is a 64.5% probability of ISTDP being cost-effective at a willingness to pay for a QALY of $25,000 compared to CMHT at 18 months. Limitations: Replication of these findings is necessary in larger samples and future cost analyses should also consider indirect costs. Conclusions: ISTDP demonstrates long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness in TRD. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020-01-32787,32421603,J.

23163,Cost-Utility of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Unipolar Depression: A Markov Model Simulation,"Background and Objective: Unipolar depression is the most common form of depression and demand for treatment, such as psychotherapy, is high. However, waiting times for psychotherapy often considerably exceed their recommended maximum. As a potentially less costly alternative treatment, internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) might help reduce waiting times. We therefore analyzed the cost–utility of ICBT compared to face-to-face CBT (FCBT) as an active control treatment, taking differences in waiting time into account. Methods: We constructed a Markov model to simulate costs and health outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for ICBT and FCBT in Germany. We modeled a time horizon of 3 years using six states (remission, depressed, spontaneous remission, undergoing treatment, treatment finished, death). The societal perspective was adopted. We obtained parameters for transition probabilities, depression-specific QoL, and cost data from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Within a scenario analysis, we simulated different time-to-treatment combinations. Half-cycle correction was applied. Results: In our simulation, ICBT generated 0.260 QALYs and saved €2536 per patient compared to FCBT. Our deterministic sensitivity analysis suggests that the base-case results were largely unaffected by parameter uncertainty and are therefore robust. Our probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that ICBT is highly likely to be more effective (91.5%), less costly (76.0%), and the dominant strategy (69.7%) compared to FCBT. The scenario analysis revealed that the base-case results are robust to variations in time-to-treatment differences. Conclusion: ICBT has a strong potential to balance demand and supply of CBT in unipolar depression by reducing therapist time per patient. It is highly likely to generate more QALYs and reduce health care expenditure. In addition, ICBT may have further positive external effects, such as freeing up capacities for the most severely depressed patients. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020-01-32790,32060822,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,M Baumann,2020,18 / 4,567-578,Yes,32060822,"M Baumann; T Stargardt; S Frey; Cost-Utility of Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy in Unipolar Depression: A Markov Model Simulation, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2020; 18(4):1179-1896; 567-578",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Care Delivery,internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy,Unipolar depression,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,-9825.58,Euro,2018,-11967.06
23164,Conventional Computed Tomographic Calcium Scoring vs full chest CTCS for lung cancer screening: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Background: Conventional CTCS images the mid/lower chest for coronary artery disease (CAD). Because many CAD patients are also at risk for lung malignancy, CTCS often discovers incidental pulmonary nodules (IPN). CTCS excludes the upper chest, where malignancy is common. Full-chest CTCS (FCT) may be a cost-effective screening tool for IPN. Methods: A decision tree was created to compare a FCT to CTCS in a hypothetical patient cohort with suspected CAD. (Figure) The design compares the effects of missed cancers on CTCS with the cost of working up non-malignant nodules on FCT. The model was informed by results of the National Lung Screening Trial and literature review, including the rate of malignancy among patients receiving CTCS and the rate of malignancy in upper vs lower portions of the lung. The analysis outcomes are Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is generally considered beneficial when <$50,000/QALY. Results: Literature review suggests that rate of IPNs in the upper portion of the lung varied from 47 to 76%. Our model assumed that IPNs occur in upper and lower portions of the lung with equal frequency. The model also assumes an equal malignancy potential in upper lung IPNs despite data that malignancy occurs 61-66% in upper lung fields. In the base case analysis, a FCT will lead to an increase of 0.03 QALYs comparing to conventional CTCS (14.54 vs 14.51 QALY, respectively), which translates into an QALY increase of 16 days. The associated incremental cost for FCT is $278 ($1027 vs $748, FCT vs CTCS respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is $10,289/QALY, suggesting significant benefit. Sensitivity analysis shows this benefit increases proportional to the rate of malignancy in upper lung fields. Conclusion: Conventional CTCS may be a missed opportunity to screen for upper lung field cancers in high risk patients. The ICER of FCT is better than screening for breast cancer screening (mammograms $80 k/QALY) and colon cancer (colonoscopy $6 k/QALY). Prospective studies are appropriate to define protocols for FCT. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020-01-32792,32631384,BMC Pulm.

23165,Cost-effectiveness of denosumab for high-risk postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in Thailand,"Aims: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of denosumab for treating postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (PMO) at high risk of fracture in Thailand. Materials and methods: A published Markov cohort cost-effectiveness model was populated with country-specific data as available and other published data as needed. The model used a societal perspective, lifetime horizon, efficacy data from network meta-analysis of trials, and included costs for direct medical and non-medical care, informal care, and osteoporosis treatments to compare denosumab to no pharmacologic treatment (calcium and vitamin D supplements only) and to oral weekly alendronate. The base case (high-risk population) included postmenopausal women with femoral neck T-score =-2.5, mean age 65 years at entry, and history of vertebral fracture. Results: High-risk women with osteoporosis using denosumab had the greatest number of life years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with higher reductions in hip and vertebral fracture incidence compared with patients with no pharmacologic treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 119,575 Thai Baht (THB) per QALY for denosumab versus no pharmacologic treatment and 199,186 THB per QALY for denosumab versus alendronate. Among Thai postmenopausal women with high-risk of fractures, denosumab was cost-effective compared with no pharmacologic treatment at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 160,000 THB per QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis showed models were most sensitive to changes in denosumab pricing. Limitations: Data from other countries used when country-specific data were unavailable may not accurately reflect the true experience in Thailand. The model focused explicitly on hip, vertebral, and wrist fractures, and therefore provides a conservative estimate of the overall potential impact of osteoporosis-related fracture. The fracture risk was not adjusted to reflect potential changes in risk after denosumab treatment discontinuation.

23167,Cost-effectiveness analysis of implantable cardiac devices in patients with systolic heart failure: a US perspective using real world data,"Aims: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has a substantial impact on costs and patients’ quality-of-life. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers (CRT-P), cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-D), and optimal pharmacologic therapy (OPT) in patients with HFrEF, from a US payer perspective. Materials and methods: The analyses were conducted by adapting the UK-based cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) to the US payer perspective by incorporating real world evidence (RWE) on baseline hospitalization risk and Medicare-specific costs. The CEA was based on regression equations estimated from data from 13 randomized clinical trials (n = 12,638). Risk equations were used to predict all-cause mortality, hospitalization rates, health-related quality-of-life, and device-specific treatment effects (vs. OPT). These equations included the following prognostic characteristics: age, QRS duration, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ischemic etiology, and left bundle branch block (LBBB). Baseline hospitalization rates were calibrated based on RWE from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan data (2009–2014). A US payer perspective, lifetime time horizon, and 3% discount rates for costs and outcomes were used. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for 24 sub-groups based on LBBB status, QRS duration, and NYHA class. Results: Results of the analyses show that CRT-D was the most cost-effective treatment at a $100,000/QALY threshold in 14 of the 16 sub-groups for which it is indicated. Results were most sensitive to changes in estimates of hospitalization costs. Limitations: Study limitations include small sample sizes for NYHA I and IV sub-groups and lack of data availability for duration of treatment effect.

Materials and methods: The analyses were conducted by adapting the UK-based cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) to the US payer perspective by incorporating real world evidence (RWE) on baseline hospitalization risk and Medicare-specific costs. The CEA was based on regression equations estimated from data from 13 randomized clinical trials (n = 12,638). Risk equations were used to predict all-cause mortality, hospitalization rates, health-related quality-of-life, and device-specific treatment effects (vs. OPT). These equations included the following prognostic characteristics: age, QRS duration, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, ischemic etiology, and left bundle branch block (LBBB). Baseline hospitalization rates were calibrated based on RWE from Truven Health Analytics MarketScan data (2009–2014). A US payer perspective, lifetime time horizon, and 3% discount rates for costs and outcomes were used. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for 24 sub-groups based on LBBB status, QRS duration, and NYHA class. Results: Results of the analyses show that CRT-D was the most cost-effective treatment at a $100,000/QALY threshold in 14 of the 16 sub-groups for which it is indicated. Results were most sensitive to changes in estimates of hospitalization costs. Limitations: Study limitations include small sample sizes for NYHA I and IV sub-groups and lack of data availability for duration of treatment effect. Conclusions: CRT-D has higher greater cost-effectiveness across more sub-groups in the indicated patient populations against as compared to OPT, ICD, and CRT-P, from a US payer perspective. © 2020, © 2020 Medtronic PLC.

23170,Cost-effectiveness analysis of endocrine therapy alone versus partial-breast irradiation alone versus combined treatment for low-risk hormone-positive early-stage breast cancer in women aged 70 years or older,"Purpose: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of three strategies for the adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer in women age 70 years or older: an aromatase inhibitor (AI-alone) for 5 years, a 5-fraction course of accelerated partial-breast irradiation using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (APBI-alone), or their combination. Methods: We constructed a patient-level Markov microsimulation from the societal perspective. Effectiveness data (local recurrence, distant metastases, survival), and toxicity data were obtained from randomized trials when possible. Costs of side effects were included. Costs were adjusted to 2019 US dollars and extracted from Medicare reimbursement data. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were calculated using utilities extracted from the literature. Results: The strategy of AI-alone ($12,637) was cheaper than both APBI-alone ($13,799) and combination therapy ($18,012) in the base case. All approaches resulted in similar QALY outcomes (AI-alone 7.775; APBI-alone 7.768; combination 7.807). In the base case, AI-alone was the cost-effective strategy and dominated APBI-alone, while combined therapy was not cost-effective when compared to AI-alone ($171,451/QALY) or APBI-alone ($107,932/QALY). In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, AI-alone was cost-effective at $100,000/QALY in 50% of trials, APBI-alone in 28% and the combination in 22%. Scenario analysis demonstrated that APBI-alone was more effective than AI-alone when AI compliance was lower than 26% at 5 years. Conclusions: Based on a Markov microsimulation analysis, both AI-alone and APBI-alone are appropriate options for patients 70 years or older with early breast cancer with small cost differences noted. A prospective trial comparing the approaches is warranted. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020-01-32796,32468336,Breast Cancer Res.

23173,New Oral Anticoagulants for Thromboprophylaxis in Patients with Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy: An Economic Evaluation in a Chinese Setting,"Background and Objective: Recent trials showed that thromboprophylaxis with new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) is effective and safe in patients with cancer initiating chemotherapy. However, the cost effectiveness of NOACs is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of preventing venous thromboembolism with NOACs with no thromboprophylaxis for patients with cancer initiating systemic chemotherapy from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. Methods: A decision analytical model consisting of both acute and chronic venous thromboembolism complications was used to assess the cost effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis with NOACs vs no thromboprophylaxis. The key clinical data were derived from the CASSINI and AVERT trials. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for the two strategies. Scenario and sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Compared with no thromboprophylaxis, NOACs gained 0.072 QALY at an incremental cost of $US930, leading to an ICER of 12,919/QALY in patients with Khorana scores = 2 by pooling the data from the CASSINI and AVERT trials. Among patients confirmed with no deep-vein thrombosis before thromboprophylaxis (the CASSINI trial) and patients without deep-vein thrombosis screening before thromboprophylaxis (the AVERT trial), the ICERs were $70,897/QALY and $87,204/QALY, respectively. The probability of NOACs being cost effective was 42% at a willingness to pay of $10,276/QALY. The ICER was sensitive to the relative risks of death and asymptomatic venous thromboembolism between NOACs and no thromboprophylaxis and the cost of NOACs. Conclusions: Thromboprophylaxis with NOACs is not likely to be cost effective in patients initiating chemotherapy in the Chinese context.

23179,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Patiromer in Combination with Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors for Chronic Kidney Disease in Sweden,"Objectives: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are commonly treated with renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) in order to delay progression of renal disease. However, research has shown that RAASi in CKD patients increases hyperkalaemia (HK) prevalence, which leads to RAASi discontinuation or dose reduction with the loss of benefits on the kidney. Patiromer is a novel therapy for HK treatment and may enable patients to remain on their RAASi regimen. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of patiromer from a Swedish healthcare perspective. Methods: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the economic outcomes of patiromer versus no patiromer in HK patients with stage 3–4 CKD taking RAASi. The model consisted of six health states reflecting disease progression and hospitalisations. The analysis mainly considered clinical data from the OPAL-HK trial and national costs. The main outcomes of interest were incremental costs (euro [EUR] 2016) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted at 3%, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Extensive uncertainty analyses were performed. Results: In comparison to no patiromer, a patiromer patient gained 0.14 QALYs and an incremental cost of EUR 6109 (Swedish krona [SEK] 57,850), yielding an ICER of EUR 43,307 (SEK 410,072)/QALY gained. The results were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 52,804 (SEK 500,000)/QALY, patiromer had a 50% chance of being cost-effective. Conclusions: The results indicate that patiromer may demonstrate value for money in Swedish patients with stage 3–4 CKD, by enabling RAASi treatment.

23180,Cost-Effectiveness of Coronary and Peripheral Artery Disease Antithrombotic Treatments in Finland,"Introduction: Currently, 15–20% of individuals with coronary artery disease (chronic coronary syndrome [CCS]) or peripheral artery disease (PAD) receiving routine treatment experience cardiovascular events (CVEs) within 3–4 years. Using PICOSTEPS (Patients-Intervention-Comparators-Outcomes-Setting-Time-Effects-Perspective-Sensitivity analysis) reporting, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of recently approved rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily in combination with acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg daily (RIV + ASA) for the prevention of CVEs among Finns with CCS or symptomatic PAD. Methods: Myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, acute limb ischemia, amputations, major extracranial bleeding, venous thromboembolism, and cardiovascular deaths were modeled in a Markov model examining a cohort of patients with CCS or symptomatic PAD. Relative effects of the intervention (RIV + ASA) and comparator (ASA) were based on the COMPASS trial. The primary outcome was 3%/year discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as cost (2019 euros) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in the Finnish setting over a lifetime horizon. In addition to nonfatal and fatal CVEs, the effects factored Finnish non-CVE mortality, quality of life, and direct costs from a public payer perspective. Disaggregated costs and QALYs, costs per life year gained (LYG), and ischemic strokes avoided, net monetary benefit (NMB), expected value of perfect information (EVPI), economic value-added (EVA), cost-effectiveness table, and acceptability frontier were examined. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: In the deterministic comparison with ASA over a lifetime horizon, RIV + ASA resulted in a benefit of 0.404 QALYs and 0.474 LYGs for an additional cost of €3241, resulting in an ICER of €8031/QALY. The probabilistic ICER was €4313/QALY (EVPI €1829/patient). RIV + ASA had positive NMB (€8791/patient), low EVPI (€88/patient), high EVA (€8703/patient), and 91% probability of cost-effectiveness using the willingness-to-pay of €25,254/QALY. The primary result was conservative and robust for RIV + ASA. Conclusion: RIV + ASA was a cost-effective treatment alternative compared with ASA in patients with CCS or symptomatic PAD in Finland. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020-01-32800,32519113,Adv.

23187,Health economic evaluation of screening and treating children with familial hypercholesterolemia early in life: Many happy returns on investment?,"Background and aims: There are no studies that have specifically investigated the cost-effectiveness of cascade screening of children for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and treatment of affected individuals with statins to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD). This study explores the cost-effectiveness of this strategy from the perspective of the Australian public healthcare system. Methods: A lifetime Markov model with four health states (Alive without CHD, Alive with CHD, Dead from fatal CHD, and Dead from other causes) was developed to simulate the progression of ten-year-old children screened for FH and treated immediately with statins if found to have FH. The underlying prevalence of FH in this target population was assumed to be 56.8%, and the sensitivity and specificity of testing were 100%. The comparator was usual care, which assumed that subjects started statins spontaneously at a later point or when they experienced a cardiovascular event. The effect of reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) on the risk of a first event at each age assumed that risk was proportional to total lifetime exposure and was implemented using Mendelian randomisation analysis data. Cost and other outcome data were sourced from published sources. Outcome of interests were costs in Australian dollars (AUD), life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of costs per LYG and per QALY gained. All future costs and outcomes were discounted by 5% annually. Results: Undiscounted results showed that compared with usual care, cascade screening of ten year-old children for FH and initiation of treatment of affected individuals saved 7.77 LYG and 7.53 QALYs per person over a lifetime. With 5% annual discounting, there were 0.97 LYG and 1.07 QALYs gained per person, at net reduction cost of -$1134. The cascade screening of ten-year-old children for FH and initiation of treatment compared to usual case was a cost saving approach. In 51.2% of iterations, screening and initiation with statin were cost saving and in 48.8% of iterations were cost-effective. In most of the one-way sensitivity and scenario analyses, the ICER stayed within the accepted Australian threshold. Conclusions: Compared to usual care, cascade screening of ten-year-old children for FH and treating affected individuals are likely to be cost saving. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020-01-32808,32526542,Atherosclerosis,Z Ademi,2020,304 /,1-8,No,32526542,"Z Ademi; R Norman; J Pang; D Liew; S Zoungas; E Sijbrands; A Ference; A Wiegman; F Watts; Health economic evaluation of screening and treating children with familial hypercholesterolemia early in life: Many happy returns on investment?, Atherosclerosis, 2020; 304():0021-9150; 1-8",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Screening",heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia screening --> statin treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,10 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-1057.56,Australia,2019,-744.45
23188,Cost-effectiveness of Telemedicine-directed Specialized vs Standard Care for Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in a Randomized Trial,"Background & Aims: Telemedicine can be used to monitor determinants and outcomes of patients with chronic diseases, possibly increasing the quality and value of care. Telemedicine was found to reduce outpatient visits and hospital admissions for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We performed a full economic evaluation of telemedicine interventions in patients with IBD, comparing the cost-utility of telemedicine vs standard care. Methods: We performed a randomized trial of 909 patients with IBD at 2 academic and 2 non-academic hospitals in The Netherlands. Patients were randomly assigned to groups that received telemedicine (myIBDcoach; n = 465) or standard outpatient care (n = 444) and followed for 12 months. Costs were measured from a societal perspective. Direct healthcare costs were based on actual resource use. Indirect costs comprised self-reported hours sick leave from work, intervention costs (annual license fee of €40 per patient [$45]), and utility costs (assessed using EQ5D). Cost-utility and uncertainty were estimated using the non-parametric bootstrapping method. Results: Telemedicine resulted in lower mean annual costs of €547/patient [$612] (95% CI, €1029–2143 [$1150-2393]; mean costs of €9481 [$10,587] for standard care and €8924 [$9965] for telemedicine) without changing quality adjusted life years. At the Dutch threshold of €80,000 [$89,335] per quality adjusted life year, the intervention had increased incremental cost-effectiveness over standard care in 83% of replications and an incremental net monetary benefit of €707/patient [$790] (95% CI, €1241–2544 [$1386-2841]). Conclusions: Telemedicine with myIBDcoach is cost saving and has a high probability of being cost effective for patients with IBD. This self-management tool enables continuous registration of quality indicators and (patient-reported) outcomes and might help reorganize IBD care toward value-based healthcare.

23189,Cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in the United Kingdom,"Aims: To assess the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, as an adjunct to insulin in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) inadequately controlled by insulin alone in the UK setting. Methods: A cost–utility analysis was conducted to compare dapagliflozin (5 mg or 10 mg) added to insulin versus insulin monotherapy (standard of care) over a lifetime horizon. Treatment efficacy and safety data were obtained from 52-week results of the DEPICT-1 and DEPICT-2 trials and a network meta-analysis of SGLT2 inhibitors in T1DM. Direct healthcare costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated from a UK payer perspective and discounted at 3.5% annually, using the Cardiff T1DM Model. Sensitivity analyses assessed uncertainty in estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: Dapagliflozin 5 mg was associated with gains of 0.23 life-years and 0.42 QALYs, at an additional cost of £4240 per person; corresponding to an ICER of £10 143 versus standard of care. For dapagliflozin 10 mg, incremental life-years, QALYs and costs were 0.24, 0.49 and £2964, respectively; corresponding to an ICER of £6103 versus standard of care. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ICER estimates fell below £20 000/QALY in 78% to 90% of simulations. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to changes in baseline patient characteristics and treatment effects on glycated haemoglobin; however, ICERs remained below £20 000.

23191,Optimization of hepatitis C virus screening strategies by birth cohort in Italy,"Background and Aims: Cost-effective screening strategies are needed to make hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination a reality. We determined if birth cohort screening is cost-effective in Italy. Methods: A model was developed to quantify screening and healthcare costs associated with HCV. The model-estimated prevalence of undiagnosed HCV was used to calculate the antibody screens needed annually, with a €25 000 cost-effectiveness threshold. Outcomes were assessed under the status quo and a scenario that met the World Health Organization''s targets for elimination of HCV. The elimination scenario was assessed under five screening strategies. Results: A graduated birth cohort screening strategy (graduated screening 1: 1968-1987 birth cohorts, then expanding to 1948-1967 cohorts) was the least costly. This strategy would gain approximately 144 000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 2031 and result in an 89.3% reduction in HCV cases, compared to an 89.6%, 89.0%, 89.7% and 88.7% reduction for inversed graduated screening, 1948-77 birth cohort, 1958-77 birth cohort and universal screening, respectively. Graduated screening 1 yielded the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €3552 per QALY gained. Conclusions: In Italy, a graduated screening scenario is the most cost-effective strategy. Other countries could consider a similar birth cohort approach when developing HCV screening strategies. © 2020 The Authors.

The model-estimated prevalence of undiagnosed HCV was used to calculate the antibody screens needed annually, with a €25 000 cost-effectiveness threshold. Outcomes were assessed under the status quo and a scenario that met the World Health Organization''s targets for elimination of HCV. The elimination scenario was assessed under five screening strategies. Results: A graduated birth cohort screening strategy (graduated screening 1: 1968-1987 birth cohorts, then expanding to 1948-1967 cohorts) was the least costly. This strategy would gain approximately 144 000 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 2031 and result in an 89.3% reduction in HCV cases, compared to an 89.6%, 89.0%, 89.7% and 88.7% reduction for inversed graduated screening, 1948-77 birth cohort, 1958-77 birth cohort and universal screening, respectively. Graduated screening 1 yielded the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €3552 per QALY gained. Conclusions: In Italy, a graduated screening scenario is the most cost-effective strategy. Other countries could consider a similar birth cohort approach when developing HCV screening strategies. © 2020 The Authors.

23196,An Economic Evaluation of Pembrolizumab Versus Other Adjuvant Treatment Strategies for Resected High-Risk Stage III Melanoma in the USA,"Background and Objective: Over the past 5 years, adjuvant treatment options for surgically resected stage III melanoma have expanded with the introduction of several novel immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies. Pembrolizumab, a programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor, received US Food and Drug Administration approval in 2019 for resected high-risk stage III melanoma based on significantly longer recurrence-free survival versus placebo. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus other adjuvant treatment strategies for resected high-risk stage III melanoma from a US health system perspective. Methods: A Markov cohort-level model with four states (recurrence-free, locoregional recurrence, distant metastases, death) estimated costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for pembrolizumab versus routine observation and other adjuvant comparators: ipilimumab in the overall population; and dabrafenib + trametinib in the BRAF-mutation positive (BRAF+) subgroup. Transition probabilities starting from recurrence-free were estimated through parametric multi-state modeling based on phase 3 KEYNOTE-054 (NCT02362594) trial data for pembrolizumab and observation, and network meta-analyses for other comparators. Post-recurrence transitions were modeled based on electronic medical records data and trials in advanced/metastatic melanoma. Utilities were derived using quality-of-life data from KEYNOTE-054 and literature. Costs of treatment, adverse events, disease management, and terminal care were included. Results: Over a lifetime, pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, and observation were associated with QALYs of 9.24, 7.09, and 5.95 and total costs of $511,290, $992,721, and $461,422, respectively (2019 US dollars). Pembrolizumab was thus dominant (less costly, more effective) versus ipilimumab, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $15,155/QALY versus observation. In the BRAF+ subgroup, pembrolizumab dominated dabrafenib + trametinib and observation, decreasing costs by $62,776 and $11,250 and increasing QALYs by 0.93 and 3.10 versus these comparators, respectively. Results were robust in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: As adjuvant treatment for resected stage III melanoma, pembrolizumab was found to be dominant and therefore cost-effective compared with the active comparators ipilimumab and dabrafenib + trametinib. Pembrolizumab increased costs relative to observation in the overall population, with sufficient incremental benefit to be considered cost-effective based on typical willingness-to-pay thresholds. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020-01-32815,32418051,Clin Drug Investig,G Bensimon,2020,40 / 7,629-643,Yes,32418051,"G Bensimon; -Y Zhou; M Jenkins; Y Song; W Gao; J Signorovitch; C Krepler; E Scherrer; J Wang; R Aguiar-Ibáñez; An Economic Evaluation of Pembrolizumab Versus Other Adjuvant Treatment Strategies for Resected High-Risk Stage III Melanoma in the USA, Clin Drug Investig, 2020; 40(7):1179-1918; 629-643",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,ipilimumab vs. pembrolizumab,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-223921.4,United States,2019,-226683.88

23198,Cost-effectiveness analysis of proton beam therapy for treatment decision making in paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers in China,"Background: Cost-effectiveness is a pivotal consideration for clinical decision making of high-tech cancer treatment in developing countries. Intensity-modulated proton radiation therapy (IMPT, the advanced form of proton beam therapy) has been found to improve the prognosis of the patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers compared with intensity-modulated photon-radiation therapy (IMRT). However, the cost-effectiveness of IMPT has not yet been fully evaluated. This study aimed at evaluating the cost-effectiveness of IMPT versus IMRT for treatment decision making of paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers in Chinese settings. Methods: A 3-state Markov model was designed for cost-effectiveness analysis. A base case evaluation was performed on a patient of 47-year-old (median age of patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers in China). Model robustness was examined by probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Markov cohort analysis and Tornado diagram. Cost-effective scenarios of IMPT were further identified by one-way sensitivity analyses and stratified analyses were performed for different age levels. The outcome measure of the model was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A strategy was defined as cost-effective if the ICER was below the societal willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of China (30,828 US dollars ($) / quality-adjusted life year (QALY)). Results: IMPT was identified as being cost-effective for the base case at the WTP of China, providing an extra 1.65 QALYs at an additional cost of $38,928.7 compared with IMRT, and had an ICER of $23,611.2 / QALY. Of note, cost-effective scenarios of IMPT only existed in the following independent conditions: probability of IMPT eradicating cancer =0.867; probability of IMRT eradicating cancer =0.764; or cost of IMPT = $52,163.9. Stratified analyses for different age levels demonstrated that IMPT was more cost-effective in younger patients than older patients, and was cost-effective only in patients =56-year-old. Conclusions: Despite initially regarded as bearing high treatment cost, IMPT could still be cost-effective for patients with paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers in China. The tumor control superiority of IMPT over IMRT and the patient''s age should be the principal considerations for clinical decision of prescribing this new irradiation technique. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020-01-32816,32590957,BMC Cancer,G Li,2020,20 / 1,-,No,32590957,"G Li; B Qiu; B Qiu; -X Huang; J Doyen; J Doyen; -Y Bondiau; -Y Bondiau; K Benezery; K Benezery; -F Xia; -F Xia; -N Qian; -N Qian; Cost-effectiveness analysis of proton beam therapy for treatment decision making in paranasal sinus and nasal cavity cancers in China, BMC Cancer, 2020; 20(1):; -",QALY,China,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,intensity-modulated proton radiation therapy vs. intensity-modulated photon-radiation therapy,Not Stated,64 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,23116.2,United States,2019,23401.38
23199,The Clinical and Cost-Effectiveness of Telerehabilitation for People With Nonspecific Chronic Low Back Pain: Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Telerehabilitation can facilitate multidisciplinary management for people with nonspecific chronic low back pain (NCLBP). It provides health care access to individuals who are physically and economically disadvantaged. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation compared with a clinic-based intervention for people with NCLBP in Nigeria. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial from a health care perspective was conducted. Patients with NCLBP were assigned to either telerehabilitation-based McKenzie therapy (TBMT) or clinic-based McKenzie therapy (CBMT). Interventions were carried out 3 times weekly for a period of 8 weeks. Patients'' level of disability was measured using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at baseline, week 4, and week 8. To estimate the health-related quality of life of the patients, the ODI was mapped to the short-form six dimensions instrument to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Health care resource use and costs were assessed based on the McKenzie extension protocol in Nigeria in 2019. Descriptive and inferential data analyses were also performed to assess the clinical effectiveness of the interventions. Bootstrapping was conducted to generate the point estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: A total of 47 patients (TBMT, n=21 and CBMT, n=26), with a mean age of 47 (SD 11.6) years for telerehabilitation and 50 (SD 10.7) years for the clinic-based intervention, participated in this study. The mean cost estimates of TBMT and CBMT interventions per person were 22,200 naira (US $61.7) and 38,200 naira (US $106), respectively. QALY gained was 0.085 for TBMT and 0.084 for CBMT. The TBMT arm was associated with an additional 0.001 QALY (95% CI 0.001 to 0.002) per participant compared with the CBMT arm. Thus, the ICER showed that the TBMT arm was less costly and more effective than the CBMT arm. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the study suggested that telerehabilitation for people with NCLBP was cost saving. Given the small number of participants in this study, further examination of effects and costs of the interventions is needed within a larger sample size. In addition, future studies are required to assess the cost-effectiveness of this intervention in the long term from the patient and societal perspective. ©Francis Fatoye, Tadesse Gebrye, Clara Fatoye, Chidozie E Mbada, Mistura I Olaoye, Adesola C Odole, Olumide Dada.

23200,Economic evaluation of surgical treatments for women with stress urinary incontinence: a cost-utility and value of information analysis,"Objectives Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) are common conditions that can have a negative impact on the quality of life of patients and serious cost implications for healthcare providers. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of nine different surgical interventions for treatment of SUI and stress-predominant MUI from a National Health Service and personal social services perspective in the UK. Methods A Markov microsimulation model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nine surgical interventions. The model was informed by undertaking a systematic review of clinical effectiveness and network meta-analysis. The main clinical parameters in the model were the cure and incidence rates of complications after different interventions. The outcomes from the model were expressed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. In addition, expected value of perfect information (EVPI) analyses were conducted to quantify the main uncertainties facing decision-makers. Results The base-case results suggest that retropubic mid-urethral sling (retro-MUS) is the most cost-effective surgical intervention over a 10-year and lifetime time horizon. The probabilistic results show that retro-MUS and traditional sling are the interventions with the highest probability of being cost-effective across all willingness-to-pay thresholds over a lifetime time horizon. The value of information analysis results suggest that the largest value appears to be in removing uncertainty around the incidence rates of complications, the relative treatment effectiveness and health utility values. Conclusions Although retro-MUS appears, at this stage, to be a cost-effective intervention, research is needed on possible long-term complications of all surgical treatments to provide reassurance of safety, or earlier warning of unanticipated adverse effects. The value of information analysis supports the need, as a first step, for further research to improve our knowledge of the actual incidence of complications. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.
