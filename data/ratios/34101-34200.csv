34101,Cost-effectiveness of Novel Treatment Sequences for Transplant-Ineligible Patients With Multiple Myeloma.,"Importance: Although the number of treatments for elderly patients with non-transplant-eligible (NTE) multiple myeloma (MM) has increased substantially, evidence is lacking on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of novel treatment sequences. Objective: To determine the optimal sequence of treatment for patients with NTE MM from the perspective of the patient, physician, and society. Design, setting, and participants: Using data from a Dutch observational registry, this economic evaluation combined evidence from network meta-analyses in a patient-level simulation model and modeled time-to-event and types of events from a hospital perspective with a lifetime horizon. Data analysis was performed from June 2019 to September 2020. Interventions: Thirty treatment sequences, including up to 3 lines of therapy, were compared with bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP)-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (LenDex)-pomalidomide-dexamethasone (PomDex). Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcomes of the model were overall survival (OS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost-effectiveness. Results: Sequences starting with daratumumab-VMP (second line: carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone or elotuzumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) or bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide-maintenance bortezomib-thalidomide (VMPT-VT) (second line: daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) had the largest expected OS (7.5 years), which is 3.5 additional life-years compared with VMP-LenDex-PomDex. Total costs per patient for these sequences ranged between $786 024 and $1 085 794. The sequence VMPT-VT-carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone-panobinostat-bortezomib-dexamethasone had the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio ($98 585 per life-year gained and $132 707 per QALY gained vs VMP-LenDex-PomDex). Conclusions and relevance: These findings suggest that sequences including novel treatments were highly effective, but the cost-effectiveness ratios were above currently accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds. Treating MM with novel agents necessitates either a large increase in budget or a substantial reduction of drug costs by price negotiations, and these findings can support these reimbursement decisions and price negotiations.",2021-01-41687,33779744,JAMA Netw Open,Hedwig Blommestein,2021,4 / 3,e213497,No,33779744,"Hedwig Blommestein; Margreet Franken; Chrissy van Beurden-Tan; Nicole Blijlevens; Peter Huijgens; Pieter Sonneveld; Carin Uyl-de Groot; Sonja Zweegman; Cost-effectiveness of Novel Treatment Sequences for Transplant-Ineligible Patients With Multiple Myeloma., JAMA Netw Open, 2021 Mar 1; 4(3):; e213497",QALY,Netherlands,"Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissue",Pharmaceutical,melphalan-prednisone-bortezomib + daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone + pomalidomide-dexamethasone vs. melphalan-prednisone-bortezomib + lenalidomide-dexamethasone + pomalidomide-dexamethasone,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",4.00,1.50,322100,United States,2021,322100

Objective: To determine the optimal sequence of treatment for patients with NTE MM from the perspective of the patient, physician, and society. Design, setting, and participants: Using data from a Dutch observational registry, this economic evaluation combined evidence from network meta-analyses in a patient-level simulation model and modeled time-to-event and types of events from a hospital perspective with a lifetime horizon. Data analysis was performed from June 2019 to September 2020. Interventions: Thirty treatment sequences, including up to 3 lines of therapy, were compared with bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP)-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (LenDex)-pomalidomide-dexamethasone (PomDex). Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcomes of the model were overall survival (OS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost-effectiveness. Results: Sequences starting with daratumumab-VMP (second line: carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone or elotuzumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) or bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide-maintenance bortezomib-thalidomide (VMPT-VT) (second line: daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) had the largest expected OS (7.5 years), which is 3.5 additional life-years compared with VMP-LenDex-PomDex.

This study assessed the economic outcomes of different DPP-4 inhibitors in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin in the Chinese context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the validated Chinese Outcomes Model for T2DM (COMT) was conducted to project economic outcomes from the perspective of Chinese healthcare service providers. Efficacy and safety, medical expenditure, and utility data were derived from the literature, which were assigned to model variables. The primary outputs of the model included the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probability sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the potential uncertainties of parameters. RESULTS: Of the five competing strategies, alogliptin 25 mg strategy yielded the most significant health outcome, which associated with improvements in discounted QALY of 0.007, 0.014, 0.011, and 0.022 versus linagliptin 5 mg, saxagliptin 5 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg and vildagliptin50 mg, respectively.

34118,Cost-effectiveness of nivolumab in patients with NSCLC in the United States.,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the lifetime cost-effectiveness of nivolumab vs docetaxel in advanced squamous and nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following platinum-based chemotherapy from a US payer perspective. STUDY DESIGN: Trial- and cohort-based cost-effectiveness analyses. METHODS: The analyses used partitioned survival models with 3 mutually exclusive health states: progression free, progressed disease, and death. The mean starting age was 61 years. Clinical parameters were derived from the 2 registrational, randomized, phase 3 trials with a minimum follow-up of 5 years. Costs were derived from published literature. The primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years gained (LYG), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Uncertainty was examined using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In patients with squamous NSCLC, the use of nivolumab improved life-years (LYs) and QALYs by 1.23 and 0.99, respectively, compared with docetaxel. Costs were increased by $99,677, resulting in ICERs of $100,776 per QALY and $81,294 per LYG. In patients with nonsquamous NSCLC, nivolumab increased LYs and QALYs by 0.99 and 0.80, respectively. Costs were increased by $94,174, resulting in ICERs of $117,739 per QALY and $94,849 per LYG. ICERs were most sensitive to the discount rates applied to costs and outcomes. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000, nivolumab had probabilities of 91% and 99% of being cost-effective in patients with squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC, respectively.

34120,The cost-effectiveness of genotyping versus sequencing for prenatal cystic fibrosis carrier screening.,"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the cost-effectiveness of three sequential prenatal cystic fibrosis (CF) carrier screening strategies: genotyping both partners, genotyping one partner then sequencing the second, and sequencing both partners. METHOD: A decision-analytic model compared the strategies in a theoretical cohort of four million pregnant couples in the US population and five racial/ethnic sub-populations. Inputs were obtained from literature and varied in sensitivity analysis. Outcomes included cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), missed carrier couples, affected newborns, missed prenatal diagnoses, terminations, and procedure-related losses. The cost-effectiveness threshold was $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: Sequencing both partners identified 1099 carrier couples that were missed by genotyping both partners, leading to 273 fewer missed prenatal diagnoses, 152 more terminations, and 152 fewer affected newborns. A similar trend was observed in the genotyping followed by sequencing strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of genotyping followed by sequencing compared to genotyping both partners was $180,004/QALY and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of sequencing both partners compared to genotyping followed by sequencing was $17.6 million/QALY. Sequencing both partners was cost-effective below $339 per test, genotyping/sequencing between $340 and $1837, and genotyping both partners above $1838.

34122,Sarcopenia screening strategies in older people: a cost effectiveness analysis in Iran.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sarcopenia is an important age-related disease which can lead to an increased risk of mortality, falls, fractures, and poor quality of life. So, timely detection can be effective in reducing the burden of disease. The aim of this study was to identify the most cost-effective strategy for sarcopenia screening in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov transition model over a life-time horizon based on natural history. Compared strategies included Sarcopenia scoring assessment models (SarSA-Mod), European working group on sarcopenia in older people (EWGSOP), Mini sarcopenia risk assessment (MSRA) and SARC-F. Parameters values were extracted from primary data and the literature, and the costs and Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated for each strategy. Sensitivity analysis of uncertain parameters was also performed to determine the robustness of the model. Analysis was performed using 2020 version of TreeAge Pro software. RESULTS: All four screening strategies increased life time QALYs. After removing dominated strategy, the incremental cost per QALY gained for sarcopenia screening varied from $1875.67 for EWGSOP to $1898.33 for MSRA.

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was compared with a willingness-to-pay(WTP) threshold of $100,000/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: At 3 years, costs for index patient 1 were $10,290(PCNL), $10,109(mini-PCNL), $5,930(RIRS), and $10,916(SWL).

34131,The cost-effectiveness of Cochlear implants in Swedish adults.,"BACKGROUND: Research has shown unilateral cochlear implants (CIs) significantly improve clinical outcomes and quality of life in adults. However, only 13% of eligible Swedish adults currently use a unilateral CI. The objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of unilateral CIs compared to a hearing aid for Swedish adults with severe to profound hearing loss. METHODS: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon and six-month cycle length was developed to estimate the benefits and costs of unilateral CIs from the Swedish health system perspective. A treatment pathway was developed through consultation with clinical experts to estimate resource use and costs. Unit costs were derived from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare and the Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions. Health outcomes were reported in terms of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). RESULTS: Unilateral CIs for Swedish adults with severe to profound hearing loss are likely to be deemed cost-effective when compared to a hearing aid (SEK 140,474 per QALY gained). The results were most sensitive to the age when patients are implanted with a CI and the proportion of patients eligible for CIs after triage. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in the prevalence of Swedish adults with severe to profound hearing loss is expected as the population ages. Earlier implantation of unilateral CIs improves the cost-effectiveness among people eligible for CIs. Unilateral CIs are an efficacious and cost-effective option to improve hearing and quality of life in Swedish adults with severe to profound hearing loss.",2021-01-41656,33832467,BMC Health Serv Res,Mutsa Gumbie,2021,21 / 1,319,No,33832467,"Mutsa Gumbie; Emma Olin; Bonny Parkinson; Ross Bowman; Henry Cutler; The cost-effectiveness of Cochlear implants in Swedish adults., BMC Health Serv Res, 2021 Apr 8; 21(1):; 319",QALY,Sweden,Other disorders of ear,Medical Device,unilateral cochlear implant vs. hearing aid,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,140474,Sweden,2019,15752.19
34132,Cost-effectiveness of a Digital Health Intervention for Acute Myocardial Infarction Recovery.,"BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common cause of hospital admissions, readmissions, and mortality worldwide. Digital health interventions (DHIs) that promote self-management, adherence to guideline-directed therapy, and cardiovascular risk reduction may improve health outcomes in this population. The ""Corrie"" DHI consists of a smartphone application, smartwatch, and wireless blood pressure monitor to support medication tracking, education, vital signs monitoring, and care coordination. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of this DHI plus standard of care in reducing 30-day readmissions among AMI patients in comparison to standard of care alone. METHODS: A Markov model was used to explore cost-effectiveness from the hospital perspective. The time horizon of the analysis was 1 year, with 30-day cycles, using inflation-adjusted cost data with no discount rate. Currencies were quantified in US dollars, and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The results were interpreted as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Univariate sensitivity and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model uncertainty. RESULTS: The DHI reduced costs and increased QALYs on average, dominating standard of care in 99.7% of simulations in the probabilistic analysis. Based on the assumption that the DHI costs $2750 per patient, use of the DHI leads to a cost-savings of $7274 per patient compared with standard of care alone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that this DHI is cost-saving through the reduction of risk for all-cause readmission following AMI.

34133,"Cost-effectiveness of dual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among the elderly in Shenzhen, China.","OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of dual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for the elderly in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model with a weekly cycle was developed to compare the outcomes of dual influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for the prevention of influenza and pneumococcal infections compared with no vaccination among 70-74 years old people in Shenzhen over 5 years. The model allowed seasonal variation of influenza activity. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) discounted at 5% annually from the societal perspective. The impact of parameter uncertainty on the results was examined using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). RESULTS: In the base case, dual vaccination prevented 5042 influenza infections, 26 IPD cases, 3 disabilities, 34 deaths, and cost US$7.1 per person while resulting in a net gain of 0.0026 QALYs compared with no vaccination. Using once the Chinese gross domestic product per capita in 2019 (US$10,289) as the willingness-to-pay threshold, dual vaccination was cost-effective with an ICER of US$2699 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the ICER was relatively sensitive to changes in influenza attack rates and influenza vaccine effectiveness. Based on the results of PSA with 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, receiving both vaccines was cost-effective in 100% of the repetitions.

34134,Modelling the Cost-Effectiveness of Implementing a Dietary Intervention in Renal Transplant Recipients.,"BACKGROUND: The Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and potassium supplementation have been shown to reduce the risk of death with a functioning graft (DWFG) and renal graft failure in renal transplant recipients (RTR). Unfortunately, a key problem for patients is the adherence to these diets. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of higher adherence to either the DASH or potassium supplementation. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the life course of 1000 RTR in the Netherlands. A societal perspective with a lifetime time horizon was used. The potential effect of improvement of dietary adherence was modelled in different scenarios. The primary outcomes are the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and the budget impact. RESULTS: In the base case, improved adherence to the DASH diet saved 27,934,786 and gained 1880 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Improved adherence to potassium supplementation saved €1,217,803 and gained 2901 QALYs. Both resulted in dominant ICERs. The budget impact over a five-year period for the entire Dutch RTR population was €8,144,693.

34135,Cost-effectiveness of 'screen-and-treat' interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder following major incidents.,"OBJECTIVES: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly experienced in the aftermath of major incidents such as terrorism and pandemics. Well-established principles of response include effective and scalable treatment for individuals affected by PTSD. In England, such responses have combined proactive outreach, screening and evidence-based interventions (a 'screen-and-treat' approach), but little is known about its cost-effectiveness. The objective of this paper is to report the first systematic attempt to assess the cost-effectiveness of this approach. METHODS: A decision modelling analysis was undertaken to estimate the costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from a screen-and-treat approach compared with treatment-as-usual, the latter involving identification of PTSD by general practitioners and referral to psychological therapy services. Model input variables were drawn from relevant empirical studies in the context of terrorism and the unit costs of health and social care in England. The model was run over a 5-year time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 exposed adults from the perspective of the National Health Service and Personal Social Services in England. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained was £7931. This would be considered cost-effective 88% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY gained, the threshold associated with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in England. Sensitivity analysis confirmed this result was robust. CONCLUSIONS: A screen-and-treat approach for identifying and treating PTSD in adults following terrorist attacks appears cost-effective in England compared with treatment-as-usual through conventional primary care routes. Although this finding was in the context of terrorism, the implications might be translatable into other major incident-related scenarios including the current COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-01-41646,34620659,BMJ Open,Nicole Hogan,2021,11 / 10,e049472,No,34620659,"Nicole Hogan; Martin Knapp; David McDaid; Mark Davies; Chris Brewin; Cost-effectiveness of 'screen-and-treat' interventions for post-traumatic stress disorder following major incidents., BMJ Open, 2021 Oct 7; 11(10):; e049472",QALY,United Kingdom,"Neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders","Health Education or Behavior, Screening",post-traumatic stress disorder screening + cognitive behavior therapy vs. treatment as usual,exposed to terrorism or other major incidents,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"5 Years, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,7931,United Kingdom,2018,11436.12
34136,Cost-utility Analysis Comparing Bracing Versus Observation for Skeletally Immature Patients with Thoracic Scoliosis.,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the cost-utility of bracing versus observation in patients with thoracic scoliosis who would be indicated for bracing. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is high-quality evidence that bracing can prevent radiographic progression of spinal curvature in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients with curves between 25° and 40° and Risser 0 to 2 skeletal maturity index. However, to our knowledge, the cost-utility of bracing in AIS has not been established. METHODS: A decision-analysis model comparing bracing versus observation was developed for a hypothetical 10-year old girl (Risser 0, Sanders 3) with a 35° main thoracic curve. We estimated the probability, cost, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for each node based on comprehensive review of the literature. Costs were adjusted for inflation based on Consumer Price Index and reported in terms of 2020 real dollars. Incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) was calculated based on a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations of 1000 hypothetical patients. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed by varying cost, probability, and QALY estimates. RESULTS: Our decision-analysis model revealed that bracing was the dominant treatment choice over observation at $50,000/QALY willingness to pay threshold. In simulation analysis of a hypothetical patient cohort, bracing was associated with lower net lifetime costs ($60,377 ± $5,340 with bracing vs. $85,279 ± $4543 with observation) and higher net lifetime QALYs (24.1 ± 2.0 with bracing vs. 23.9 ± 1.8 with observation). Bracing was associated with an INMB of $36,093 (95% confidence interval $18,894-$55,963) over observation over the patient's lifetime. The model was most sensitive to the impact of bracing versus observation on altering the probability of requiring surgery, either as an adolescent or an adult. CONCLUSION: Cost-utility analysis supports scoliosis bracing as the preferred choice in management of appropriately indicated AIS patients with thoracic scoliosis.Level of Evidence: 5.",2021-01-41642,34366411,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Ijezie Ikwuezunma,2021,46 / 23,1653-1659,No,34366411,"Ijezie Ikwuezunma; Kevin Wang; Adam Margalit; Paul Sponseller; Amit Jain; Cost-utility Analysis Comparing Bracing Versus Observation for Skeletally Immature Patients with Thoracic Scoliosis., Spine (Phila Pa 1976), 2021 Dec 1; 46(23):; 1653-1659",QALY,United States of America,Dorsopathies,Medical Procedure,bracing vs. observation,"skeletally immature, with curves between 25 degrees and 40 degrees, Risser 0 to 2 skeletal maturity index",79 Years,10 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,-111271,United States,2020,-116498.54
34137,Clinical implications and cost-effectiveness analysis of rivaroxaban in patients with coronary artery disease or peripheral arterial disease in the Netherlands.,"BACKGROUND: Patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease (PAD) are at substantial risk of atherothrombotic events. The COMPASS trial showed that patients with stable CAD or PAD experienced significant benefits after treatment with rivaroxaban in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) compared with ASA alone. This paper aims to provide insight into the clinical and economic consequences of treatment with rivaroxaban from a Dutch societal perspective. METHODS: The clinical and economic implications of rivaroxaban in terms of the number of events prevented, costs, the incremental cost per life-years gained (LYG), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were determined based on a cost-effectiveness model for patients with stable CAD or PAD and in high-risk subgroups (i.e. patients with CAD and PAD, CAD and prior myocardial infarction and renal impairment, CAD and heart failure) using results from the Cardiovascular OutcoMes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial. RESULTS: Patients treated with rivaroxaban have an expected increased discounted life expectancy of 0.67 years. In high-risk groups discounted incremental life expectancy ranged from 1.33 to 1.90 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the full COMPASS population was €9,760/LYG and €12,033/QALY, whereas, for high-risk subgroups of patients with underlying conditions, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from €2,966/LYG to €5,052/LYG and from €3,940/QALY to €6,815/QALY. Results from the sensitivity analyses revealed that the model results were robust to variations in single or multiple input parameters at once. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that rivaroxaban in combination with ASA is a cost-effective treatment option in stable CAD or PAD patients.

34138,Cost-Effectiveness of Vedolizumab in the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Crohn's Disease in China.,"INTRODUCTION: To compare the cost-effectiveness of vedolizumab with that of conventional therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe active Crohn's disease (CD) in China. METHODS: A decision tree and Markov model were built to predict the lifetime cost and health outcomes in the induction phase and maintenance phase of vedolizumab treatment and conventional therapy (a combination of corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, and aminosalicylates) in adult patients with moderate-to-severe active CD from the perspective of China's healthcare system. Clinical efficacy and health utility were derived from the GEMINI 2 and GEMINI 3 trials and published literature. Costs were mainly obtained from clinical physician surveys in China and are presented in 2020 US dollars. Health outcomes (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) and costs were discounted at an annual rate of 5%. The incremental cost per QALY gained was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of the two treatments. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The model predicted more QALYs (9.92 vs 9.00 QALYs) and lower incurred costs ($288,284 vs $309,680) in vedolizumab than in conventional therapy in a mixed population (anti-TNF-naïve and anti-TNF-failure populations) over a lifetime horizon in the base-case analysis. Similar results were observed in the anti-TNF-naïve and anti-TNF-failure subgroups of patients with CD. One-way sensitivity analysis results suggested that health state cost was the most influential factor in the model. The PSA results supported the dominance of vedolizumab in the base-case analysis.

34142,"Efficacy of a tight-control and treat-to-target strategy in axial spondyloarthritis: results of the open-label, pragmatic, cluster-randomised TICOSPA trial.","OBJECTIVES: To compare the benefits of a tight-control/treat-to-target strategy (TC/T2T) in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) with those of usual care (UC). METHODS: Pragmatic, prospective, cluster-randomised, controlled, open, 1-year trial (NCT03043846). 18 centres were randomised (1:1). Patients met Axial Spondylo Arthritis International Society (ASAS) criteria for axSpA, had an Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) ≥2.1, received non-optimal treatment by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and were biologic-naive. INTERVENTIONS: (1) TC/T2T: visits every 4 weeks and prespecified strategy based on treatment intensification until achieving target (ie, ASDAS <2.1); (2) UC: visits every 12 weeks and treatment at the rheumatologist's discretion. MAIN OUTCOME: Percentage of patients with a ≥30% improvement on the ASAS-Health Index (ASAS-HI). Other efficacy outcomes and adverse events were recorded. A health economic evaluation was performed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Two-level mixed models were used to estimate efficacy outcomes. Cost-effectiveness was assessed by the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for TC/T2T versus UC. RESULTS: 160 patients were included (80/group). Mean (SD) age was 37.9 (11.0) years and disease duration was 3.7 (6.2) years; 51.2% were men. ASDAS at inclusion was 3.0 (0.7), and ASAS-HI was 8.6 (3.7). ASAS-HI improved by ≥30% in 47.3% of the TC/T2T arm and in 36.1% of those receiving UC (non-significant). All secondary efficacy outcomes were more frequent in the TC/T2T arm, although not all statistically significant. Safety was similar in both arms. From a societal perspective, TC/T2T resulted in an additional 0.04 QALY, and saved €472 compared with UC.

34143,Clinical and cost effectiveness of arthritis gloves in rheumatoid arthritis (A-GLOVES): randomised controlled trial with economic analysis,"BACKGROUND: Arthritis (or compression) gloves are widely prescribed to people with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of hand arthritis. They are prescribed for daytime wear to reduce hand pain and improve hand function, and/or night-time wear to reduce pain, improve sleep and reduce morning stiffness. However, evidence for their effectiveness is limited. The aims of this study were to investigate the clinical and cost effectiveness of arthritis gloves compared to placebo gloves on hand pain, stiffness and function in people with rheumatoid arthritis and persistent hand pain. METHODS: A parallel randomised controlled trial, in adults (= 18?years) with rheumatoid or undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis at 16 National Health Service sites in the UK. Patients with persistent hand pain affecting function and/or sleep were eligible. Randomisation (1:1) was stratified by recent change (or not) in medication, using permuted blocks of random sizes. Three-quarter-finger length arthritis gloves (Isotoner®: applying 23-32?mmHg pressure) (intervention) were compared to loose-fitting placebo gloves (Jobskin® classic: providing no/minimal pressure) (control). Both gloves (considered to have similar thermal qualities) were provided by occupational therapists. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded; clinicians were not. The primary outcome was dominant hand pain on activity (0-10) at 12?weeks, analysed using linear regression and intention to treat principles. RESULTS: Two hundred six participants were randomly assigned (103 per arm) and 163 (84 intervention: 79 control) completed 12-week follow-up. Hand pain improved by 1.0 (intervention) and 1.2 (control), an adjusted mean difference of 0.10 (95%?CI: -?0.47 to 0.67; p = 0.72). Adverse events were reported by 51% of intervention and 36% of control group participants; with 6 and 7% respectively, discontinuing glove wear. Provision of arthritis gloves cost £129, with no additional benefit. CONCLUSION: The trial provides evidence of no clinically important effect of arthritis gloves on any of the trial outcomes (hand pain, function and stiffness) and arthritis gloves are not cost-effective. The clinical and cost-effectiveness results support ceasing provision of arthritis gloves in routine clinical practice. FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research.

This cost-effectiveness analysis aimed to use the Markov model to compare immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in age-stratified patients with SAA. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model compared IST with HSCT in age-stratified patients with SAA. Baseline data were derived from a systematic literature review and collected from Huashan Hospital, Fudan University. The primary outcome was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The HSCT strategy dominated in patients aged 18-35 even though it was $146,970 more expensive than IST, and the ICER of HSCT to IST was $14,054.19/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), which was less than the willingness-to-pay value of $25,397.57/QALY. The IST strategy dominated in patients aged 35-50, because it was $72,009 less expensive than HSCT and yielded 3.24 QALYs more than HSCT. The model was vigorous in the sensitivity analyses of the key variables tested through the plausible ranges that were acquired from costing sources and previously published literature.

Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the influence of compliance, prevalence, technological performance, medical cost and annual cost discount rate (3.5%) on ICER. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis evaluated the probability of the cost-effectiveness of C-CRCSP at different maximum acceptable ceiling ratios. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, the C-CRCSP resulted in total gains of 7840 QALYs and 2210 life-years (LY), at a total cost of CNY 58.54 million; that is, the ICER were CNY 7460/QALYs and CNY 26650/LY. Stratifying by residency, the cumulative gains in QALYs and LY were estimated to be the lowest in the urban populations compared with the rural and suburban populations. The cost for the urban population was 3-fold and 6-fold that of the suburban and rural populations. The ICER for QALYs ranged from 2180 (rural) to 16 840 (urban). CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of a C-CRCSP in Shanghai was most favorable for the rural population, while the urban population benefits less in terms of QALYs. ICER could be enhanced by measures that increase compliance.",2021-01-41774,34086400,J Dig Dis,"Li, Xiao Pan",2021,22 / 8,452-462,No,34086400,"Li, Xiao Pan; Chen, Hui Min; Lei, Xiao Hong; Dou, Guan Shen; Chen, Yi Chen; Chen, Li Ping; Yao Zhang; Zhao, Gen Ming; Wei Zhong; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a community-based colorectal cancer screening program in Shanghai, China., J Dig Dis, 2021 Aug; 22(8):; 452-462",QALY,China,Not Stated,Screening,community-based colorectal cancer screening program vs. no screening,Not Stated,74 Years,50 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"25 Years, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,2180,China,2019,334.47
34154,Cost-Effectiveness of Atezolizumab Plus Chemotherapy as First-Line Therapy for Metastatic Urothelial Cancer.,"INTRODUCTION: The IMvigor130 trial found that atezolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (atezolizumab group) as first-line therapy prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC), compared with placebo plus platinum-based chemotherapy (placebo group). The current study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy as first-line therapy for mUC from the US payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was adopted to compare the cost and effectiveness of atezolizumab and placebo group in the first-line setting of patients with mUC. Life years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Subgroup, one-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the model robustness. RESULTS: Atezolizumab group provided an additional 0.39 QALYs (0.52 LYs) and an incremental cost of $170,759 per QALY compared with the placebo group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $434,317 per QALY. Subgroup analysis indicated that PD-L1 expression of at least 5% on immune cells had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $325,236 per QALY. The results of one-way sensitivity analyses suggested that our model was sensitive to the cycle cost of atezolizumab and the hazard ratio of PFS. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed that there was 0% probability of the atezolizumab group being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per QALY. The extrapolations need to be validated by real-world data. CONCLUSIONS: From the US payer perspective, atezolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy is not cost-effective in the first-line therapy for patients with mUC on the basis of a WTP threshold of $150,000 per QALY. On the basis of the value standpoint, price reduction of atezolizumab is expected to improve the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab in patients with mUC.",2021-01-41773,34019245,Adv Ther,Shuxia Qin,2021,38 / 6,3399-3408,No,34019245,"Shuxia Qin; Lidan Yi; Sini Li; Chongqing Tan; Xiaohui Zeng; Liting Wang; Ye Peng; Xiaomin Wan; Cost-Effectiveness of Atezolizumab Plus Chemotherapy as First-Line Therapy for Metastatic Urothelial Cancer., Adv Ther, 2021 Jun; 38(6):; 3399-3408",QALY,China,Malignant neoplasms of urinary tract,Pharmaceutical,"atezolizumab, gemcitabine, and cisplatin or carboplatin vs. placebo + gemcitabine, and cisplatin or carboplatin",untreated patients,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,434317,United States,2021,434317
34155,"Clinical Benefit, Harm, and Cost Effectiveness of Screening Men for Peripheral Artery Disease: A Markov Model Based on the VIVA Trial.","OBJECTIVE: Although screening for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) seems obvious due to its two to three times increased mortality, high prevalence in the elderly, ease of detection, and relatively harmless prevention, the evidence is sparse. METHODS: A Markov decision model was created to model the lifetime effectiveness and cost effectiveness of general population PAD screening and relevant intervention in 65 year old men. The model was informed by original estimates from the VIVA trial data except for ankle brachial systolic blood pressure index test accuracy, quality of life, and background mortality, which were adopted from the literature. A Markov model was designed for 65 year old men, who were distributed in the starting states of no/detected/undetected PAD. The main outcomes were life years, quality adjusted life years, and costs of healthcare. RESULTS: Screening for PAD reduced the rates of amputations and stroke by 10.9% and 2.4%, respectively, while it increased the rates of revascularisation, acute myocardial infarction, and major bleeding by 5.5%, 7.1%, and 4.3% respectively. The overall life expectancy was increased by 14 days per invited subject. The cost per life year/quality adjusted life year was estimated at €16 717/€20 673. On the addition of low dose rivaroxaban reduced the costs per life year gained by 40%. If the model ran for only five follow up years, screening reduced relative mortality by 1.71%, suggesting PAD screening accounts for one fourth of the reported overall 7% relative mortality risk reduction of combined abdominal aortic aneurysm, PAD, and hypertension screening. CONCLUSION: Screening of men for PAD is likely to be both clinically effective and cost effective in a lifetime perspective.",2021-01-41770,33846075,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,Jes Lindholt,2021,61 / 6,971-979,No,33846075,"Jes Lindholt; Rikke Søgaard; Clinical Benefit, Harm, and Cost Effectiveness of Screening Men for Peripheral Artery Disease: A Markov Model Based on the VIVA Trial., Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg, 2021 Jun; 61(6):; 971-979",QALY,Denmark,"Diseases of arteries, arterioles and capillaries",Screening,peripheral artery disease screening vs. no screening,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,20673,Euro,2019,24543.42
34156,The real-world cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for the treatment of severe obesity: a cost-utility analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Severe obesity is associated with adverse health outcomes and increased risk of death. This study evaluates the real-world cost-utility of therapy for severe obesity, from the publicly funded health care system and societal perspectives. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using primary data from a prospective observational cohort of adults living with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m(2) and a major medical comorbidity or BMI ≥ 40 kg/m(2)) who were enrolled in a regional obesity program over 2 years. We extrapolated 10-year and lifetime Markov models, validated and supplemented with literature sources, to compare medical, surgical and standard care therapies. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The cohort included 500 adults living with severe obesity, 150 of whom received laparoscopic surgical therapy. From a publicly funded health system perspective, at 2 years, surgical therapy had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $54 456 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with standard care therapy. Over a lifetime, it had an ICER of $14 056 per QALY. From the societal perspective, at 2 years, surgical therapy had an ICER of $340 per QALY; over a lifetime, it was the dominant option. The results were robust to sensitivity analysis. INTERPRETATION: From a public health care perspective, surgery for severe obesity is cost effective, and when approached from a societal perspective, it becomes cost saving.

34161,Cost Effectiveness of Cochlear Implantation in Single-Sided Deafness.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost effectiveness of cochlear implantation (CI) for the treatment of single-sided deafness (SSD). STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis in an adapted Markov model. SETTING: Adults with single-sided deafness in a high-income country. INTERVENTION: Unilateral CI was compared with no intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were compared with different cost-effectiveness thresholds ($10,000 to $150,000) for different age, sex, and cost combinations. The calculations were based on the quality-adjusted life year (QALY), national life expectancy tables, and different cost settings. The health utility values for the QALY were either directly collected from published data, or, derived from published data using a regression model of multiple utility indices (regression estimate). RESULTS: The regression estimate showed an increase of the health utility value from 0.62 to 0.74 for SSD patients who underwent CI. CI for SSD was cost effective for women up to 64 years ($50,000 per-QALY threshold), 80 years ($100,000 per-QALY threshold), and 86 years ($150,000 per-QALY threshold).

34166,Cost Effectiveness of Cochlear Implantation in Single-Sided Deafness.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost effectiveness of cochlear implantation (CI) for the treatment of single-sided deafness (SSD). STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis in an adapted Markov model. SETTING: Adults with single-sided deafness in a high-income country. INTERVENTION: Unilateral CI was compared with no intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were compared with different cost-effectiveness thresholds ($10,000 to $150,000) for different age, sex, and cost combinations. The calculations were based on the quality-adjusted life year (QALY), national life expectancy tables, and different cost settings. The health utility values for the QALY were either directly collected from published data, or, derived from published data using a regression model of multiple utility indices (regression estimate). RESULTS: The regression estimate showed an increase of the health utility value from 0.62 to 0.74 for SSD patients who underwent CI. CI for SSD was cost effective for women up to 64 years ($50,000 per-QALY threshold), 80 years ($100,000 per-QALY threshold), and 86 years ($150,000 per-QALY threshold).

34179,Cost Effectiveness of Cochlear Implantation in Single-Sided Deafness.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost effectiveness of cochlear implantation (CI) for the treatment of single-sided deafness (SSD). STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis in an adapted Markov model. SETTING: Adults with single-sided deafness in a high-income country. INTERVENTION: Unilateral CI was compared with no intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were compared with different cost-effectiveness thresholds ($10,000 to $150,000) for different age, sex, and cost combinations. The calculations were based on the quality-adjusted life year (QALY), national life expectancy tables, and different cost settings. The health utility values for the QALY were either directly collected from published data, or, derived from published data using a regression model of multiple utility indices (regression estimate). RESULTS: The regression estimate showed an increase of the health utility value from 0.62 to 0.74 for SSD patients who underwent CI. CI for SSD was cost effective for women up to 64 years ($50,000 per-QALY threshold), 80 years ($100,000 per-QALY threshold), and 86 years ($150,000 per-QALY threshold). For men, these values were 58, 77, and 84, respectively. Changing the discount rate by up to 5% further increased the cutoff ages up to 5 years.

34189,Cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in chronic heart failure: an analysis from the Australian healthcare perspective.,"AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in addition to standard care versus standard care alone in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure trial to assess the clinical outcomes and costs of 1000 hypothetical subjects with established heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. The model consisted of three health states: 'alive and event-free', 'alive after non-fatal hospitalisation for heart failure' and 'dead'. Costs and utilities were estimated from published sources. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year gained. An Australian public healthcare perspective was employed. All outcomes and costs were discounted at a rate of 5% annually. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, the addition of dapagliflozin to standard care in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction prevented 88 acute heart failure hospitalisations (including readmissions) and yielded an additional 416 years of life and 288 quality-adjusted life-years (discounted) at an additional cost of A$3,692,440 (discounted). This equated to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A$12,482 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, well below the Australian willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Subanalyses in subjects with and without diabetes resulted in similar incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of A$13,234 and A$12,386 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin is likely to be cost-effective when used as an adjunct therapy to standard care compared with standard care alone for the treatment of chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.",2021-01-41725,34402872,Eur J Prev Cardiol,Feby Savira,2021,28 / 9,975-982,No,34402872,"Feby Savira; Bing Wang; Andrew Kompa; Zanfina Ademi; Alice Owen; Sophia Zoungas; Andrew Tonkin; Danny Liew; Ella Zomer; Cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in chronic heart failure: an analysis from the Australian healthcare perspective., Eur J Prev Cardiol, 2021 Aug 9; 28(9):; 975-982",QALY,Australia,Other forms of heart disease,Pharmaceutical,dapagliflozin + standard of care vs. standard care only,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",5.00,5.00,12842,Australia,2020,9292.64
34190,The Cost-Effectiveness of a COVID-19 Vaccine in a Danish Context.,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Covid-19 vaccines approved by the EU, UK and USA have been found to be safe and effective. The cost effectiveness of these vaccines depends upon a number of factors. The aim of this paper is to explore the cost effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine and to analyse how the price of the vaccine and the cost of administrating it influence its cost effectiveness. METHODS: We considered an epidemiological model developed by an expert group within 'Statens Serum Institut', which is a unit under the auspices of the Danish Ministry of Health. The model allowed us to differentiate between two population groups, those aged ≥60 years and those aged <60 years. We used the model to consider four scenarios: (i) vaccination of 25% of the total population (corresponding to approximately 1.5 million persons) but targeting vaccines towards the population aged ≥60 years, (ii) vaccination of 25% of the total population, targeting vaccines only towards the population aged <60 years, (iii) vaccination of 40% of the total population where 15% are aged <60 years and 25% are aged ≥60 years (corresponding approximately to the full Danish population aged >60 years), and (iv) 40% of the total population is vaccinated but vaccines are targeted solely towards those aged <60 years. The time horizon of the analysis was six months, and the perspective was that of the Danish healthcare sector. RESULTS: The results show that inclusion of the elderly population aged ≥60 years was more cost effective than a vaccination strategy that targeted a population aged <60 years old only, when productivity losses were not included. Furthermore, the results show that an extension of the target group from the elderly population only, to also include the younger population comes with an increasing cost per life-year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio depends on the price of the vaccine, hereunder also the administration costs, and the discount rate used for the estimation of life-years or quality-adjusted life-years gained from a vaccine. Furthermore, inclusion of productivity losses in the analyses influenced the cost effectiveness of vaccination of the population aged <60 years of age. CONCLUSION: The cost effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine is sensitive to whether or not productivity losses are included in the analyses. Without productivity losses, the elderly population should always be part of the target group for a COVID-19 vaccination programme. Taking productivity losses into account, at least in the case of low vaccine prices, vaccinating the younger population first can actually be cost effective.",2021-01-41652,34623627,Clin Drug Investig,Kristian Debrabant,2021,41 / 11,975-988,No,34623627,"Kristian Debrabant; Lone Grønbæk; Christian Kronborg; The Cost-Effectiveness of a COVID-19 Vaccine in a Danish Context., Clin Drug Investig, 2021 Nov; 41(11):; 975-988",QALY,Denmark,Provisional assignment of new diseases of uncertain etiology or emergency use,Immunization,COVID-19 immunization vs. No COVID-19 vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,0 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"6 Months, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,-43.59,Denmark,2020,-6.97
34191,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Pharmacist-Led Medication Therapy Management Program: Hypertension Management.,"OBJECTIVES: Uncontrolled hypertension is a common cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the deadliest and costliest chronic disease in the United States. Pharmacists are an accessible community healthcare resource and are equipped with clinical skills to improve the management of hypertension through medication therapy management (MTM). Nevertheless, current reimbursement models do not incentivize pharmacists to provide clinical services. We aim to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a pharmacist-led comprehensive MTM clinic compared with no clinic for 10-year primary prevention of stroke and cardiovascular disease events in patients with hypertension. METHODS: We built a semi-Markov model to evaluate the clinical and economic consequences of an MTM clinic compared with no MTM clinic, from the payer perspective. The model was populated with data from a recently published controlled observational study investigating the effectiveness of an MTM clinic. Methodology was guided using recommendations from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, including appropriate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with no MTM clinic, the MTM clinic was cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $38 798 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The incremental net monetary benefit was $993 294 considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY.

34192,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Michigan's School-Wide Sexually Transmitted Disease Screening Program in Four Detroit High Schools.,"PURPOSE: The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with St. John Providence Health System, initiated voluntary school-wide sexually transmitted disease (STD) screenings in four Detroit public high schools. We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of the STD screening program from 2010 to 2015, with a focus on chlamydia. METHODS: The costs and effectiveness of the school-based screening were compared with those of a ""no school screening"" scenario using a healthcare system perspective. A decision tree model was constructed to project cases of chlamydia, epididymitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in each of the two scenarios among students tested positive and their partners. Health effects were measured as cases of PID prevented, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Cost estimates included program costs, chlamydia testing/treatment costs in the absence of school screening, and treatment costs for epididymitis, PID, and PID sequelae. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured as cost/QALY gained. Multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted on key parameter estimates and assumptions used. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, at a total program cost of $333,848 over 5 years, the program prevented an estimated 1.9 cases of epididymitis and 17.3 cases of PID, resulting in an ICER of $38,235/QALY gained (yearly ICER ranging from $27,417 to $50,945/QALY). Of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulation runs, the yearly ICER remained ≤$50,000/QALY in 64%-98% of the simulation runs.

34197,Economic evaluation of patient direct access to NHS physiotherapy services.,"OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to undertake an economic evaluation of patient direct access to physiotherapy in the UK NHS by comparing the number of patients treated, waiting time, cost and health gain from a direct access pathway versus traditional GP-referral to NHS physiotherapy. DESIGN: The authors used a discrete event simulation (DES) model to represent a hypothetical GP practice of 10,000 patients. Costs were measured from the perspective of the NHS and society. Outcomes were predicted waiting times, the total number of patients with musculoskeletal conditions who received physiotherapy and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, each estimated over a one year period. Model inputs were based on a pilot cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in four general practices in Cheshire, UK, and other sources from the literature. RESULTS: Direct access could increase the number of patients receiving at least one physiotherapy appointment by 63%, but without investment in extra physiotherapist capacity would increase waiting time dramatically. The increase in activity is associated with a cost of £4999 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Direct access to physiotherapy services would be cost-effective and benefit patients given current cost per QALY thresholds used in England. This is because physiotherapy itself is cost-effective, rather than through savings in GP time. Direct access without an increase in supply of physiotherapists would increase waiting times and would be unlikely to be cost saving for the NHS owing to the likely increase in the use of physiotherapy services.",2021-01-41763,33785196,Physiotherapy,Miaoqing Yang,2021,111 /,40-47,No,33785196,"Miaoqing Yang; Annette Bishop; Jon Sussex; Martin Roland; Sue Jowett; Edward Wilson; Economic evaluation of patient direct access to NHS physiotherapy services., Physiotherapy, 2021 Jun; 111():; 40-47",QALY,United Kingdom,Symptoms and signs involving the nervous and musculoskeletal systems,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior",self referral to physiotherapy services vs. traditional general medical practitioners referral to physiotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"1 Year, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,-22500,United Kingdom,2019,-30451.88
34198,The cost-effectiveness of icosapent ethyl in combination with statin therapy compared with statin alone for cardiovascular risk reduction.,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness, from the perspective of the Australian public healthcare system, of icosapent ethyl in combination with statin therapy compared with statin alone for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model populated with data from the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial was designed to predict the effectiveness and costs of icosapent ethyl in combination with statins compared with statins alone over a 20-year time horizon. Data inputs for costs and utilities were sourced from published sources. The annual costs of icosapent ethyl were assumed to be AUD1637 (USD2907) per person. All future costs and outcomes were discounted annually by 5%. The main outcome of interest was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and per year of life saved (YoLS). Over a 20-year time horizon, compared with statin alone, icosapent ethyl in combination with statin was estimated to cost an additional AUD$13,022 per person, but led to 0.338 YoLS and 0.289 QALYs gained (all discounted). These equated to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of AUD45,036 per QALY gained and AUD38,480 per YoLS. Sub-analyses for primary and secondary prevention were AUD96,136 and AUD35,935 per QALY gained, respectively. The results were sensitive to time-horizon, age related trends and the acquisition price of icosapent ethyl. CONCLUSION: Compared with statin alone, icosapent ethyl in combination with statin therapy is likely to be cost-effective in the prevention of cardiovascular disease assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of AUD50,000 per QALY gained, especially in the secondary preventive setting.",2021-01-41762,34298556,Eur J Prev Cardiol,Zanfina Ademi,2021,28 / 8,897-904,No,34298556,"Zanfina Ademi; Richard Ofori-Asenso; Ella Zomer; Alice Owen; Danny Liew; The cost-effectiveness of icosapent ethyl in combination with statin therapy compared with statin alone for cardiovascular risk reduction., Eur J Prev Cardiol, 2021 Jul 23; 28(8):; 897-904",QALY,Australia,Other forms of heart disease,Pharmaceutical,icosapent ethyl + statin vs. statin,"elevated triglycerides despite statin therapy, >_50 years with diabetes and at least one additional risk factor",Not Stated,45 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"20 Years, Not Stated / None",5.00,5.00,45039,Australia,2019,33194.09

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of the CDMP in patients with hypertension from the perspective of the healthcare payer. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed based on a Markov simulation model. The cost and effect of the CDMP versus usual care was compared in individuals aged 40 years or above. The two strategies were presumed to result in a difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. The model was analyzed over the lifetime of the cohort. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the difference in lifetime costs by the difference in lifetime effects (quality adjusted life years, QALYs) between the two strategies. Costs were expressed in Korean Won (KRW). RESULTS: The ICER value of the CDMP participation strategy was -5 761 088 KRW/QALY compared to usual care. Similar tendencies were found when limiting the population to only clinic users (-3 843 355 KRW/QALY) and national health examination participants (-5 595 185 KRW/QALY).
