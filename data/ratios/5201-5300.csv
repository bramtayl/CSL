5201,Sixty-four-slice computed tomography of the coronary arteries: cost-effectiveness analysis of patients presenting to the emergency department with low-risk chest pain,"OBJECTIVES: The aim was to use a computer model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 64-slice multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) of the coronary arteries in the emergency department (ED) compared to an observation unit (OU) stay plus stress electrocardiogram (ECG) or stress echocardiography for the evaluation of low-risk chest pain patients presenting to the ED. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed to compare health outcomes and costs that result from three different risk stratification strategies for low-risk chest pain patients in the ED: stress ECG testing after OU care, stress echocardiography after OU care, and MDCT with no OU care. Three patient populations were modeled with the prevalence of symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) being very low risk, 2%; low risk, 6% (base case); and moderate risk, 10%. Outcomes were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), the ratio of change in costs of one test over another to the change in QALY, were calculated for comparisons between each strategy. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results to assumptions regarding the characteristics of the risk stratification strategies, costs, utility weights, and likelihood of events. RESULTS: In the base case, the mean (+/- standard deviation [SD]) costs and QALYs for each risk stratification strategy were MDCT arm $2,684 (+/- $1,773 to $4,418) and 24.69 (+/- 24.54 to 24.76) QALYs, stress echocardiography arm $3,265 (+/- $2,383 to $4,836) and 24.63 (+/- 24.28 to 24.74) QALYs, and stress ECG arm $3,461 (+/- $2,533 to $4,996) and 24.59 (+/- 24.21 to 24.75) QALYs. The MDCT dominated (less costly and more effective) both OU plus stress echocardiography and OU plus stress ECG. This resulted in an ICER where the MDCT arm dominated the stress echocardiography arm (95% confidence interval [CI] = dominant to $29,738) and where MDCT dominated the ECG arm (95% CI = dominant to $7,332). The MDCT risk stratification arm also dominated stress echocardiography and stress ECG in the 2 and 10% prevalence scenarios, which demonstrated the same ICER trends as the 6% prevalence CAD base case. The thresholds where the MDCT arm remained a cost-saving strategy compared to the other risk stratification strategies were cost of MDCT, < $2,097; cost of OU care, > $1,092; prevalence of CAD, < 70%; MDCT specificity, > 65%; and a MDCT indeterminate rate, < 30%. CONCLUSIONS: In this computer-based model analysis, the MDCT risk stratification strategy is less costly and more effective than both OU-based stress echocardiography and stress ECG risk stratification strategies in chest pain patients presenting to the ED with low to moderate prevalence of CAD.",2008-01-04276,19086322,Acad Emerg Med,Rahul K Khare,2008,15 / 7,623-32,No,19086322,"Rahul K Khare; D Mark Courtney; Emilie S Powell; Arjun K Venkatesh; Todd A Lee; Sixty-four-slice computed tomography of the coronary arteries: cost-effectiveness analysis of patients presenting to the emergency department with low-risk chest pain, Acad Emerg Med, 2008-Jul; 15(7):1069-6563; 623-32",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Multidetector computed tomography vs. Echocardiogram,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-9683.33,United States,2007,-12087.05

OBJECTIVE: To assess the short-term cost-effectiveness of spine surgery relative to nonoperative care for stenosis alone and for stenosis with spondylolisthesis. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. DATA SOURCES: Resource utilization, productivity, and EuroQol EQ-5D score measured at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after treatment among SPORT participants. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with image-confirmed spinal stenosis, with and without degenerative spondylolisthesis. Time Horizon: 2 years. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Nonoperative care or surgery (primarily decompressive laminectomy for stenosis and decompressive laminectomy with fusion for stenosis associated with degenerative spondylolisthesis). OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Among 634 patients with stenosis, 394 (62%) had surgery, most often decompressive laminectomy (320 of 394 [81%]). Stenosis surgeries improved health to a greater extent than nonoperative care (QALY gain, 0.17 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.22]) at a cost of $77,600 (CI, $49,600 to $120,000) per QALY gained. Among 601 patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis, 368 (61%) had surgery, most including fusion (344 of 368 [93%]) and most with instrumentation (269 of 344 [78%]). Degenerative spondylolisthesis surgeries significantly improved health versus nonoperative care (QALY gain, 0.23 [CI, 0.19 to 0.27]), at a cost of $115,600 (CI, $90,800 to $144,900) per QALY gained. RESULT OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Surgery cost markedly affected the value of surgery. LIMITATION: The study used self-reported utilization data, 2-year time horizon, and as-treated analysis to address treatment nonadherence among randomly assigned participants. CONCLUSION: The economic value of spinal stenosis surgery at 2 years compares favorably with many health interventions.

DESIGN: Cost consequences study and cost effectiveness analysis at 12 month follow-up of a factorial randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: 579 patients with chronic or recurrent low back pain recruited from primary care. INTERVENTIONS: Normal care (control), massage, and six or 24 lessons in the Alexander technique. Half of each group were randomised to a prescription for exercise from a doctor plus behavioural counselling from a nurse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs to the NHS and to participants. Comparison of costs with Roland-Morris disability score (number of activities impaired by pain), days in pain, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Comparison of NHS costs with QALY gain, using incremental cost effectiveness ratios and cost effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Intervention costs ranged from pound30 for exercise prescription to pound596 for 24 lessons in Alexander technique plus exercise. Cost of health services ranged from pound50 for 24 lessons in Alexander technique to pound124 for exercise. Incremental cost effectiveness analysis of single therapies showed that exercise offered best value ( pound61 per point on disability score, pound9 per additional pain-free day, pound2847 per QALY gain).

5215,Cost-effectiveness analysis of sunitinib in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stroma tumours (GIST) after progression or intolerance with imatinib,"INTRODUCTION: Sunitinib is a multiselective oral inhibitor of several tyrosine-kinase receptors that has demonstrated its efficacy in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stroma tumours (GIST) who were resistant to or intolerant to previous treatment with imatinib. The purpose of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of sunitinib vs. best supportive care (BSC) in GIST as a second- line treatment, from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to assess the cost effectiveness of sunitinib (50 mg/day, 4 weeks ""on"" and 2 weeks ""off"") vs. BSC in GIST as a second-line treatment. Transition probabilities between the three health states considered in the model (progression-free survival (PFS), progression and death) were obtained from a clinical trial [Demetri et al. (2006) Lancet 368:1329-1338]. Health resource data (drugs, medical visits, laboratory and radiology tests, palliative care and adverse events) were obtained from an expert panel. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Projected PFS years, life years (LY) and quality of life adjusted years (QALYs) were higher for sunitinib compared with BSC: 0.50 vs. 0.24, 1.59 vs. 0.88 and 1.00 vs. 0.55. Mean costs per patient were 23,259 euros with sunitinib and 1,622 euros with BSC. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) obtained were: 4,090 euros/month PFS, 30,242 euros/LY and 49,090 euros/QALY gained. The most influential variables for the results were the efficacy and unit cost of sunitinib. CONCLUSIONS: According to the efficiency thresholds for oncology patients in developed countries, sunitinib is considered cost-effective vs. BSC with acceptable costs per LY and QALY gained.",2008-01-04292,19068454,Clin Transl Oncol,Luis Paz-Ares,2008,10 / 12,831-9,No,19068454,"Luis Paz-Ares; Xavier García del Muro; Enrique Grande; Paloma González; M Brosa; Silvia Díaz; Cost-effectiveness analysis of sunitinib in patients with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stroma tumours (GIST) after progression or intolerance with imatinib, Clin Transl Oncol, 2008-Dec; 10(12):1699-048X; 831-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Sunitinib (50 mg/day, 4 weeks on and two weeks off) vs. Best supportive care",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Years,3.50,3.50,49090,Euro,2007,84012.88
5216,Cost-effectiveness of new cardiac and vascular rehabilitation strategies for patients with coronary artery disease,"OBJECTIVE: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) often hinders the cardiac rehabilitation program. The aim of this study was evaluating the relative cost-effectiveness of new rehabilitation strategies which include the diagnosis and treatment of PAD in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing cardiac rehabilitation. DATA SOURCES: Best-available evidence was retrieved from literature and combined with primary data from 231 patients. METHODS: We developed a markov decision model to compare the following treatment strategies: 1. cardiac rehabilitation only; 2. ankle-brachial index (ABI) if cardiac rehabilitation fails followed by diagnostic work-up and revascularization for PAD if needed; 3. ABI prior to cardiac rehabilitation followed by diagnostic work-up and revascularization for PAD if needed. Quality-adjusted-life years (QALYs), life-time costs (US $), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), and gain in net health benefits (NHB) in QALY equivalents were calculated. A threshold willingness-to-pay of $75,000 was used. RESULTS: ABI if cardiac rehabilitation fails was the most favorable strategy with an ICER of $44,251 per QALY gained and an incremental NHB compared to cardiac rehabilitation only of 0.03 QALYs (95% CI: -0.17, 0.29) at a threshold willingness-to-pay of $75,000/QALY. After sensitivity analysis, a combined cardiac and vascular rehabilitation program increased the success rate and would dominate the other two strategies with total lifetime costs of $30,246 a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 3.84 years, and an incremental NHB of 0.06 QALYs (95%CI:-0.24, 0.46) compared to current practice.

5219,An evidence-based model comparing the cost-effectiveness of platelet-rich plasma gel to alternative therapies for patients with nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers,"OBJECTIVE: A cost-effectiveness analysis compared the potential economic benefit of an autologous, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) gel to alternative therapies in treating nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers. DESIGN: An economic model used peer-reviewed data to simulate clinical and cost outcomes and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with PRP gel and other treatment modalities. PATIENTS: The model varies rates of healing, recurrence, infection, amputation, death, and associated costs for a hypothetical group of 200,000 patients with full-thickness, nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers for 5 years or until death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The model simulates the clinical, cost, and QALY outcomes associated with PRP gel versus other modalities in treating nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers over a 5-year period. MAIN RESULTS: The average 5-year direct wound care cost per modality and QALYs were PRP gel, $15,159 (2.87); saline gel, $33,214 (2.70); standard of care, $40,073 (2.65); noncontact kilohertz ultrasound therapy, $32,659 (2.73); human fibroblast-derived dermal substitute, $40,569 (2.65); allogenic bilayered culture skin substitute, $24,374 (2.79); bilayered cellular matrix, $37,340 (2.71); negative pressure wound therapy, $20,964 (2.81); and recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor BB, $47,252 (2.69). CONCLUSION: Use of PRP gel resulted in improved quality of life and lower cost of care over a 5-year period than other treatment modalities for nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers.

5227,Costs associated with ventricular assist device use in children,"BACKGROUND: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) allow children with severe heart failure to be bridged to successful heart transplantation. Ventricular assist devices are being used with increasing frequency in the pediatric population, and newer devices allow even young infants to be supported. Ventricular assist device implantation and maintenance, however, is quite expensive, and the cost-effectiveness of VAD use in adults has been questioned. To date, an economic analysis of VAD support in children has not been undertaken. METHODS: We used Pediatric Health Information System, an administrative database of the Child Health Corporation of America (a consortium of Children's Hospitals in North America), to determine the outcomes and costs related to VAD use in children. Data on patients younger than 18 years of age from 2002 to 2007 were reviewed. Hospital charges were converted to costs based on cost-to-charge ratios. Projected survival for subjects who were successfully bridged to heart transplant was derived from published data. The model assumed that if a VAD strategy were not used, the majority of subjects would have required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support as a bridge to transplantation. Cost-utility was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life years saved. All future costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: There were 145 children who underwent VAD implantation at 19 centers in North America. The median age at admission was 8.5 years; the range was newborn to 17.7 years. The median duration of VAD support was 43 days (range, 1 to 465 days). Ninety-four patients (65%) survived to heart transplantation. Thirty-nine (27%) patients died during hospitalization. There were 12 patients (8%) who had VAD explantation and survival to hospital discharge. The mean hospital cost was $624,798. When compared with a strategy of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, the calculated cost-utility for VAD as a bridge to transplantation was $119,937 per quality-adjusted life year saved. When key assumptions were changed, the cost-utility varied from $88,304 to $282,320 per quality-adjusted life year saved. CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular assist devices allow an effective bridge to heart transplantation in children. Under base-case assumptions, the cost-effectiveness ratios exceed the threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved. The cost-utility of this strategy, however, is comparable to a number of other life-saving technologies.",2008-01-04310,19049755,Ann Thorac Surg,William T Mahle,2008,86 / 5,1592-7,No,19049755,"William T Mahle; Glenn Ianucci; Robert N Vincent; Kirk R Kanter; Costs associated with ventricular assist device use in children, Ann Thorac Surg, 2008-Nov; 86(5):0003-4975; 1592-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ventricular assist devices to bridge to successful heart transplantation vs. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support to bridge to successful heart transplantation,Not Stated,17 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,119937,United States,2007,149709.25
5228,The cost-effectiveness of increasing alcohol taxes: a modelling study,"BACKGROUND: Excessive alcohol use increases risks of chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease and several types of cancer, with associated losses of quality of life and life-years. Alcohol taxes can be considered as a public health instrument as they are known to be able to decrease alcohol consumption. In this paper, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of an alcohol tax increase for the entire Dutch population from a health-care perspective focusing on health benefits and health-care costs in alcohol users. METHODS: The chronic disease model of the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment was used to extrapolate from decreased alcohol consumption due to tax increases to effects on health-care costs, life-years gained and quality-adjusted life-years gained, A Dutch scenario in which tax increases for beer are planned, and a Swedish scenario representing one of the highest alcohol taxes in Europe, were compared with current practice in the Netherlands. To estimate cost-effectiveness ratios, yearly differences in model outcomes between intervention and current practice scenarios were discounted and added over the time horizon of 100 years to find net present values for incremental life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and health-care costs. RESULTS: In the Swedish scenario, many more quality-adjusted life-years were gained than in the Dutch scenario, but both scenarios had almost equal incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: 5100 euros per quality-adjusted life-year and 5300 euros per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively.

An albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) was developed to provide additional efficacy and to overcome the safety drawbacks of paclitaxel and docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer. To provide health economic data for the Canadian setting, an economic analysis comparing each of nab-paclitaxel and docetaxel, both as alternatives to paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer was conducted. METHODS: /B>. The clinical and safety data were obtained from a meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing either nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m(2) q3wk) or docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) q3wk), to standard paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) q3wk). Health care resource use for the delivery of chemotherapy and the management of grade III/IV toxicity was collected from the oncology literature. Treatment preferences and health state utilities were obtained from 24 female oncology nurses and pharmacists using the time trade-off technique. RESULTS: /B>. Nab-paclitaxel had the lowest incidence of grade III/IV toxicity. This translated to lower overall costs for managing the grade III/IV events relative to both docetaxel and paclitaxel ($597 vs. $2626 vs. $1227). Using the median number of cycles administered and the cost impact of grade III/IV toxicity, the overall cost for nab-paclitaxel would be $15,105 compared to $15,268 for docetaxel and $3557 for paclitaxel. When treatment preferences were assessed, 20 of 24 (83.3%) respondents selected nab-paclitaxel as their preferred choice compared to only 4 who selected docetaxel. These corresponded to a gain of 0.203 and 0.016 QALYs for nab-paclitaxel and docetaxel, respectively. With these utility benefits, the incremental cost per QALY gained was more favorable for nab-paclitaxel than docetaxel ($56,800 vs. $739,600). CONCLUSIONS: /B>.

5232,Cost-utility of breast reduction surgery - A prospective study,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-utility of routine breast-reduction surgery in the setting of a large university hospital. METHODS: In the framework of a large trial exploring the feasibility of routine health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment, 80 patients (mean age: 45 years) entering the Department of Plastic Surgery for operative breast reduction filled in the 15-dimension (15D) HRQoL survey before and 6 months after surgery. Data on hospital costs were obtained from the hospital records. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) HRQoL score (on a 0-1 scale) increased as a result of surgery from the preoperative 0.916+/-0.075 to 0.939+/-0.076 (p<0.001) 6 months after surgery, corresponding to a mean (+/-SD) gain of 0.930+/-2.117 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Of the 15 health dimensions, discomfort and symptoms showed the greatest improvement (p<0.001). A statistically significant improvement was also seen on the dimensions of breathing, sleeping and distress. Mean hospital cost of treatment was euro3383+/-1744, and the cost per QALY was euro3638. Using 5% discounting for QALYs, the cost per QALY increased to euro8973.

5233,The long-term cost-effectiveness of fetal monitoring during labour: a comparison of cardiotocography complemented with ST analysis versus cardiotocography alone,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the use of cardiotocography (CTG) complemented with fetal electrocardiography and ST analysis compared with the use of CTG alone in term deliveries when a decision has been made to use fetal monitoring with a scalp electrode. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis based on a probabilistic decision model incorporating relevant strategies and lifelong outcomes. SETTING: Maternity wards in Sweden. POPULATION: Women with term fetuses after a clinical decision had been made to apply a fetal scalp electrode for internal CTG. METHODS: A decision model was used to compare the costs and effects of two different treatment strategies. Baseline estimates were derived from the literature. Discounted costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were simulated over a lifetime horizon using a probabilistic model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: QALYs, incremental costs, and cost per QALY gained expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The analysis found an incremental effect of 0.005 QALYs for ST analysis compared with CTG; the ST analysis strategy was also moreover associated with a euro56 decrease in costs, thus dominating the CTG strategy. The probability that ST analysis is cost-effective in comparison with CTG is high, irrespective of the willingness-to-pay value for a QALY.

5234,The value of newborn urinary proteome analysis in the evaluation and management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction: a cost-effectiveness study,"PURPOSE: The cornerstone of management in newborns with ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is serial imaging over time. Surgery is undertaken for disease progression. A marker of disease progression would select out those likely to progress for early surgery and diminish the intensity of imaging and follow-up in the remainder. Recently, urinary proteome analysis in the newborn has been reported to fulfill this aim. The objective of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the effect of this matrix of protein biomarkers on the overall cost-effectiveness (C-E) of UPJO evaluation and management. METHODS: A Markov process decision tree model (Tree Age Pro software, Boston, MA) is created to compare the current strategy (watchful waiting) to one incorporating a urine proteome analysis at birth as a marker of disease progression. The analysis includes the costs of surgery, imaging and office visits based on hospital charge data. We analyze a total of 53 variables. RESULTS: The incorporation of this marker of progression results on the average, in an incremental C-E gain of $8,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) per patient compared to the current strategy of watchful waiting. The results are not sensitive to variation of any of the probabilities including costs and quality of life parameters used for the base-case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The incorporation of urinary proteome analysis in the initial evaluation of UPJO significantly reduces costs and increases the QALYs in this patient population. The test increases the odds of detecting UPJO progression from 1:3 to 1:1, while improving the overall C-E.

5235,Cost-effectiveness of specific immunotherapy with Grazax in allergic rhinitis co-existing with asthma,"BACKGROUND: In the United Kingdom, approximately 10.8 million people suffer from asthma, placing an economic burden on the society of more than 2 billion pounds sterling per year. For allergic asthma, treatment options consist of allergen avoidance, symptomatic treatment and allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT). Only SIT addresses the underlying cause of the disease, reducing symptoms and offering the potential for long-term improvement. Grazax--the first tablet-based SIT--is indicated for the treatment of patients with grass pollen-induced rhinoconjunctivitis, including those with co-existing asthma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of Grazax in patients with rhinoconjunctivitis and co-existing asthma. METHODS: A prospective pharmacoeconomic analysis was carried out as part of a multinational clinical trial assessing the efficacy of Grazax (n = 79) compared with placebo (n = 72). Both groups had access to symptomatic medication; thus the placebo group represented current standard care. Pooled data on health resource use, productivity loss because of absence from work and quality of life (Quality Adjusted Life Years, QALYs) were collected in the trial. Reduced productivity at work was estimated from the literature. A societal perspective was adopted with a 9-year time horizon. The NHS price of Grazax of 2.25 pounds sterling per tablet was used. RESULTS: The QALY gain was significantly higher for patients treated with Grazax than the placebo group receiving symptomatic medication alone (0.197 discounted QALYs gained 9 years into the future - equal to an extra 72 days of perfect health over 9 years). The levels of resource use and productivity loss were higher for the placebo group. As a result, the cost per QALY gained with Grazax was 4319 pounds sterling , which is highly cost-effective. Price sensitivity analyses demonstrated that Grazax remained cost-effective up to a tablet price of 5.07 pounds sterling . CONCLUSION: SIT with Grazax is a cost-effective strategy compared with standard management of patients with rhinoconjunctivitis and co-existing asthma.",2008-01-04336,19032235,Allergy,S Nasser,2008,63 / 12,1624-9,No,19032235,"S Nasser; U Vestenbaek; A Beriot-Mathiot; P B Poulsen; Cost-effectiveness of specific immunotherapy with Grazax in allergic rhinitis co-existing with asthma, Allergy, 2008-Dec; 63(12):0105-4538; 1624-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Grazax treatment for 3 years beginning 4 months before grass pollen season vs. Usual care: placebo group - taking symptomatic medication alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,9 Years,3.50,3.50,4319,United Kingdom,2005,10418.95
5236,Cost-effectiveness analysis of mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke,"Object Mechanical thrombectomy is increasingly being used for the treatment of large-vessel ischemic stroke in patients who arrive outside of the 3-hour tissue plasminogen activator time window. In this study, the authors evaluated the cost and effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy compared with standard medical therapy in patients who are ineligible to receive tissue plasminogen activator. Methods Clinical outcomes of an open-label study of mechanical thrombectomy were compared with a hypothetical control group with a lower recanalization rate (18 vs 60%) and a lower rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (0.6 vs 7.8%) than the active treatment group. A Markov cost-effectiveness model was built to compare the health benefits and costs associated with mechanical thrombectomy compared with standard medical therapy. All probabilities, quality-of-life factors, and costs were estimated from the published literature. Univariate sensitivity analyses were performed to assess how variations in model parameters affect health and economic outcomes. Results Treatment of acute ischemic stroke with mechanical thrombectomy increased survival time by 0.54 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), compared with standard medical therapy (2.37 vs 1.83 QALYs), at an increased cost of $6600. This yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $12,120 per QALY gained, a value generally considered cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis showed that mechanical thrombectomy remained cost-effective (ICER < $50,000 per QALY gained) for all model inputs varied over a reasonable range, except for age at stroke treatment. For patients older than 82 years of age, the treatment was only borderline cost-effective (ICER of $50,000-100,000 per QALY gained). Conclusions The treatment of large-vessel ischemic stroke with mechanical thrombectomy appears to be costeffective.

Materials and methods: Cost-minimisation and cost-utility analysis were performed. Time horizon of two years. Portuguese National Health System (NHS) perspective was applied. Survival and time to progression were obtained from three clinical trials. Base-case analysis: 2nd or 3rd line patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) were obtained from a UK study. Resource consumption was estimated by a Portuguese panel of experts. Costs were calculated according to official Portuguese databases (updated to 2008). Only direct health costs were applied. Annual discount rate: 5%. Sensitivity analysis included different subpopulations, a three year time horizon and a probabilistic analysis. Results: The cost per patient was lower with erlotinib (euro26 478) than docetaxel (euro29 262) or pemetrexed (euro32 762) and higher than best supportive care (euro16 112). QALYs per patient were higher with erlotinib (0.250) than docetaxel (0.225), pemetrexed (0.241) or best supportive care (0.186).

5240,Economic evaluation of fulvestrant as an extra step in the treatment sequence for ER-positive advanced breast cancer,"Drug therapies for advanced breast cancer in hormone-receptor-positive disease include both hormonal and chemotherapies. Current UK practice is to minimise toxicity by using sequential hormonal agents for as long as clinically appropriate. A Markov model was developed to investigate the cost effectiveness of different sequences of therapies, particularly exploring the effects of adding an additional hormonal agent, fulvestrant, to the treatment pathway. A systematic review was undertaken and a panel of seven UK oncologists validated assumptions used for treatment efficacy, treatment pathways and resources used. Fulvestrant was found to be a cost-effective treatment option when added to the treatment sequence as a second- or third-line hormonal therapy for advanced disease. For a cohort of 1000 patients, fulvestrant as a second-line hormone therapy provided an additional 47 life years and 41 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), at an additional cost of pound 301 359. This equated to pound 6500 per life years gained and pound 7500 per QALY. When used as a third-line option, the fulvestrant arm was dominant providing an increase in health benefit of 27 QALYs for the whole cohort, at a mean overall cost reduction of pound 430 per patient.

5242,Cost-effectiveness of automated telephone self-management support with nurse care management among patients with diabetes,"PURPOSE: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of an automated telephone self-management support with nurse care management (ATSM) intervention for patients with type 2 diabetes, which was tested among patients receiving primary care in publicly funded (safety net) clinics, focusing on non-English speakers. METHODS: We performed cost analyses in the context of a randomized trial among primary care patients comparing the effects of ATSM (n = 112) and usual care (n = 114) on diabetes-related outcomes in 4 San Francisco safety net clinics. ATSM uses interactive phone technology to provide surveillance, patient education, and one-on-one counseling, and was implemented in 3 languages for a 9-month period. Cost utility was examined using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) derived from changes in scores on the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey. We also examined cost-effectiveness for costs associated with a 10% increase in the proportion of patients meeting diabetes-specific public health goals for increasing exercise, as recommended by Healthy People 2010 and the American Diabetes Association. RESULTS: The annual cost of the ATSM intervention per QALY gained, relative to usual care, was $65,167 for start-up and ongoing implementation costs combined, and $32,333 for ongoing implementation costs alone. In sensitivity analyses, costs per QALY ranged from $29,402 to $72,407. The per-patient cost to achieve a 10% increase in the proportion of intervention patients meeting American Diabetes Association exercise guidelines was estimated to be $558 when all costs were considered and $277 when only ongoing costs were considered. CONCLUSIONS: The ATSM intervention for diverse patients with diabetes had a cost utility for functional outcomes similar to that of many other accepted interventions targeted at diabetes prevention and treatment, and achieved public health physical activity objectives at modest costs. Because a considerable proportion of costs were fixed, cost-utility and cost-effectiveness estimates would likely be substantially improved in a scaled-up ATSM program.",2008-01-04373,19001303,Ann Fam Med,Margaret A Handley,2008,6 / 6,512-8,No,19001303,"Margaret A Handley; Martha Shumway; Dean Schillinger; Cost-effectiveness of automated telephone self-management support with nurse care management among patients with diabetes, Ann Fam Med, 2008 Nov-Dec; 6(6):1544-1717; 512-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Automated telephone self-management support with nurse care management for 9 months vs. Usual care for management of type 2 diabetes,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,9 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,65167,United States,2006,83660.4
5243,Cost effectiveness of community-based physical activity interventions,"BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity is associated with the increased risk of many chronic diseases. Such risks decrease with increases in physical activity. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of population-wide strategies to promote physical activity in adults and followed disease incidence over a lifetime. METHODS: A lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was conducted to estimate the costs, health gains, and cost-effectiveness (dollars per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained, relative to no intervention) of seven public health interventions to promote physical activity in a simulated cohort of healthy U.S. adults stratified by age, gender, and physical activity level. Interventions exemplifying each of four strategies strongly recommended by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services were evaluated: community-wide campaigns, individually adapted health behavior change, community social-support interventions, and the creation of or enhanced access to physical activity information and opportunities. Each intervention was compared to a no-intervention alternative. A systematic review of disease burden by physical activity status was used to assess the relative risk of five diseases (coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer) across a spectrum of physical activity levels. Other data were obtained from clinical trials, population-based surveys, and other published literature. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness ratios ranged between $14,000 and $69,000 per QALY gained, relative to no intervention. Results were sensitive to intervention-related costs and effect size.

5250,Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging of the knee for patients presenting in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal problems generate high costs. Of these disorders, patients with knee problems are commonly seen by GPs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee is an accurate diagnostic test, but there is uncertainty as to whether GP access to MRI for these patients is a cost-effective policy. AIM: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of GP referral to early MRI and a provisional orthopaedic appointment, compared with referral to an orthopaedic specialist without prior MRI for patients with continuing knee problems. Design of study: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pragmatic randomised trial. SETTING: Five-hundred and thirty-three patients consulting their GP about a knee problem were recruited from 163 general practices at 11 sites across the UK. METHOD: Two-year costs were estimated from the NHS perspective. Health outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), based on patient responses to the EQ-5D questionnaire administered at baseline, and at 6, 12, and 24 months' follow-up. RESULTS: Early MRI is associated with a higher NHS cost, by pound 294 ($581; euro 435) per patient (95% confidence interval [CI] = pound 31 to pound 573), and a larger number of QALYs, by 0.05 (95% CI = 0.025 to 0.118). Mean differences in cost and QALYs generated an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound 5840 ($11,538; euro 8642). At a cost per QALY threshold of pound 20,000, there is a 0.81 probability that early MRI is a cost-effective use of NHS resources.

5251,The cost-effectiveness of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: A quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV 6/11/16/18) vaccine has recently received regulatory approval in Taiwan for the prevention of cervical carcinoma, high-grade cervical dysplasia (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3 [CIN 2/3]), low-grade cervical dysplasia (CIN 1), high-grade vulvar and vaginal dysplasia, and external genital warts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential long-term epidemiologic and economic consequences of a quadrivalent HPV (6/11/16/18) vaccination program in Taiwan. METHODS: A transmission dynamic model was used to estimate the long-term epidemiologic and economic consequences of quadrivalent HPV vaccination. Two vaccination strategies were evaluated in conjunction with current cervical cancer screening: 1) vaccination of 12-year-old girls and 2) vaccination of 12-year-old girls with a temporary 5-year catch-up vaccination of females aged 12-24 years (catch-up). RESULTS: From an epidemiologic perspective, both vaccination strategies reduce the overall incidence of HPV 16/18-related cervical cancer relative to no vaccination by 91% during year 100 following vaccine introduction. Likewise, both vaccination strategies reduce the incidence of CIN 2/3, CIN 1, and genital warts by approximately 90%, 86%, and 94%, respectively, at this time point. However, the catch-up program consistently achieves greater benefit earlier than the 12-year-old program. The catch-up strategy is both more effective and efficient than the strategy that vaccinates 12-year-old girls only, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of New Taiwan dollars (NT$) 410,477 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this model suggest that in Taiwan, prophylactic HPV 6/11/16/18 vaccination of females can: 1) substantially reduce genital warts, CIN, and cervical cancer; 2) improve quality of life and survival; and 3) be cost-effective when implemented as a vaccination strategy that includes a temporary catch-up program.",2008-01-04384,18990021,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Erik J Dasbach,2008,9 / 3,459-66,No,18990021,"Erik J Dasbach; Ralph P Insinga; Yuh Cheng Yang; Raoh-Fang Pwu; Christina Lac; Elamin H Elbasha; The cost-effectiveness of a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine in Taiwan, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 2008 Jul-Sep; 9(3):1513-7368; 459-66",QALY,Taiwan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine vs. No vaccination,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,100 Years,3.00,3.00,437403.85,Taiwan,2006,17277.28

5253,Partial-Breast Irradiation Versus Whole-Breast Irradiation for Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"PURPOSE: Accelerated partial-breast irradiation (PBI) is a new treatment paradigm for patients with early-stage breast cancer. Although PBI may lead to greater local recurrence rates, it may be cost-effective because of better tolerability and lower cost. We aim to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of PBI compared with whole-breast radiation therapy (WBRT) for estrogen receptor-positive postmenopausal women treated for early-stage breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We developed a Markov model to describe health states in the 15 years after radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer. External beam (EB) and MammoSite (MS) PBI were considered and assumed to be equally effective, but carried different costs. Patients received tamoxifen, but not chemotherapy. Utilities, recurrence risks, and costs were adapted from the literature; the baseline utility for no disease after radiotherapy was set at 0.92. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to model uncertainty in the PBI hazard ratio, recurrence pattern, and patient utilities. Costs (in 2004 US dollars) and quality-adjusted life-years were discounted at 3%/y. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for WBRT compared with EB-PBI was $630,000/quality-adjusted life-year; WBRT strongly dominated MS-PBI. One-way sensitivity analysis found that results were sensitive to PBI hazard ratio, recurrence pattern, baseline recurrence risk, and no evidence of disease PBI utility values. Probabilistic sensitivity showed that EB-PBI was the most cost-effective technique over a wide range of assumptions and societal willingness-to-pay values. CONCLUSIONS: EB-PBI was the most cost-effective strategy for postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer.

Participants were 168 patients (27 females) requiring primary isolated CABG surgery. Patients were randomized to have the procedure performed by a single surgeon either with CPB (n = 84) or by an off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) surgery (n = 84). Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months using the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life (WHOQOL-100) questionnaire. Mean total costs of patient management by either technique were calculated using different available key sources. A utility measure, derived from WHOQOL-100, was used to calculate quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in each group, on basis of which a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed. The mean total costs of an OPCAB patient was 5859 pounds , whereas for a CPB patient it was 7431 pounds with a mean difference of 1572 pounds (standard error [SE] 674 pounds ; P = 0.02). Three patients died in the CPB group and two in the OPCAB group during the 6-month follow-up period. Mean QALYs over 6 months was 0.379 in the OPCAB group and 0.362 in the CPB group, but the difference was not significant (mean difference 0.017; SE 0.016; P = 0.305). OPCAB surgery offered patients in this randomized trial similar health benefits to CPB over a 6-month period, but at a significantly less cost.",2008-01-04403,18959683,Artif Organs,Sharif Al-Ruzzeh,2008,32 / 11,891-7,No,18959683,"Sharif Al-Ruzzeh; David Epstein; Shane George; Mahmoud Bustami; Jo Wray; Charles Ilsley; Mark Sculpher; Mohamed Amrani; Economic evaluation of coronary artery bypass grafting surgery with and without cardiopulmonary bypass: cost-effectiveness and quality-adjusted life years in a randomized controlled trial, Artif Organs, 2008-Nov; 32(11):1525-1594; 891-7",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) vs. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,92470.59,United Kingdom,2004,232229.12
5256,Cost-utility analysis of antihypertensive combination therapy in Japan by a Monte Carlo simulation model,"The objective of the present study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of lifetime antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) monotherapy, calcium channel blocker (CCB) monotherapy, or ARB plus CCB (ARB+CCB) combination therapy in Japan. Based on the results of large-scale clinical trials and epidemiological data, we constructed a Markov model for patients with essential hypertension. Our Markov model comprised coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and progression of diabetic nephropathy submodels. Based on this model, analysis of the prognosis of each patient was repeatedly conducted by Monte Carlo simulation. The three treatment strategies were compared in hypothetical 55-year-old patients with systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 160 mmHg in the absence and presence of comorbid diabetes.

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of universal childhood rotavirus vaccination in Belgium, taking into account the impact of caregiver burden and the burden of sick children for whom no medical care is sought (''no medical care''). METHODS: . A cohort of newborns is modeled in relation to costs and health outcomes for rotavirus disease, distinguishing episodes leading to consultations, hospitalizations, and deaths from no medical care episodes. Fully funded universal vaccination is compared with no vaccination as well as with the current situation in Belgium, whereby the 2-dose Rotarix or the 3-dose Rota-Teq vaccine can be bought at market prices, which are partially reimbursed. RESULTS: . Compared with no vaccination, fully funded universal rotavirus vaccination would costeuro 51,030 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with Rotarix and euro; 65,767 with RotaTeq (for society, euro 7572 and euro 30,227 per QALY, respectively). However, there is considerable uncertainty due to some analytical choices: the proportion of simulations with an acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (given a willingness to pay euro 50,000 for an additional QALY), increases from 2%/0.6% (Rotarix/RotaTeq) to 86%/59% when considering no medical care, and including 2 caregivers to estimate QALY loss instead of zero.

The main model parameters were populated with data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study and a recent trial comparing aripiprazole with olanzapine. Patients enter the model with stable schizophrenia and may relapse, discontinue or continue and experience adverse events (AEs), or develop diabetes. Population mortality was adjusted for schizophrenia and diabetes.

The main model parameters were populated with data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) study and a recent trial comparing aripiprazole with olanzapine.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov Model was developed to estimate quality-adjusted life expectancy and lifetime costs among 61-year-old women with clinically node-negative early breast cancer. Three axillary staging strategies were compared: MR lymphangiography alone, combined MR lymphangiography-SLN biopsy, and SLN biopsy alone. The model incorporated treatment decisions, outcome, and costs consequent to axillary staging results. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to compare strategies. The effect of changes in key parameters on results was addressed in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, combined MR lymphangiography-SLN biopsy was associated with the highest quality-adjusted life expectancy (13.970 years) and cost ($63,582), followed by SLN biopsy alone (13.958 years, $62,462) and MR lymphangiography alone (13.957 years, $61,605). MR lymphangiography-SLN biopsy and SLN biopsy both were associated with higher life expectancy and cost relative to those of MR lymphangiography. MR lymphangiography-SLN biopsy, however, was associated with greater overall life expectancy and greater added life expectancy per dollar than was SLN biopsy. SLN biopsy alone therefore was not considered cost-effective, but MR lymphangiography and MR lymphangiography-SLN biopsy remained competing choices. Preference of MR lymphangiography strategies was most dependent on the sensitivity of MR lymphangiography and SLN biopsy and on the quality-of-life consequences of SLN biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection, but otherwise was stable across most parameter ranges tested. CONCLUSION: From a cost-effectiveness perspective, MR lymphangiography strategies for axillary staging of early breast cancer are preferred over SLN biopsy alone.

5278,Cost-effectiveness of nurse-led disease management for heart failure in an ethnically diverse urban community,"BACKGROUND: Randomized, controlled trials have shown that nurse-led disease management for patients with heart failure can reduce hospitalizations. Less is known about the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led disease management intervention over 12 months, implemented in a randomized, controlled effectiveness trial. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a randomized trial. DATA SOURCES: Medical costs from administrative records, and self-reported quality of life and nonmedical costs from patient surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with systolic dysfunction recruited from ambulatory clinics in Harlem, New York. TIME HORIZON: 12 months. Perspective: Societal and payer. INTERVENTION: 12-month program that involved 1 face-to-face encounter with a nurse and regular telephone follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life as measured by the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 and EuroQol-5D and cost-effectiveness as measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Costs and quality of life were higher in the nurse-managed group than the usual care group. The ICERs over 12 months were $17,543 per EuroQol-5D-based quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and $15,169 per Health Utilities Index Mark 3-based QALY (in 2001 U.S. dollars). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: From a payer perspective, the ICER ranged from $3673 to $4495 per QALY. Applying national prices in place of New York City prices yielded a societal ICER of $13,460 to $15,556 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves suggest that the intervention was most likely cost-effective for patients with less severe (New York Heart Association classes I to II) heart failure.

Less is known about the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led disease management intervention over 12 months, implemented in a randomized, controlled effectiveness trial. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a randomized trial. DATA SOURCES: Medical costs from administrative records, and self-reported quality of life and nonmedical costs from patient surveys. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with systolic dysfunction recruited from ambulatory clinics in Harlem, New York. TIME HORIZON: 12 months. Perspective: Societal and payer. INTERVENTION: 12-month program that involved 1 face-to-face encounter with a nurse and regular telephone follow-up. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life as measured by the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 and EuroQol-5D and cost-effectiveness as measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Costs and quality of life were higher in the nurse-managed group than the usual care group. The ICERs over 12 months were $17,543 per EuroQol-5D-based quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and $15,169 per Health Utilities Index Mark 3-based QALY (in 2001 U.S. dollars). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: From a payer perspective, the ICER ranged from $3673 to $4495 per QALY. Applying national prices in place of New York City prices yielded a societal ICER of $13,460 to $15,556 per QALY.

5282,Computerized model of cost-utility analysis for treatment of age-related macular degeneration,"PURPOSE: To present a computerized model assessing individualized cost utility for current treatments for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to enhance discussion regarding treatment options. DESIGN: Case- and eye-specific cost-utility analysis using individual case scenarios. PARTICIPANTS: Visual acuity data from published randomized controlled trials are incorporated into this analysis. METHODS: Computerized model (Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 programming) to establish preference-based cost-utility analysis in association with individual cost of treatment and blindness for neovascular AMD for both the better and worst seeing eye, with extrapolation of results over a 5-year term. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and cost per QALY gained for comparison of treatments for specific visual acuities. RESULTS: All treatments show an increase in utility in comparison with best supportive care (BSC) if the better-seeing eye is treated. Ranibizumab, using the Phase IIIb, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Masked, Sham Injection-Controlled Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Ranibizumab in Subjects with Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularisation (CNV) with or without Classic CNV Secondary to AMD (PIER) regimen, is the most cost effective at $626 938 per QALY gained for treatment of the better seeing eye. To increase utility value when treating the worst seeing eye, the vision must improve to such a degree that it becomes the better seeing eye. This level of improvement is only possible if there is <9 letters difference between the 2 eyes and treated with ranibizumab. Over 5 years, increasing influence from the cost of blindness results in increasing costs for those treatments unable to stabilize vision. Within 5 years, the cost per QALY for the BSC is greater than all treatments except monthly ranibizumab injections. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of cost of treatment incorporates both effectiveness of treatment, cost of treatment, and cost of blindness. Cost analysis enables incorporation of these aspects of treatment with the quality of life data to provide a better comparison of treatments over time.

5286,The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab for respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in premature infants with a gestational age of 32-35 weeks: a Canadian-based analysis,"BACKGROUND: Prophylactic therapy with palivizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, has been shown to reduce the number of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-related hospitalizations in preterm infants, including those in the 32-35 weeks' gestational age (GA) subgroup. The cost-effectiveness of this therapy in Canada is unknown.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab as respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in premature infants born at 32-35 weeks' GA.DESIGN: A decision analytic model was designed to compare both direct and indirect medical costs and benefits of prophylaxis in this subgroup of premature infants. Sensitivity analyses were performed to ascertain the robustness of the model for five point estimates: mortality rate, discounting rates, health-utility values, degree of vial-sharing and administration costs. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was also conducted.SETTING: Canadian publicly funded health-care system (Ministry of Health payer perspective) for base-case analysis. Societal perspective, accounting for future lost productivity, was adopted for a secondary analysis.PARTICIPANTS: Canadian infants born at 32-35 weeks' GA without chronic lung disease.INTERVENTIONS: Palivizumab prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per life-year gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) using 2007 Canadian dollars.RESULTS: The expected costs were higher for palivizumab prophylaxis as compared with no prophylaxis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the base-case scenario was $20 924 per QALY after discounting, which is considered cost-effective in Canada. When the uncertainty of the input parameter assumptions was tested through sensitivity analyses assessing several data sources for five key parameters, no substantial differences were found from the base-case results. The PSA indicated a 0.99 probability that the ICER for palivizumab was less than $50 000/QALY.

5288,Costs and cost-effectiveness of family CBT versus individual CBT in clinically anxious children,"The objective of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of family cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with individual CBT in children with anxiety disorders. Clinically anxious children (aged 8-18 years) referred for treatment were randomly assigned to family or individual CBT and were assessed pre-treatment, post treatment, and at 3 months and 1 year after treatment. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated expressing the incremental costs per anxiety-free child and the incremental costs per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) for the referred child. Neither societal costs nor effectiveness were significantly different between individual and family CBT. However, the point estimates of the cost-effectiveness ratios resulted in dominance for individual CBT, indicating that individual CBT is more effective and less costly than family CBT. These results were confirmed by bootstrap analyses and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. Several secondary and sensitivity analyses showed that the results were robust. It can be concluded that family CBT is not a cost-effective treatment for clinically anxious children, compared with individual CBT.",2008-01-04423,18927140,Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry,Denise H M Bodden,2008,13 / 4,543-64,No,18927140,"Denise H M Bodden; Carmen D Dirksen; Susan M Bögels; Maaike H Nauta; Else De Haan; Jaap Ringrose; Carla Appelboom; Andries G Brinkman; Karen C M M J Appelboom-Geerts; Costs and cost-effectiveness of family CBT versus individual CBT in clinically anxious children, Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry, 2008-Oct; 13(4):1359-1045; 543-64",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Family cognitive-behavioral therapy vs. Individual cognitive-behavioral therapy,Not Stated,18 Years,8 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Months,4.00,Not Stated,-14950,Euro,2003,-23805.35
5289,Cost effectiveness of alternative surveillance strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the United States has significant health and economic consequences. Ultrasound (US) surveillance is recommended for patients with cirrhosis because of their high risk of HCC and improving treatment outcomes for small tumors. We assessed the costs, clinical benefits, and cost effectiveness of US surveillance and alternative strategies for HCC in cirrhosis using a computer-based state transition model with parameters derived from available literature. METHODS: Our model compared a policy of no surveillance with 6 surveillance strategies in cirrhotic patients ages 50 years and older in the United States: (1) annual US, (2) semiannual US, (3) semiannual US with alpha-fetoprotein, (4) annual computed tomography (CT), (5) semiannual CT, and (6) annual magnetic resonance imaging. The number of screening tests needed to detect one small HCC, cost per treated HCC, lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Semiannual US surveillance for HCC in cirrhosis increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 8.6 months on average, but extended it nearly 3.5 years in patients with small treated tumors.

Ultrasound (US) surveillance is recommended for patients with cirrhosis because of their high risk of HCC and improving treatment outcomes for small tumors. We assessed the costs, clinical benefits, and cost effectiveness of US surveillance and alternative strategies for HCC in cirrhosis using a computer-based state transition model with parameters derived from available literature. METHODS: Our model compared a policy of no surveillance with 6 surveillance strategies in cirrhotic patients ages 50 years and older in the United States: (1) annual US, (2) semiannual US, (3) semiannual US with alpha-fetoprotein, (4) annual computed tomography (CT), (5) semiannual CT, and (6) annual magnetic resonance imaging. The number of screening tests needed to detect one small HCC, cost per treated HCC, lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Semiannual US surveillance for HCC in cirrhosis increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 8.6 months on average, but extended it nearly 3.5 years in patients with small treated tumors.

5295,Economic evaluation of a neural tube defect recurrence-prevention program,"BACKGROUND: Women with a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect (NTD) are encouraged to take folic acid prior to a subsequent pregnancy, but it is unknown whether organized attempts to identify and counsel such women to prevent recurrent NTDs are cost effective. METHODS: Data from the South Carolina recurrence-prevention program for October 2001-September 2002 were analyzed between October 2002 and December 2003 to calculate costs. Cost-effectiveness modeling of the program during 1992-2006 was conducted during 2007. Results were calculated for three scenarios based on recurrence risk, supplement use, and the effectiveness of folic acid in preventing recurrences. For each scenario, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated separately using prevented NTD-affected live births; prevented NTD-affected births (including fetal deaths); and all prevented NTD-affected pregnancies. RESULTS: The prevention program cost approximately $155,000 per year in 2003 dollars to protect 35 pregnancies and prevent approximately one NTD. The direct costs associated with an NTD depend on type and outcome, but are approximately $560,000 in 2003 dollars for a live birth with spina bifida. The base-case cost-effectiveness ratio was $39,600 per QALY gained from avoided NTD-affected live births and stillbirths, and $14,700 per QALY gained from the avoidance of all NTD-affected pregnancies. The baseline NTD recurrence risk and the use of folic acid supplements by women who are at high risk for an NTD-affected pregnancy were influential parameters.

At the same time preoperative lifestyle intervention (prehabilitation) has revealed a large potential for additional risk reduction. The aim was to assess the quality of life and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of standard care versus an integrated programme including prehabilitation and early rehabilitation. METHODS: The analyses were based on the results from 60 patients undergoing lumbar fusion for degenerative lumbar disease; 28 patients were randomised to the integrated programme and 32 to the standard care programme. Data on cost and health related quality of life was collected preoperatively, during hospitalisation and postoperatively. The cost was estimated from multiplication of the resource consumption and price per unit. RESULTS: Overall there was no difference in health related quality of life scores. The patients from the integrated programme obtained their postoperative milestones sooner, returned to work and soaked less primary care after discharge. The integrated programme was 1,625 euros (direct costs 494 euros + indirect costs 1,131 euros) less costly per patient compared to the standard care programme.
