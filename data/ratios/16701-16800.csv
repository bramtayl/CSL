16707,Cost-Effectiveness of Treatment Sequences of Chemotherapies and Targeted Biologics for Elderly Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients,"BACKGROUND: Treatment patterns for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients have changed considerably over the last decade with the introduction of new chemotherapies and targeted biologics. These treatments are often administered in various sequences with limited evidence regarding their cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of commonly administered treatment sequences among elderly mCRC patients. METHODS: A probabilistic discrete event simulation model assuming Weibull distribution was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the following common treatment sequences: (a) first-line oxaliplatin/irinotecan followed by second-line oxaliplatin/irinotecan + bevacizumab (OI-OIB); (b) first-line oxaliplatin/irinotecan + bevacizumab followed by second-line oxaliplatin/irinotecan + bevacizumab (OIB-OIB); (c) OI-OIB followed by a third-line targeted biologic (OI-OIB-TB); and (d) OIB-OIB followed by a third-line targeted biologic (OIB-OIB-TB). Input parameters for the model were primarily obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare linked dataset for incident mCRC patients aged 65 years and older diagnosed from January 2004 through December 2009. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to account for parameter uncertainty. Costs (2014 U.S. dollars) and effectiveness were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. RESULTS: In the base case analyses, at the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, the treatment sequence OIB-OIB (vs. OI-OIB) was not cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per patient of $119,007/QALY; OI-OIB-TB (vs. OIB-OIB) was dominated; and OIB-OIB-TB (vs. OIB-OIB) was not cost-effective with an ICER of $405,857/QALY. Results similar to the base case analysis were obtained assuming log-normal distribution. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves derived from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a WTP of $100,000/QALY gained, sequence OI-OIB was 34% cost-effective, followed by OIB-OIB (31%), OI-OIB-TB (20%), and OIB-OIB-TB (15%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, survival increases marginally with the addition of targeted biologics, such as bevacizumab, at first line and third line at substantial costs. Treatment sequences with bevacizumab at first line and targeted biologics at third line may not be cost-effective at the commonly used threshold of $100,000/QALY gained, but a marginal decrease in the cost of bevacizumab may make treatment sequences with first-line bevacizumab cost-effective. Future economic evaluations should validate the study results using parameters from ongoing clinical trials.

16710,Cost-effectiveness of the Norwegian breast cancer screening program,"The Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Programme (NBCSP) has a nation-wide coverage since 2005. All women aged 50-69 years are invited biennially for mammography screening. We evaluated breast cancer mortality reduction and performed a cost-effectiveness analysis, using our microsimulation model, calibrated to most recent data. The microsimulation model allows for the comparison of mortality and costs between a (hypothetical) situation without screening and a situation with screening. Breast cancer incidence in Norway had a steep increase in the early 1990s. We calibrated the model to simulate this increase and included recent costs for screening, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer and travel and productivity loss. We estimate a 16% breast cancer mortality reduction for a cohort of women, invited to screening, followed over their complete lifetime. Cost-effectiveness is estimated at NOK 112,162 per QALY gained, when taking only direct medical costs into account (the cost of the buses, examinations, and invitations). We used a 3.5% annual discount rate. Cost-effectiveness estimates are substantially below the threshold of NOK 1,926,366 as recommended by the WHO guidelines. For the Norwegian population, which has been gradually exposed to screening, breast cancer mortality reduction for women exposed to screening is increasing and is estimated to rise to approximately 30% in 2020 for women aged 55-80 years. The NBCSP is a highly cost-effective measure to reduce breast cancer specific mortality. We estimate a breast cancer specific mortality reduction of 16-30%, at the cost of 112,162 NOK per QALY gained.",2017-01-21653,27861849,Int J Cancer,P A van Luijt,2017,140 / 4,833-840,No,27861849,"P A van Luijt; E A M Heijnsdijk; H J De Koning; Cost-effectiveness of the Norwegian breast cancer screening program, Int J Cancer, 2017 Feb 15; 140(4):0020-7136; 833-840",QALY,Norway,Not Stated,Not Stated,Breast cancer screening vs. None,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,189557,Norway,2014,32981.08
16711,Cost-effectiveness of active surveillance versus hemithyroidectomy for micropapillary thyroid cancer,"BACKGROUND: The management of low-risk micropapillary thyroid cancer <1 cm in size has come into question, because recent data have shown that nonoperative active surveillance of micropapillary thyroid cancer is a viable alternative to hemithyroidectomy. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to help decide between observation versus operation. METHODS: We constructed Markov models for active surveillance and hemithyroidectomy. The reference case was a 40-year-old patient with recently diagnosed, low-risk micropapillary thyroid cancer. Costs and health utilities were determined using extensive literature review. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000/quality-adjusted life year gained. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty in the model''s variables. RESULTS: Active surveillance is dominant (less expensive and more quality-adjusted life years) for a health utility <0.01 below that for disease-free, posthemithyroidectomy state, or for a remaining life expectancy of <2 years. For a utility difference >/=0.02, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (the ratio of the difference in costs between active surveillance and hemithyroidectomy divided by the difference in quality-adjusted life years) for hemithyroidectomy is <$100,000/QALY gained and thus cost-effective. For a utility difference of 0.11-the reference case scenario-the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for hemithyroidectomy is $4,437/quality-adjusted life year gained. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of hemithyroidectomy is highly dependent on patient disutility associated with active surveillance. In patients who would associate nonoperative management with at least a modest decrement in quality of life, hemithyroidectomy is cost-effective.",2017-01-21685,27839930,Surgery,Shriya Venkatesh,2017,161 / 1,116-126,No,27839930,"Shriya Venkatesh; Jesse D Pasternak; Toni Beninato; Frederick T Drake; Wouter P Kluijfhout; Chienying Liu; Jessica E Gosnell; Wen T Shen; Orlo H Clark; Quan-Yang Duh; Insoo Suh; Cost-effectiveness of active surveillance versus hemithyroidectomy for micropapillary thyroid cancer, Surgery, 2017 Jan; 161(1):0039-6060; 116-126",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,hemithyroidectomy vs. nonoperative active surveillance,"biopsy-proven, unifocal mPTC without features that would necessitate immediate operation (such as unfavorable location near the trachea or recurrent laryngeal nerve, high-grade features on biopsy, or nodal disease)",Not Stated,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,4437,United States,2015,4844.99
16712,Parathyroidectomy for asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: A revised cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating fracture risk reduction,"BACKGROUND: Recent data demonstrate decreased fracture risk after operation for asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. We performed a revised cost-effectiveness analysis comparing parathyroidectomy versus observation while incorporating fracture risk reduction. METHODS: A Markov transition-state model was created comparing parathyroidectomy and guideline-based medical observation for a 60-year-old female patient with mild asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism. Costs were estimated using published Medicare reimbursement data. Treatment strategy outcomes, including risk of fracture, were identified by literature review. Quality adjustment factors were used to weight treatment outcomes. A threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year was used to determine cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation were performed to examine the effect of uncertainty on the model. RESULTS: Parathyroidectomy was the dominant strategy (less costly and more effective) with an incremental cost savings of $1,721 and an incremental effectiveness of 0.185 quality-adjusted life years. Parathyroidectomy remained dominant when the relative risk reduction of fracture after operation was >/=14%, the cost of fracture was >/=$7,600, or the probability of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury was <12.5%. Monte Carlo simulation showed parathyroidectomy was cost-effective in 995/1,000 hypothetical patients.

16713,Surgery for degenerative cervical myelopathy: a patient-centered quality of life and health economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) represents the most common cause of non-traumatic spinal cord impairment in adults. Surgery has been shown to improve neurologic symptoms and functional status, but it is costly. As sustainability concerns in the field of health care rise, the value of care has come to the forefront of policy decision-making. Evidence for both health-related quality of life outcomes and financial expenditures is needed to inform resource allocation decisions. PURPOSE: This study aimed to estimate the lifetime incremental cost-utility of surgical treatment for DCM. DESIGN/SETTING: This is a prospective observational cohort study at a Canadian tertiary care facility. PATIENT SAMPLE: We recruited all patients undergoing surgery for DCM at a single center between 2005 and 2011 who were enrolled in either the AOSpine Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy (CSM)-North America study or the AOSpine CSM-International study. OUTCOME MEASURES: Health utility was measured at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery using the Short Form-6D (SF-6D) health utility score. Resource expenditures were calculated on an individual level, from the hospital payer perspective over the 24-month follow-up period. All costs were obtained from a micro-cost database maintained by the institutional finance department and reported in Canadian dollars, inflated to January 2015 values. METHODS: Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains for the study period were determined using an area under the curve calculation with a linear interpolation estimate. Lifetime incremental cost-to-utility ratios (ICUR) for surgery were estimated using a Markov state transition model. Structural uncertainty arising from lifetime extrapolation and the single-arm cohort design of the study were accounted for by constructing two models. The first included a highly conservative assumption that individuals undergoing nonoperative management would not experience any lifetime neurologic decline. This constraint was relaxed in the second model to permit more general parameters based on the established natural history. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were employed to account for parameter uncertainty. All QALY gains and costs were discounted at a base of 3% per annum. Statistical significance was set at the .05 level. RESULTS: The analysis included 171 patients; follow-up was 96.5%. Mean age was 58.2+/-12.0 years and baseline health utility was 0.56+/-0.14. Mean QALY gained over the 24-month study period was 0.139 (95% confidence interval: 0.109-0.170, p<.001) and the mean 2-year cost of treatment was $19,217.82+/-12,404.23. Cost associated with the operation comprised 65.7% of the total. The remainder was apportioned over presurgical preparation and postsurgical recovery. Three patients required a reoperation over the 2-year follow-up period. The costs of revision surgery represented 1.85% of the total costs. Using the conservative model structure, the estimated lifetime ICUR of surgical intervention was $20,547.84/QALY gained, with 94.7% of estimates falling within the World Health Organization definition of ""very cost-effective"" ($54,000 CAD). Using the more general model structure, the estimated lifetime ICUR of surgical intervention was $11,496.02/QALY gained, with 97.9% of estimates meeting the criteria to be considered ""very cost-effective.""

16715,Optimal Cervical Cancer Screening in Women Vaccinated Against Human Papillomavirus,"BACKGROUND: Current US cervical cancer screening guidelines do not differentiate recommendations based on a woman''s human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination status. Changes to cervical cancer screening policies in HPV-vaccinated women should be evaluated. METHODS: We utilized an individual-based mathematical model of HPV and cervical cancer in US women to project the health benefits, costs, and harms associated with screening strategies in women vaccinated with the bivalent, quadrivalent, or nonavalent vaccine. Strategies varied by the primary screening test, including cytology, HPV, and combined cytology and HPV ""cotesting""; age of screening initiation and/or switching to a new test; and interval between routine screens. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective to identify screening strategies that would be considered good value for money according to thresholds of $50 000 to $200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.

METHODS: We utilized an individual-based mathematical model of HPV and cervical cancer in US women to project the health benefits, costs, and harms associated with screening strategies in women vaccinated with the bivalent, quadrivalent, or nonavalent vaccine. Strategies varied by the primary screening test, including cytology, HPV, and combined cytology and HPV ""cotesting""; age of screening initiation and/or switching to a new test; and interval between routine screens. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective to identify screening strategies that would be considered good value for money according to thresholds of $50 000 to $200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Among women fully vaccinated with the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, optimal screening strategies involved either cytology or HPV testing alone every five years starting at age 25 or 30 years, with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $34 680 to $138 560 per QALY gained. Screening earlier or more frequently was either not cost-effective or associated with exceedingly high cost-effectiveness ratios. In women vaccinated with the nonavalent vaccine, only primary HPV testing was efficient, involving decreased frequency (ie, every 10 years) starting at either age 35 years ($40 210 per QALY) or age 30 years ($127 010 per QALY); with lower nonavalent vaccine efficacy, 10-year HPV testing starting at earlier ages of 25 or 30 years was optimal. Importantly, current US guidelines for screening were inefficient in HPV-vaccinated women.

Strategies varied by the primary screening test, including cytology, HPV, and combined cytology and HPV ""cotesting""; age of screening initiation and/or switching to a new test; and interval between routine screens.

Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective to identify screening strategies that would be considered good value for money according to thresholds of $50 000 to $200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Among women fully vaccinated with the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, optimal screening strategies involved either cytology or HPV testing alone every five years starting at age 25 or 30 years, with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $34 680 to $138 560 per QALY gained. Screening earlier or more frequently was either not cost-effective or associated with exceedingly high cost-effectiveness ratios. In women vaccinated with the nonavalent vaccine, only primary HPV testing was efficient, involving decreased frequency (ie, every 10 years) starting at either age 35 years ($40 210 per QALY) or age 30 years ($127 010 per QALY); with lower nonavalent vaccine efficacy, 10-year HPV testing starting at earlier ages of 25 or 30 years was optimal. Importantly, current US guidelines for screening were inefficient in HPV-vaccinated women.

Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective to identify screening strategies that would be considered good value for money according to thresholds of $50 000 to $200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Among women fully vaccinated with the bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine, optimal screening strategies involved either cytology or HPV testing alone every five years starting at age 25 or 30 years, with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $34 680 to $138 560 per QALY gained. Screening earlier or more frequently was either not cost-effective or associated with exceedingly high cost-effectiveness ratios. In women vaccinated with the nonavalent vaccine, only primary HPV testing was efficient, involving decreased frequency (ie, every 10 years) starting at either age 35 years ($40 210 per QALY) or age 30 years ($127 010 per QALY); with lower nonavalent vaccine efficacy, 10-year HPV testing starting at earlier ages of 25 or 30 years was optimal. Importantly, current US guidelines for screening were inefficient in HPV-vaccinated women.

However, few data are available on the socioeconomic impact of RM. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the costs and benefits of RM compared with standard care (SC). METHODS: We used 12-month patient data from the Health Economics Evaluation Registry for Remote Follow-up (TARIFF) study (N = 209; RM: n = 102 (48.81%); SC: n = 107 (51.19%)).

16784,Cost-utility analysis of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C in Japan,"OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis C is the result of a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus (hepatitis C virus; HCV). The Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH) estimated that 1.5-2 million people in Japan carry HCV. Six major HCV genotypes (GT) and a large number of subtypes have been described in the literature. In Japan, around 70% to 80% of people are infected with HCV genotype 1b. The progress of the disease primarily affects the liver and may lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nucleotide analogue NS5B inhibitor and ledipasvir (LDV) is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein.

This analysis assesses the cost-utility of LDV/SOF in GT1 patients in Japan. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 10,000 patients was followed through a Markov model until they reached 100 years of age. GT1 treatment-naive and experienced, non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients were studied separately. LDV/SOF was compared to several treatment regimens containing pegylated interferon (PEGIFN), telaprevir (TVR), simeprevir (SMV), daclatasvir (DCV), asunaprevir (ASV) and ribavirin (RBV). Discount rates of 2% were applied to costs and outcomes according to the Japanese guidelines. RESULTS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective against most comparators with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below JPY 5,000,000. By applying a societal perspective, LDV/SOF was the dominant treatment strategy in all cases. Moreover, LDV/SOF reduced the number of cases of advanced liver disease. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective compared to most of the currently recommended treatments.

LDV/SOF was compared to several treatment regimens containing pegylated interferon (PEGIFN), telaprevir (TVR), simeprevir (SMV), daclatasvir (DCV), asunaprevir (ASV) and ribavirin (RBV). Discount rates of 2% were applied to costs and outcomes according to the Japanese guidelines. RESULTS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective against most comparators with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below JPY 5,000,000. By applying a societal perspective, LDV/SOF was the dominant treatment strategy in all cases. Moreover, LDV/SOF reduced the number of cases of advanced liver disease. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective compared to most of the currently recommended treatments. Furthermore, LDV/SOF extends treatments to HCV-infected patients who are ineligible for interferon and RBV-based regimens.
