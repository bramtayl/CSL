30908,Cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination in ten endemic countries,"Following publication of results from two phase-3 clinical trials in 10 countries or territories, endemic countries began licensing the first dengue vaccine in 2015. Using a published mathematical model, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination in populations similar to those at the trial sites in those same Latin American and Asian countries. Our main scenarios (30-year horizon, 80% coverage) entailed 3-dose routine vaccinations costing US$20/dose beginning at age 9, potentially supplemented by catch-up programs of 4- or 8-year cohorts. We obtained illness costs per case, dengue mortality, vaccine wastage, and vaccine administration costs from the literature. We estimated that routine vaccination would reduce yearly direct and indirect illness cost per capita by 22% (from US$10.51 to US$8.17) in the Latin American countries and by 23% (from US$5.78 to US$4.44) in the Asian countries. Using a health system perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) averaged US$4,216/disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in the five Latin American countries (range: US$666/DALY in Puerto Rico to US$5,865/DALY in Mexico). In the five Asian countries, the ICER averaged US$3,751/DALY (range: US$1,935/DALY in Malaysia to US$5,101/DALY in the Philippines). From a health system perspective, the vaccine proved to be highly cost effective (ICER under one times the per capita GDP) in seven countries and cost effective (ICER 1-3 times the per capita GDP) in the remaining three countries. From a societal perspective, routine vaccination proved cost-saving in three countries. Including catch-up campaigns gave similar ICERs. Thus, this vaccine could have a favorable economic value in sites similar to those in the trials.",2018-XX-26138,29229427,Vaccine,Wu Zeng,2018,36 / 3,413-420,Yes,29229427,"Wu Zeng; Yara A Halasa-Rappel; Nicolas Baurin; Laurent Coudeville; Donald S Shepard; Cost-effectiveness of dengue vaccination in ten endemic countries, Vaccine, 2018 Jan 8; 36(3):1873-2518; 413-420",DALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Immunization,Routine dengue vaccination only at age 9 vs. None,Not Stated,9 Years,9 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,4840,United States,2015,5285.04

Our main scenarios (30-year horizon, 80% coverage) entailed 3-dose routine vaccinations costing US$20/dose beginning at age 9, potentially supplemented by catch-up programs of 4- or 8-year cohorts. We obtained illness costs per case, dengue mortality, vaccine wastage, and vaccine administration costs from the literature. We estimated that routine vaccination would reduce yearly direct and indirect illness cost per capita by 22% (from US$10.51 to US$8.17) in the Latin American countries and by 23% (from US$5.78 to US$4.44) in the Asian countries. Using a health system perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) averaged US$4,216/disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted in the five Latin American countries (range: US$666/DALY in Puerto Rico to US$5,865/DALY in Mexico). In the five Asian countries, the ICER averaged US$3,751/DALY (range: US$1,935/DALY in Malaysia to US$5,101/DALY in the Philippines).

30968,Cost-effectiveness of WHO-Recommended Algorithms for TB Case Finding at Ethiopian HIV Clinics,"Background: The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends active tuberculosis (TB) case finding and a rapid molecular diagnostic test (Xpert MTB/RIF) to detect TB among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in high-burden settings. Information on the cost-effectiveness of these recommended strategies is crucial for their implementation. Methods: We conducted a model-based cost-effectiveness analysis comparing 2 algorithms for TB screening and diagnosis at Ethiopian HIV clinics: (1) WHO-recommended symptom screen combined with Xpert for PLHIV with a positive symptom screen and (2) current recommended practice algorithm (CRPA; based on symptom screening, smear microscopy, and clinical TB diagnosis). Our primary outcome was US$ per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Secondary outcomes were additional true-positive diagnoses, and false-negative and false-positive diagnoses averted. Results: Compared with CRPA, combining a WHO-recommended symptom screen with Xpert was highly cost-effective (incremental cost of $5 per DALY averted). Among a cohort of 15 000 PLHIV with a TB prevalence of 6% (900 TB cases), this algorithm detected 8 more true-positive cases than CRPA, and averted 2045 false-positive and 8 false-negative diagnoses compared with CRPA. The WHO-recommended algorithm was marginally costlier ($240 000) than CRPA ($239 000). In sensitivity analysis, the symptom screen/Xpert algorithm was dominated at low Xpert sensitivity (66%). Conclusions: In this model-based analysis, combining a WHO-recommended symptom screen with Xpert for TB diagnosis among PLHIV was highly cost-effective ($5 per DALY averted) and more sensitive than CRPA in a high-burden, resource-limited setting.",2018-XX-26116,29399596,Open Forum Infect Dis,Max W Adelman,2018,5 / 1,ofx269,No,29399596,"Max W Adelman; Deborah A McFarland; Mulugeta Tsegaye; Abraham Aseffa; Russell R Kempker; Henry M Blumberg; Cost-effectiveness of WHO-Recommended Algorithms for TB Case Finding at Ethiopian HIV Clinics, Open Forum Infect Dis, 2018 Jan; 5(1):2328-8957; ofx269",DALY,Ethiopia,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Screening",TB symptom screen + Xpert testing on positive screen samples vs. Standard/Usual Care,People living with HIV,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,5.2,United States,2014,5.68

30973,Estimating the cost and cost-effectiveness for obstetric fistula repair in hospitals in Uganda: a low income country,"In Africa, about 33 000 cases of obstetric fistula occur each year. Women with fistula experience debilitating incontinence of urine and/or faeces and are often socially ostracized. Worldwide, Uganda ranks third among countries with the highest burden of obstetric fistula. Obstetric fistula repair competes for scarce resources with other healthcare interventions in resource-limited settings, even though it is surgically efficacious. There is limited documentation of its cost-effectiveness in the most affected settings. We therefore sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of surgical intervention for obstetric fistula in Uganda so as to provide appropriate data for policy-makers to prioritize fistula repair and reduce women''s suffering in similarly burdened countries. We built a decision-analytic model from the perspective of Uganda''s National Health System to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vesico-vaginal and recto-vaginal fistula surgery vs a competing strategy of no surgery for Ugandan women with fistula. Long-term disability outcomes were assessed based on a lifetime Markov state-transition cohort and effectiveness of surgery. Surgical costs were estimated by micro-costing local Ugandan health resources. Disability weights associated with vesico-vaginal, recto-vaginal fistula and mortality rates among the general population in Uganda were based on published sources. The cost of providing fistula repair surgery in Uganda was estimated at $378 per procedure. For a hypothetical 20-year-old woman, surgery was estimated to decrease the lifetime disability burden from 8.53 DALYs to 1.51 DALYs, yielding a cost per DALY averted of $54. The results were robust to variations in model inputs in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Surgery for obstetric fistula appears highly cost-effective in Uganda. In similar low-income countries, governments and non-governmental organizations need to prioritize training and strengthening surgical capacity to increase access to fistula surgical care, which would be an important step towards achieving universal health coverage.",2018-99-28905,30252051,Health Policy Plan,Isabella Epiu,2018,33 / 9,999-1008,No,30252051,"Isabella Epiu; Godfrey Alia; John Mukisa; Paula Tavrow; Mohammed Lamorde; Andreas Kuznik; Estimating the cost and cost-effectiveness for obstetric fistula repair in hospitals in Uganda: a low income country, Health Policy Plan, 2018 Nov 1; 33(9):0268-1080; 999-1008",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,Surgical,Fistula repair surgery vs. None,Not Stated,40 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,54,United States,2016,58.23
30974,Evidence From Ghana Indicates That Childhood Cancer Treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa Is Very Cost Effective: A Report From the Childhood Cancer 2030 Network,"PURPOSE: No published study to date has examined total cost and cost-effectiveness of maintaining a pediatric oncology treatment center in an African setting, thus limiting childhood cancer advocacy and policy efforts. METHODS: Within the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra, Ghana, costing data were gathered for all inputs related to operating a pediatric cancer unit. Cost and volume data for relevant clinical services (eg, laboratory, pathology, medications) were obtained retrospectively or prospectively. Salaries were determined and multiplied by proportion of time dedicated toward pediatric patients with cancer. Costs associated with inpatient bed use, outpatient clinic use, administrative fees, and overhead were estimated. Costs were summed for a total annual operating cost. Cost-effectiveness was calculated based on annual patients with newly diagnosed disease, survival rates, and life expectancy. RESULTS: The Korle Bu Teaching Hospital pediatric cancer unit treats on average 170 new diagnoses annually. Total operating cost was $1.7 million/y. Personnel salaries and operating room costs were the most expensive inputs, contributing 45% and 21% of total costs. Together, medications, imaging, radiation, and pathology services accounted for 7%. The cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted was $1,034, less than the Ghanaian per capita income, and thus considered very cost effective as per WHO-CHOICE methodology. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine institution-level costs and cost-effectiveness of a childhood cancer program in an African setting, demonstrating that operating such a program in this setting is very cost effective. These results will inform national childhood cancer strategies in Africa and other low- and middle-income country settings.",2018-99-28934,30241273,J Glob Oncol,Lorna Renner,2018,4 /,1-9,No,30241273,"Lorna Renner; Shivani Shah; Nickhill Bhakta; Avram Denburg; Sue Horton; Sumit Gupta; Evidence From Ghana Indicates That Childhood Cancer Treatment in Sub-Saharan Africa Is Very Cost Effective: A Report From the Childhood Cancer 2030 Network, J Glob Oncol, 2018 Sep; 4():2378-9506; 1-9",DALY,Ghana,Not Stated,Care Delivery,Pediatric oncology treatment center vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,1034,United States,2016,1115.01
30975,"Improved methods to capture the total societal benefits of zoonotic disease control: Demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of an integrated control programme for Taenia solium, soil transmitted helminths and classical swine fever in northern Lao PDR","BACKGROUND: Control and elimination of zoonotic diseases requires robust information about their effect on both human and livestock health in order to enable policy formulation and the allocation of resources. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of controlling Taenia solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in both humans and pigs, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in humans by integrating their control to on-going human and animal health control programmes in northern Lao People''s Democratic Republic. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 49 households, focusing on the prevalence of T. solium taenias/cysticercosis and soil transmitted helminths before and after a twelve month intervention. The village data was collected using a semi-structured questionnaire through a door-to-door survey. The village data was then projected to the wider northern Lao PDR population using stochastic modelling and cost-effectiveness ratio (after aggregating the net cost to capture both human and animal health parameters) and GDP per capita as a threshold, to determine the cost-effectiveness of the integrated control of T. solium taeniasis/ cysticercosis and STH, assuming linear scaling out of the intervention. The zoonotic DALY (zDALY) approach was also used as an alternative method of estimating the cost-effectiveness ratio of controlling T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in humans and pigs. FINDINGS: Using cost-effectiveness analysis after aggregating the net cost and control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis alone as the base case, the study found that simultaneous control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in humans and pigs, STH in humans and Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in pigs was USD 14 per DALY averted and USD 234 per zDALY averted using zDALY method hence considered highly cost-effective whereas controlling T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis without incorporating STH and CSF was the least cost-effective (USD 3,672 per DALY averted). Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of controlling T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in people and pigs using zDALY as an alternative method was USD 3,662 per zDALY averted which was quite close to our findings using the aggregate net cost method. CONCLUSION: The study showed that control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis alone in humans and pigs is not cost-effective in northern Lao PDR whereas control of STH is. Consequently, integrating T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis control with other cost-effective programmes such as STH and CSF markedly improved the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This is especially important in low resource countries where control of zoonotic neglected tropical diseases could be integrated with the human and animal health sectors to optimize use of the limited resources.

The village data was then projected to the wider northern Lao PDR population using stochastic modelling and cost-effectiveness ratio (after aggregating the net cost to capture both human and animal health parameters) and GDP per capita as a threshold, to determine the cost-effectiveness of the integrated control of T. solium taeniasis/ cysticercosis and STH, assuming linear scaling out of the intervention. The zoonotic DALY (zDALY) approach was also used as an alternative method of estimating the cost-effectiveness ratio of controlling T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in humans and pigs. FINDINGS: Using cost-effectiveness analysis after aggregating the net cost and control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis alone as the base case, the study found that simultaneous control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in humans and pigs, STH in humans and Classical Swine Fever (CSF) in pigs was USD 14 per DALY averted and USD 234 per zDALY averted using zDALY method hence considered highly cost-effective whereas controlling T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis without incorporating STH and CSF was the least cost-effective (USD 3,672 per DALY averted). Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of controlling T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis in people and pigs using zDALY as an alternative method was USD 3,662 per zDALY averted which was quite close to our findings using the aggregate net cost method. CONCLUSION: The study showed that control of T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis alone in humans and pigs is not cost-effective in northern Lao PDR whereas control of STH is. Consequently, integrating T. solium taeniasis/cysticercosis control with other cost-effective programmes such as STH and CSF markedly improved the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. This is especially important in low resource countries where control of zoonotic neglected tropical diseases could be integrated with the human and animal health sectors to optimize use of the limited resources.

30979,Economic Evaluation of Using Pesticides to Control Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Isfahan,"Objective: Pesticides have been used as the main part of the national cutaneous leishmaniasis control program for serveral years in Iran. However, the cost-effectiveness of this strategy has not been yet analyzed. The aim of this study is to to analyze the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of using pesticides as the main strategy to prevent rural CL in Isfahan. Methods: This is an economic evaluation study performed from a health system perspective to estimate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the control strategy with and without pesticides. The outcome measures are incidence rate of cutaneous leishmaniasis and the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility have been analyzed by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Data of cost and incidence rate obtained from the health centers of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and Vice-Chancellery for Health. The disability weight was obtained from the literature. A one-way sensitivity analysis was applied with a 20% increase and decrease in costs. Findings: The total cost of control program in 2013 and 2014 were US$578,453 (ppp) and US$14,978.2 (ppp), respectively. The incidence rate of cutaneous leishmaniasis was estimated at 1396 and 1277 (per 100,000 population in hyperendemic areas where pesticides have been used) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. DALY lost due to disease was estimated to be 8.024 and 7.342 in 2013 and 2014, correspondingly. Both the cost-effectiveness and the cost-utility analyses resulted in negative ICERs, lying in the rejection area of the ICER plane. Conclusion: The use of pesticides to prevent cutaneous leishmaniasis (rural sicker) in Isfahan province has not proved to offer a reduction in the incidence rate of cutaneous leishmaniasis as well as reduction in DALYs lost. However, due to data availability limitation, the time frame for this study was limited. A prospective design with longitudinal data is recommended to be used by future research.

30980,Cost-Effectiveness of Scaling Up Modern Family Planning Interventions in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: An Economic Modeling Analysis in Indonesia and Uganda,"OBJECTIVES: The aim was to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of improved family planning interventions to reduce the unmet need in low- and middle-income countries, with Indonesia and Uganda as reference cases. METHODS: The analysis was performed using a Markov decision analytic model, where current situation and several scenarios to reduce the unmet need were incorporated as the comparative strategies. Country-specific evidence was synthesized from the demographic and health survey and published studies. The model simulated the sexual and reproductive health experience of women in the reproductive age range over a time horizon of women''s reproductive years, from the healthcare payer perspective. Modeled outcomes included clinical events, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) expressed as cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of parameter uncertainty on modeled outcomes. RESULTS: In the hypothetical cohort of 100,000 women, scenarios to reduce the unmet need for family planning would result in savings within a range of US$230,600-US$895,100 and US$564,400-US$1,865,900 in Indonesia and Uganda, respectively. The interventions would avert an estimated 1859-3780 and 3705-12,230 DALYs in Indonesia and Uganda, respectively. The results of our analysis indicate that scaling up family planning dominates the current situation in all scenarios in both countries, with lower costs and fewer DALYs. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses.

30996,Is contraceptive self-injection cost-effective compared to contraceptive injections from facility-based health workers? Evidence from Uganda,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of self-injected subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) compared to health-worker-administered intramuscular DMPA (DMPA-IM) in Uganda. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a decision-tree model with a 12-month time horizon for a hypothetical cohort of approximately 1 million injectable contraceptive users in Uganda to estimate the incremental costs per pregnancy averted and per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. The study design derived model inputs from DMPA-SC self-injection continuation and costing research studies and peer-reviewed literature. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from societal and health system perspectives and conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results. RESULTS: Self-injected DMPA-SC could prevent 10,827 additional unintended pregnancies and 1620 maternal DALYs per year for this hypothetical cohort compared to DMPA-IM administered by facility-based health workers. Due to savings in women''s time and travel costs, under a societal perspective, self-injection could save approximately US$1 million or $84,000 per year, depending on the self-injection training aid used. From a health system perspective, self-injection would avert more pregnancies but incur additional costs. A training approach using a one-page client instruction sheet would make self-injection cost-effective compared to DMPA-IM, with incremental costs per pregnancy averted of $15 and per maternal DALY averted of $98. Sensitivity analysis showed that the estimates were robust. The one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the costs of the first visit for self-injection (which include training costs) were an important variable impacting the cost-effectiveness estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Under a societal perspective, self-injected DMPA-SC averted more pregnancies and cost less compared to health-worker-administered DMPA-IM. Under a health system perspective, self-injected DMPA-SC can be cost-effective relative to DMPA-IM when a lower-cost visual aid for client training is used. IMPLICATIONS: Self-injection has economic benefits for women through savings in time and travel costs, and it averts additional pregnancies and maternal disability-adjusted life years compared to health-worker-administered injectable DMPA-IM. Implementing lower-cost approaches to client training can help ensure that self-injection is also cost-effective from a health system perspective.",2018-01-26512,30098940,Contraception,Laura Di Giorgio,2018,/,,No,30098940,"Laura Di Giorgio; Mercy Mvundura; Justine Tumusiime; Chloe Morozoff; Jane Cover; Jennifer Kidwell Drake; Is contraceptive self-injection cost-effective compared to contraceptive injections from facility-based health workers?

30998,Cost-effectiveness and economies of scale of a mass radio campaign to promote household life-saving practices in Burkina Faso,"Introduction: Child health promotion through mass media has not been rigorously evaluated for cost-effectiveness in low-income and middle-income countries. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a mass radio campaign on health-seeking behaviours for child survival within a trial in Burkina Faso and at national scale. Methods: We collected provider cost data prospectively alongside a 35-month cluster randomised trial in rural Burkina Faso in 2012-2015. Out-of-pocket costs of care-seeking were estimated through a household survey. We modelled intervention effects on child survival based on increased care-seeking and estimated the intervention''s incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted versus current practice. Model uncertainty was gauged using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We projected the ICER of national-scale implementation in five sub-Saharan countries with differing media structures. All costs are in 2015 USD. Results: The provider cost of the campaign was $7 749 128 ($9 146 101 including household costs). The campaign broadcast radio spots 74 480 times and 4610 2-hour shows through seven local radio stations, reaching approximately 2.4 million people including 620 000 direct beneficiaries (pregnant women and children under five). It resulted in an average estimated 24% increase in care-seeking for children under five and a 7% reduction in child mortality per year. The ICER was estimated at $94 ($111 including household costs (95% CI -38 to 320)). The projected provider cost per DALY averted of a national level campaign in Burkina Faso, Burundi, Malawi, Mozambique and Niger in 2018-2020, varied between $7 in Malawi to $27 in Burundi. Conclusion: This study suggests that mass-media campaigns can be very cost-effective in improving child survival in areas with high media penetration and can potentially benefit from considerable economies of scale.

30999,Cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of pre-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men in two hospitals in Thailand,"INTRODUCTION: In 2014, the Government of Thailand recommended pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an additional HIV prevention programme within Thailand''s National Guidelines on HIV/AIDS Treatment Prevention. However, to date implementation and uptake of PrEP programmes have been limited, and evidence on the costs and the epidemiological and economic impact is not available. METHODS: We estimated the costs associated with PrEP provision among men having sex with men (MSM) participating in a facility-based, prospective observational cohort study: the Test, Treat and Prevent HIV Programme in Thailand. We created a suite of scenarios to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PrEP and sensitivity of the results to the model input parameters, including PrEP programme effectiveness, PrEP uptake among high-risk and low-risk MSM, baseline and future antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, condom use, unit cost of delivering PrEP, and the discount rate. RESULTS: Drug costs accounted for 82.5% of the total cost of providing PrEP, followed by lab testing (8.2%) and personnel costs (7.8%). The estimated costs of providing the PrEP package in accordance with the national recommendation ranges from US$223 to US$311 per person per year. Based on our modelling results, we estimate that PrEP would be cost-effective when provided to either high-risk or all MSM. However, we found that the programme would be approximately 32% more cost-effective if offered to high-risk MSM than it would be if offered to all MSM, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$4,836 per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted and US$7,089 per DALY averted respectively. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves demonstrate that 80% of scenarios would be cost-effective when PrEP is provided solely to higher-risk MSM. CONCLUSION: We provide the first estimates on cost and cost-effectiveness of PrEP in the Asia-Pacific region, and offer insights on how to deliver PrEP in combination with ART. While the high drug cost poses a budgeting challenge, incorporating PrEP delivery into an existing ART programme could be a cost-effective strategy to prevent HIV infections among MSM in Thailand.",2018-01-26696,30033559,J Int AIDS Soc,Chutima Suraratdecha,2018,21 Suppl 5 /,e25129,No,30033559,"Chutima Suraratdecha; Robyn M Stuart; Chomnad Manopaiboon; Dylan Green; Cheewanan Lertpiriyasuwat; David P Wilson; Patcharaporn Pavaputanon; Prin Visavakum; Patama Monkongdee; Thana Khawcharoenporn; Phiphatthananon Tharee; Chonticha Kittinunvorakoon; Michael Martin; Cost and cost-effectiveness analysis of pre-exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men in two hospitals in Thailand, J Int AIDS Soc, 2018 Jul; 21 Suppl 5():1758-2652; e25129",DALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis vs. None,Men who have sex with men,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,,3.00,3.00,7089,United States,2016,7644.41
