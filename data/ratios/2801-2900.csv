2801,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of new pharmaceuticals in epilepsy in adults: the results of a probabilistic decision model,"Epilepsy currently affects more than 400,000 people in the United Kingdom and 2.3 million in the United States. Drug therapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with epilepsy, but therapies vary widely in their mechanism of action and acquisition cost. This article describes a decision model developed for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom. It compares the long-term cost-effectiveness of drugs licensed in adults for use in 3 situations: monotherapy for newly diagnosed patients, monotherapy for refractory patients, and combination therapy for refractory patients. The analysis separately considers the treatment of partial and generalized seizures. The full range of pharmaceutical therapies feasibly used in the UK health system was included in the analysis. The analysis showed that, on the basis of existing evidence, for newly diagnosed patients with partial seizures, carbamazepine and valproate are likely to be the most cost-effective mono-therapies. Carbamazepine is likely to be the most cost-effective 2nd-line monotherapy for refractory patients, and oxcarbazepine would probably be the most cost-effective adjunctive therapy for refractory patients if the willingness to pay for additional health benefits is greater than pound18,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). For patients with generalized seizures, valproate is most likely to be cost-effective for newly diagnosed patients. For refractory patients, adjunctive topiramate is more cost-effective than monotherapy alone if the willingness to pay for additional health benefits is greater than pound35,000 per QALY.

2805,Acyclovir prophylaxis for pregnant women with a known history of herpes simplex virus: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Previous literature has shown acyclovir to be cost-effective as prophylaxis for women with genital symptomatic herpes simplex virus infection recurrence during pregnancy. We extend this analysis by adding quality-adjusted life year measurements and considering women with a diagnosed history of herpes simplex virus infection but without recurrence in pregnancy. STUDY DESIGN: A decision analytic model was designed that compared acyclovir prophylaxis versus no acyclovir for women with a history of diagnosed genital herpes simplex virus infection but without recurrence in pregnancy. Sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test for robustness. RESULTS: We found that 22,286 women must be treated to prevent 1 neonatal death, 8985 women to prevent 1 affected child, and 177 women to prevent 1 cesarean delivery. As compared with no acyclovir, acyclovir prophylaxis at 36 weeks of gestation saves approximately dollar 20 per person and increases total quality-adjusted life years by 0.01. In univariate sensitivity analysis, this result was robust to all reasonable probability and quality-adjusted life year estimates. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated acyclovir to be cost-effective 100% of the time and cost saving >99% of the time. CONCLUSION: Acyclovir prophylaxis versus no treatment for pregnant women with a diagnosed history of genital herpes simplex virus infection but without recurrence during pregnancy is cost-effective over a wide range of assumptions.",2005-01-01220,16157151,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Sarah E Little,2005,193 / 3 Pt 2,1274-9,No,16157151,"Sarah E Little; Aaron B Caughey; Acyclovir prophylaxis for pregnant women with a known history of herpes simplex virus: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Am J Obstet Gynecol, 2005-Sep; 193(3 Pt 2):0002-9378; 1274-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Acyclovir prophylaxis vs. No acyclovir,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.00,-4651.16,United States,2005,-6163.71
2806,The cost effectiveness of empiric intravenous immunoglobulin for the antepartum treatment of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of empiric intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with that of fetal blood sampling-indicated treatment for the antepartum care of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a decision analysis model to compare the cost effectiveness of 2 strategies for treatment of pregnancies in women with a history of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia and an at-risk fetus: 1) IVIG and corticosteroids as indicated by fetal platelet levels determined by fetal blood sampling (FBS); and 2) empiric IVIG. In the first strategy, FBS is used to measure fetal platelets at 24 weeks of gestation and repeated 6 weeks later to guide pharmacotherapy. In the second strategy, weekly IVIG is empirically administered from 24 weeks' to 37 weeks' gestation. The main outcome measure was the marginal cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. RESULTS: For every 1000 women with a fetus at risk for recurrent alloimmune thrombocytopenia, empiric therapy, compared with FBS-indicated treatment, decreases perinatal deaths from 31.7 to 11.8 while increasing the number of infants with long-term neurologic deficits from 6.1 to 9.6. These health outcomes translate to 382 QALYs gained with empiric therapy and a cost effectiveness ratio of dollar 32,747 per QALY favoring empiric therapy. In the sensitivity analysis, empiric therapy was not cost effective when the rate of perinatal ICH exceeded 28%. CONCLUSION: Empiric IVIG therapy is a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of women at risk for fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia when the rate of perinatal ICH is less than 28%.",2005-01-01221,16157118,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Stephen F Thung,2005,193 / 3 Pt 2,1094-9,No,16157118,"Stephen F Thung; William A Grobman; The cost effectiveness of empiric intravenous immunoglobulin for the antepartum treatment of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, Am J Obstet Gynecol, 2005-Sep; 193(3 Pt 2):0002-9378; 1094-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Empiric IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) and corticosteroids vs. Empiric IVIG,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,32747,United States,2004,44866.51
2807,Incremental cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stents compared with a third-generation bare-metal stent in a real-world setting: randomised Basel Stent Kosten Effektivitäts Trial (BASKET),"BACKGROUND: No prospective trial-based data are available for incremental cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with bare-metal stents (BMS) in unselected patients, as treated in everyday practice. METHODS: The Basel stent cost-effectiveness trial (BASKET) included 826 consecutive patients treated with angioplasty and stenting for 1281 de-novo lesions, irrespective of indication for angioplasty. Patients were randomised to one of two DES (Cypher, n=264; Taxus, n=281) or to a cobalt-chromium-based BMS (Vision, n=281) and followed up for 6 months for occurrence of major adverse cardiac events and costs. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. The primary endpoint was cost-effectiveness after 6 months, with effectiveness defined as reduction of major adverse cardiac events. FINDINGS: Cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularisation occurred in 39 of 544 (7.2%) patients with DES and 34 of 280 (12.1%) with BMS (odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.35-0.91; p=0.02), without significant differences between the two DES. Total costs at 6 months were higher with DES (mean 10,544, SD 6849) than with BMS (9639, 9067; p<0.0001); higher stent costs of DES were not compensated for by lower follow-up costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DES compared with BMS to avoid one major event was 18,311, and costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained were more than 50 000. Subgroup analyses showed that DES were more cost-effective for elderly patients in specific high-risk groups. INTERPRETATION: In a real-world setting, use of DES in all patients is less cost effective than in studies with selected patients. Use of these stents could be restricted to patients in high-risk groups.",2005-01-01222,16154019,Lancet,Christoph Kaiser,2005,366 / 9489,921-9,No,16154019,"Christoph Kaiser; Hans Peter Brunner-La Rocca; Peter T Buser; Piero O Bonetti; Stefan Osswald; André Linka; Alain Bernheim; Andreas Zutter; Michael Zellweger; Leticia Grize; Matthias E Pfisterer; Incremental cost-effectiveness of drug-eluting stents compared with a third-generation bare-metal stent in a real-world setting: randomised Basel Stent Kosten Effektivitäts Trial (BASKET), Lancet, 2005-Sep-10; 366(9489):0140-6736; 921-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Drug-eluting stents vs. Bare-metal stents,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,54546,Euro,2003,86855.29
2808,Cost effectiveness of dalteparin for preventing venous thromboembolism in abdominal surgery,"INTRODUCTION: Patients undergoing abdominal surgeries face substantial risk of experiencing venous thromboembolic events in the perioperative period. The low-molecular-weight heparin dalteparin sodium is clinically effective in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in these patients. Dalteparin may be used in low (2500 units [U]) and high (5000U) once-daily doses for this indication. However, the cost effectiveness of dalteparin 5000U compared with dalteparin 2500U and unfractionated heparin (UFH) for this indication has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-utility analysis to evaluate the cost effectiveness of dalteparin compared with UFH for preventing VTE in patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery. METHODS: A Markov model, from a healthcare perspective, was constructed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of dalteparin 5000U and dalteparin 2500U compared with UFH. A 69-year-old mixed sex patient population was studied using pooled probabilities of clinical outcomes from randomised, controlled trials. Cost data were mostly derived from Medicare reimbursement, in year 2002-03 values. Cost effectiveness was measured as cost per QALY gained over the patient's lifetime. RESULTS: Total costs for patients given UFH, dalteparin 2500U and dalteparin 5000U were $US45 855, $US45 882 and $US46 308, respectively, while QALYs were 9.5603, 9.5632 and 9.5811, respectively. Hence, the incremental cost effectiveness of dalteparin 5000U over dalteparin 2500U and UFH was $US23 799/QALY and $US21 779/QALY gained, respectively. Similarly, cost effectiveness for dalteparin 2500U over UFH was $US9310/QALY gained. Univariate sensitivity analysis showed that dalteparin 5000U maintained its cost effectiveness (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] <$US50 000/QALY gained) over the other two regimens for a wide range of cost and effectiveness estimates. Acceptability curves based on the results of Monte Carlo simulation (50 000 patients) showed that dalteparin 5000U would achieve cost effectiveness for 90% of patients at values close to $US230 000/QALY. Dalteparin 2500U was less effective than UFH for patients aged <63 years. CONCLUSION: Even though our base-case analysis seems to show that dalteparin 5000U is cost effective compared with dalteparin 2500U and UFH for prophylaxis of VTE in patients undergoing abdominal surgery, Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that this was the case for only about 50% of the patients if the threshold for cost effectiveness is set at $US50 000 per QALY gained. Furthermore, there was substantial uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness results.

2811,Cost effectiveness of treatment for alcohol problems: findings of the randomised UK alcohol treatment trial (UKATT),"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of social behaviour and network therapy, a new treatment for alcohol problems, with that of the proved motivational enhancement therapy. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis alongside a pragmatic randomised trial. SETTING: Seven treatment sites around Birmingham, Cardiff, and Leeds. PARTICIPANTS: 742 clients with alcohol problems; 617 (83.2%) were interviewed at 12 months and full economic data were obtained on 608 (98.5% of 617). Main economic measures Quality adjusted life years (QALYs), costs of trial treatments, and consequences for public sector resources (health care, other alcohol treatment, social services, and criminal justice services). RESULTS: Both therapies saved about five times as much in expenditure on health, social, and criminal justice services as they cost. Neither net savings nor cost effectiveness differed significantly between the therapies, despite the average cost of social behaviour and network therapy (221 pounds sterling; 385 dollars; 320 euros) being significantly more than that of motivational enhancement therapy (129 pounds sterling).

2812,A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility study of lung transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Life-threatening complications and expensive posttransplantation medical care raises the issue whether lung transplantation (L-Tx) is cost effective. We studied, from a health care system perspective, the cost effectiveness (C/E) and cost utility (C/U) of L-Tx in a Canadian setting. METHODS: An incremental C/E and C/U analysis of L-Tx, compared with the waiting list (WL), was carried out on 124 patients accepted into the Quebec L-Tx WL (1997-2001). Survival was presented in mean life-years (LYs). Utility, assessed with the standard gamble, was used in computing the quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Different person-time experiences were simulated. Costs (95% confidence interval), in US dollars, were discounted at 5%. RESULTS: The mean LYs and QALYs gained were 0.57 (0.36-0.78) and 0.62 (0.36-0.78), respectively. The cost per patient without Tx was $1102 ($856-$1348) per month. The L-Tx program induced a screening cost of $6208 per patient. The cost of the L-Tx procedure (n = 91) was $31,815 ($25,301-$44,816). The post-Tx cost per month in the first, second, third, and fourth year was $1809 ($1187-$2446), $1060 ($703-$1478), $1128 ($519-$1735), and $626 ($495-$758), respectively. The projected C/E and C/U of the L-Tx program, assessed on the basis of pre- and post-Tx extrapolations, reached $40,048 and $46,631, respectively.

2814,Coronary Calcium Independently Predicts Incident Premature Coronary Heart Disease Over Measured Cardiovascular Risk Factors Mean Three-Year Outcomes in the Prospective Army Coronary Calcium (PACC) Project,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the independent predictive value of coronary artery calcium detection for coronary outcomes in a non-referred cohort of healthy men and women ages 40 to 50 years. BACKGROUND: Existing studies have suggested that coronary calcium might have incremental predictive value for coronary outcomes above standard coronary risk factors. However, additional data from non-referred and younger populations are needed. METHODS: Participants (n = 2,000; mean age 43 years) were evaluated with measured coronary risk variables and coronary calcium detected with electron beam tomography. Incident acute coronary syndromes and sudden cardiac death were ascertained via annual telephonic contacts, with follow-up (mean, 3.0 +/- 1.4 years; range, 1 to 6 years) in 99.2% of the cohort. RESULTS: Coronary calcium was found in 22.4% of men and 7.9% of women. A total of 9 acute events occurred in men at a mean age of 46 years, including 7 of 364 men with coronary calcium (1.95%) and 2 of 1,263 men without coronary calcium (0.16%; p < 0.0001 by log-rank). No events occurred in women. In these men, coronary calcium was associated with an 11.8-fold increased risk for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) (p = 0.002) in a Cox model controlling for the Framingham risk score. Among those with coronary artery calcification, the risk of coronary events increased incrementally across tertiles of coronary calcium severity (hazard ratio 4.3 per tertile). A family history of premature CHD was also predictive of incident events. The marginal cost effectiveness, assuming a 30% improvement in survival associated with primary prevention among at-risk men, was modeled to be $37,633 per quality-adjusted life year saved. CONCLUSIONS: In young, asymptomatic men, the presence of coronary artery calcification provides substantial, cost-effective, independent prognostic value in predicting incident CHD that is incremental to measured coronary risk factors.",2005-01-01233,16139129,J Am Coll Cardiol,Allen J Taylor,2005,46 / 5,807-14,No,16139129,"Allen J Taylor; Jody Bindeman; Irwin Feuerstein; Felix Cao; Michael Brazaitis; Patrick G O'malley; Coronary Calcium Independently Predicts Incident Premature Coronary Heart Disease Over Measured Cardiovascular Risk Factors Mean Three-Year Outcomes in the Prospective Army Coronary Calcium (PACC) Project, J Am Coll Cardiol, 2005-Sep-06; 46(5):0735-1097; 807-14",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Electron beam computed tomography vs. Conventional risk prediction assesment,Not Stated,50 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,37633,United States,2003,52933.88
2815,Prophylactic Cholecystectomy in Transplant Patients: A Decision Analysis,"Prophylactic laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed in solid organ transplant patients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis. Modeled, decision analytic techniques were used to evaluate the different management strategies for asymptomatic cholelithiasis in cardiac and pancreas/renal transplant recipients. The clinical outcomes of expectant management, pretransplantation prophylactic cholecystectomy, and posttransplantation prophylactic cholecystectomy were analyzed for each population. The probabilities and outcomes were derived form a pooled analysis of published studies. One- and two-way sensitivity and cost analyses were performed. Prophylactic posttransplantation cholecystectomy is favored for cardiac transplant recipients with asymptomatic cholelithiasis, resulting in 5:1000 deaths versus 80:1000 for pretransplantation cholecystectomy and 44:1000 for expectant management. In distinction, expectant management for asymptomatic cholelithiasis is favored in pancreas/renal transplant patients, resulting in 2:1000 deaths compared with 5:1000 for prophylactic cholecystectomy. After heart transplantation, a strategy of routine, prophylactic cholecystectomy is anticipated to result in a cost savings of $17,779 per quality-adjusted life-year. Prophylactic posttransplantation cholecystectomy is the preferred management strategy for cardiac transplant patients with incidental gallstones, resulting in decreased mortality and significant cost savings per quality-adjusted life-year.

2816,Impact of adhesive capsulitis and economic evaluation of high-grade and low-grade mobilisation techniques,"The purpose of this study was to estimate the impact of adhesive capsulitis on costs and health and to compare the cost-utility of high-grade and low-grade mobilisation techniques. In a randomised controlled trial, 92 patients with adhesive capsulitis received either high-grade mobilisation techniques or low-grade mobilisation techniques and were followed for one year. Outcome measures were quality adjusted life years (QALYs) according to the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) and societal costs estimated from cost questionnaires. Estimated costs and QALYs in both randomisation groups were similar, except for the number of treatment sessions (18.6 for high-grade mobilisation techniques versus 21.5 for low-grade mobilisation techniques), with an estimated cost difference of 105 euros in favour of high-grade mobilisation techniques (p = 0.001, 95% CI 43 euros to 158 euros). In the entire sample, the average valuation of health improved from 0.597 at baseline to 0.745 after a year. The burden due to adhesive capsulitis was estimated at 0.048 QALY and 4,521 euros per patient. About half these costs were due to absenteeism which, during the first quarter, amounted to 38% of the total working hours. In conclusion, the cost-utility analysis does not allow for an evidence-based recommendation on the preferred treatment. Based on the clinical outcome measures, high-grade mobilisation techniques are still preferred to low-grade mobilisation techniques. The estimated substantial burden, both to the patient and to society, suggests that effective early treatment of adhesive capsulitis is warranted to attempt to accelerate recovery.",2005-01-01235,16137239,Aust J Physiother,Wilbert B van den Hout,2005,51 / 3,141-9,No,16137239,"Wilbert B van den Hout; Henricus M Vermeulen; Piet M Rozing; Thea P M Vliet Vlieland; Impact of adhesive capsulitis and economic evaluation of high-grade and low-grade mobilisation techniques, Aust J Physiother, 2005; 51(3):0004-9514; 141-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,High-grade (Grade III-IV) mobilization technique vs. Low-grade (Grade II) mobilization technique,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2711428.75,Euro,2004,-4620673.88

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative cost-effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) with autograft, allograft, and allograft with plating for single-level anterior cervical spondylosis. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There are several accepted methods of surgically treating single-level cervical spondylosis anteriorly. No study has clearly demonstrated the superiority of one method over the alternatives. The techniques may differ in their operative risks and resource use, perioperative complications, short-term outcome, and long-term outcome and complications. Formal cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) provides a structure for analyzing many variables and comparing different treatment outcomes. Sensitivity analysis is used to test the robustness of the model and to determine variables that have significant effects on the results. Future areas of research and refinements of the CEA model can be developed from these findings. METHODS: A retrospective review of hospital charges was performed for 78 patients who underwent single-level ACDF with allograft alone or ACDF with allograft and plating (ACDFP). The charges were converted to estimated costs for fiscal year 2000 using the ratio of costs to charges method. A CEA model was developed consisting of a decision-analysis model for the first year postsurgery and a Markov model for the next 4 years after surgery. Probabilities and outcome utilities were estimated from the literature. Outcome was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental CEA was performed. Several variables were tested in one-way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Compared with ACDF with autograft, ACDF with allograft offered an improvement in quality of life at a cost of 496 dollars per QALY. ACDFP provided additional gains in quality of life compared with ACDF with allograft at a cost of 32,560 dollars per QALY in the base case analysis. In sensitivity analysis, these estimates varied between 417 dollars and 741 dollars per QALY and between 19,090 dollars per QALY and domination of ACDFP by ACDF with allograft, respectively. The results were most sensitive to assumptions regarding differences in the length of the postoperative recovery period. CONCLUSIONS: ACDF with allograft offers a benefit relative to ACDF with autograft at a cost of 496 dollars per QALY. ACDFP has a benefit relative to ACDF with allograft at an approximate cost of 32,560 dollars per QALY. CEA provides a method for comparing the benefits and risks of these three procedures.

2819,Cost-effectiveness of isoniazid chemoprevention in close contacts,"The aim of the present study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis in young and middle-aged adults with latent tuberculosis (TB) infection in Germany. A Markov model simulated the progression of 20- and 40-yr-old close contacts of active TB cases over 20 yrs. Health and economic outcomes of isoniazid (INH) chemoprevention versus no intervention were compared. The analysis determined the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year and the difference between numbers of TB cases and of TB-related deaths. INH chemoprevention prevented 79% of expected TB cases in both age groups, and saved 9,482 and 9,142 in the lower and higher age groups, respectively, per case prevented. Quality-adjusted life expectancy was slightly extended by 8 days in the lower age group and 7 days in the higher age group, at a cost saving of 417 and 375, respectively, per person. Annual savings were 20,862 and 18,742 per 1,000 contacts, respectively. The number needed to be treated to prevent one TB case in the lower age group was 23 and 25 in the higher age group. The programme also prevented three TB-related deaths in the younger and two in the older cohort. The results are highly sensitive to treatment-cost assumptions.

2821,Potential cost-effective use of spine radiographs to detect vertebral deformity and select osteopenic post-menopausal women for amino-bisphosphonate therapy,"Prevalent vertebral deformities are predictive of future clinical fractures independent of bone density. We used a Markov model with eight health states to estimate from the societal perspective the cost-effectiveness of using spine radiographs to identify postmenopausal women age 60 or older with one or more vertebral deformities and then treat them with anti-resorptive drug therapy to prevent fractures. We compared three strategies: 5 years of amino-bisphosphonate (alendronate) therapy for all, 5 years of alendronate therapy for only those with prevalent a radiographic vertebral deformity or no initial alendronate treatment. Lifetime direct medical and indirect costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were tracked. For women with one or more prevalent vertebral deformities, the costs per QALY gained ranged from $5,084 (for an 80 year old with a T-score of -2.4) to $61,192 (for a 60 year old with a T-score of -1.0). For women without prevalent vertebral deformity, the costs per QALY gained ranged from $41,897 (for a 60 year old with a T-score of -2.4) to $166,219 (for an 80 year old with a T-score of -1.0). These results were modestly sensitive to reasonable changes in fracture rates, disutility, discount rates and assumptions about the accuracy of spinal radiographs for detecting vertebral deformity. Assuming a societal willingness to pay per QALY gained of $50,000, the strategy of performing spine radiographs in post-menopausal osteopenic women with T-scores at or below -1.5 and treating those with 1 or more prevalent vertebral deformities is likely to be cost-effective. However, further research on the accuracy of vertebral deformity ascertainment from routine clinical radiographs and on the efficacy of amino-bisphosphonate drugs for reducing the risk of non-vertebral fractures in osteopenic women is needed to define more precisely the subset of osteopenic post-menopausal women in whom use of spinal radiographs is most cost-effective.",2005-01-01238,16133649,Osteoporos Int,John Schousboe,2005,/,,No,16133649,"John Schousboe; Kristine Ensrud; John Nyman; Robert Kane; L Melton; Potential cost-effective use of spine radiographs to detect vertebral deformity and select osteopenic post-menopausal women for amino-bisphosphonate therapy, Osteoporos Int, 2005-Aug-31; ():0937-941X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Alendronate therapy vs. No initial therapy,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,54452,United States,2001,79575.25

2823,Potential cost-effective use of spine radiographs to detect vertebral deformity and select osteopenic post-menopausal women for amino-bisphosphonate therapy,"Prevalent vertebral deformities are predictive of future clinical fractures independent of bone density. We used a Markov model with eight health states to estimate from the societal perspective the cost-effectiveness of using spine radiographs to identify postmenopausal women age 60 or older with one or more vertebral deformities and then treat them with anti-resorptive drug therapy to prevent fractures. We compared three strategies: 5 years of amino-bisphosphonate (alendronate) therapy for all, 5 years of alendronate therapy for only those with prevalent a radiographic vertebral deformity or no initial alendronate treatment. Lifetime direct medical and indirect costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were tracked. For women with one or more prevalent vertebral deformities, the costs per QALY gained ranged from $5,084 (for an 80 year old with a T-score of -2.4) to $61,192 (for a 60 year old with a T-score of -1.0). For women without prevalent vertebral deformity, the costs per QALY gained ranged from $41,897 (for a 60 year old with a T-score of -2.4) to $166,219 (for an 80 year old with a T-score of -1.0). These results were modestly sensitive to reasonable changes in fracture rates, disutility, discount rates and assumptions about the accuracy of spinal radiographs for detecting vertebral deformity. Assuming a societal willingness to pay per QALY gained of $50,000, the strategy of performing spine radiographs in post-menopausal osteopenic women with T-scores at or below -1.5 and treating those with 1 or more prevalent vertebral deformities is likely to be cost-effective.

2824,The cost-effectiveness of early noninvasive ventilation for ALS patients,"BACKGROUND: Optimal timing of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) initiation in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unknown, but NIPPV appears to benefit ALS patients who are symptomatic from pulmonary insufficiency. This has prompted research proposals of earlier NIPPV initiation in the ALS disease course in an attempt to further improve ALS patient quality of life and perhaps survival. We therefore used a cost-utility analysis to determine a priori what magnitude of health-related quality of life (HRQL) improvement early NIPPV initiation would need to achieve to be cost-effective in a future clinical trial. METHODS: Using a Markov decision analytic model we calculated the benefit in health-state utility that NIPPV initiated at ALS diagnosis must achieve to be cost-effective. The primary outcome was the percent utility gained through NIPPV in relation to two common willingness-to-pay thresholds: 50,000 dollars and 100,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Our results indicate that if NIPPV begun at the time of diagnosis improves ALS patient HRQL as little as 13.5%, it would be a cost-effective treatment. Tolerance of NIPPV (assuming a 20% improvement in HRQL) would only need to exceed 18% in our model for treatment to remain cost-effective using a conservative willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000 dollars per QALY. CONCLUSION: If early use of NIPPV in ALS patients is shown to improve HRQL in future studies, it is likely to be a cost-effective treatment. Clinical trials of NIPPV begun at the time of ALS diagnosis are therefore warranted from a cost-effectiveness standpoint.",2005-01-01239,16131401,BMC Health Serv Res,Kirsten L Gruis,2005,5 /,58,Yes,16131401,"Kirsten L Gruis; Michael E Chernew; Devin L Brown; The cost-effectiveness of early noninvasive ventilation for ALS patients, BMC Health Serv Res, 2005-Aug-30; 5():1472-6963; 58",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) vs. No NIPPV,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,33801,United States,2004,46310.59
2825,Cost-effectiveness of memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease entails enormous costs for society and impairs quality of life for patients and caregivers. OBJECTIVE: This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of memantine in the treatment of patients with moderately severe to severe cognitive impairment from Alzheimer's disease in Sweden. METHODS: The study was based on published data from several sources, including a randomized controlled trial of memantine versus placebo and a longitudinal observational study of Alzheimer's disease patients in Sweden. Costs were estimated from the public payer's perspective, including direct costs but excluding costs of informal care, and resource utilization data were taken from the observational study. Cost-effectiveness was quantified as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from treatment with the use of previously published utility weights. A Markov simulation model was constructed, incorporating the effect of treatment on cognitive function, physical dependence related to activities of daily living, and institutionalization. Costs and effects for treated and untreated patients were estimated for 5 years (10 cycles). In the base-case analysis, treatment costs were added for 2 years, but the effect on transition probabilities was applied only for the first year of treatment. RESULTS: Compared with no treatment, memantine treatment was predicted to be associated with lower costs of care, longer time to dependence and institutionalization, and gains in QALYs. Treatment was estimated to decrease formal care costs by 123,600 Swedish kronor (SEK) and, after taking into account the cost of memantine, to lead to net cost savings of 100,528 SEK per patient. Treated patients gained 0.148 QALY over the 5-year simulation. CONCLUSIONS: From a public payer's perspective, the observed effect of memantine on cognitive and physical function is predicted to translate into economic benefits that offset the added treatment cost. Treatment is also predicted to delay institutionalization, improve independence, and increase QALYs.",2005-01-01241,16129384,Am J Geriatr Pharmacother,Linus Jönsson,2005,3 / 2,77-86,No,16129384,"Linus Jönsson; Cost-effectiveness of memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease in Sweden, Am J Geriatr Pharmacother, 2005-Jun; 3(2):1543-5946; 77-86",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Memantine therapy vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,Not Stated,-679243.24,Sweden,2004,-126865.27
2826,Cost and health status analysis after autologous chondrocyte implantation and mosaicplasty: a retrospective comparison,"OBJECTIVES: Chondral defects of the knee cartilage are prevalent. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) and mosaicplasty are increasingly used to treat symptomatic knee defects. This study assessed the costs and health status outcomes after ACI and mosaicplasty. METHODS: Patients were eligible to participate in this cross-sectional study if they received ACI or mosaicplasty at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital between 1997 and 2001 or were on a waiting list for ACI. Secondary-care resource use was collected to 2 years postoperatively using a resource collection proforma. Participants responded to postal questions about sociodemographic characteristics and knee-related (Modified Cincinnati Knee Rating System) and general health status (EQ-5D). RESULTS: Fifty-three ACI, twenty mosaicplasty, and twenty-two patients waiting for ACI participated. The average cost per patient was higher for ACI (10,600 pounds sterling: 95 percent confidence interval [CI], 10,036 pounds sterling-11,214 pounds sterling) than mosaicplasty (7,948 pounds sterling: 95 percent CI, 6,957 pounds sterling-9,243 pounds sterling). Postoperatively, ACI and mosaicplasty patients (combined) experienced better health status than those waiting for ACI. ACI patients tended to have better health status outcomes than mosaicplasty patients (not statistically significant). Estimated average EQ-5D social tariff improvements for quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculations were 0.23 (ACI) and 0.06 (mosaicplasty). Average costs per QALY were 23,043 pounds sterling (ACI) and 66,233 pounds sterling (mosaicplasty). The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for providing ACI over mosaicplasty was 16,349 pounds sterling. CONCLUSIONS: Average costs were higher for ACI than mosaicplasty. However, both the estimated cost per QALY and ICER for providing ACI over mosaicplasty fell beneath an implicit English funding threshold of 30,000 pounds sterling per QALY. Prospective studies should include measures of utility to confirm the estimated cost utility ratios of ACI and mosaicplasty.",2005-01-01248,16110716,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Sarah Derrett,2005,21 / 3,359-67,No,16110716,"Sarah Derrett; Elizabeth A Stokes; Marilyn James; William Bartlett; George Bentley; Cost and health status analysis after autologous chondrocyte implantation and mosaicplasty: a retrospective comparison, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2005; 21(3):0266-4623; 359-67",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Autologous chondrocyte implantation vs. Mosaicplasty,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,16349,United Kingdom,2003,37590.88
2827,Spinal cord stimulation for failed back surgery syndrome: a decision-analytic model and cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to develop a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS), relative to nonsurgical conventional medical management (CMM), for patients with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). METHODS: A decision tree and Markov model were developed to synthesize evidence on both health-care costs and outcomes for patients with FBSS. Outcome data of SCS and CMM were sourced from 2-year follow-up data of two randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Treatment effects were measured as levels of pain relief. Short- and long-term health-care costs were obtained from a detailed Canadian costing study in FBSS patients. Results are presented as incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and expressed in 2003 Euros. Costs were discounted at 6 percent and outcomes at 1.5 percent. RESULTS: Over the lifetime of the patient, SCS was dominant (i.e., SCS is cost-saving and gives more health gain relative to CMM); a finding that was robust across sensitivity analyses. At a 2-year time horizon, SCS gave more health gain but at an increased cost relative to CMM. Given the uncertainty in effectiveness and cost parameters, the 2-year cost-effectiveness of SCS ranged from 30,370 Euros in the base case to 63,511 Euros in the worst-case scenario. CONCLUSIONS: SCS was found to be both more effective and less costly than CMM, over the lifetime of a patient. In the short-term, although SCS is potentially cost-effective, the model results are highly sensitive to the choice of input parameters. Further empirical data are required to improve the precision in the estimation of short-term cost-effectiveness.",2005-01-01249,16110715,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Rebecca J Taylor,2005,21 / 3,351-8,No,16110715,"Rebecca J Taylor; Rod S Taylor; Spinal cord stimulation for failed back surgery syndrome: a decision-analytic model and cost-effectiveness analysis, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2005; 21(3):0266-4623; 351-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Spinal cord stimulation vs. Nonsurgical conventional medical management,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,1.50,-41934.82,Euro,2003,-66774.12
2828,Cost-effectiveness of pressure-relieving devices for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers,"OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of alternating pressure-relieving devices, mattress replacements, and mattress overlays compared with a standard hospital (high-specification foam mattress) for the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers in hospital patients in the United Kingdom was investigated. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to evaluate different strategies to prevent or treat pressure ulcers. Three scenarios were evaluated: the prevention of pressure ulcers, the treatment of superficial ulcers, and the treatment of severe ulcers. Epidemiological and effectiveness data were obtained from the clinical literature. Expert opinion using a rating scale technique was used to obtain quality of life data. Costs of the devices were obtained from manufacturers, whereas costs of treatment were obtained from the literature. Uncertainty was explored through probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Using 30,000 pounds sterling/QALY (quality-adjusted life year) as the decision-maker's cut off point (the current UK standard), in scenario 1 (prevention), the cost-effective strategy was the mattress overlay at 1, 4, and 12 weeks. In scenarios 2 and 3, the cost-effective strategy was the mattress replacement at 1, 4, and 12 weeks. Standard care was a dominated intervention in all scenarios for values of the decision-maker's ceiling ratio ranging from 5,000 pounds sterling to 100,000 pounds sterling/QALY.

2834,Economic analysis of a phase III clinical trial evaluating the addition of total androgen suppression to radiation versus radiation alone for locally advanced prostate cancer (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group protocol 86-10),"Purpose: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding hormone therapy to radiation for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer, using a Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov Model. Methods and Materials: Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) protocol 86-10 randomized patients to receive radiation therapy (RT) alone or RT plus total androgen suppression (RTHormones) 2 months before and during RT for the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer. A Markov model was designed with Data Pro (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA). The analysis took a payer's perspective. Transition probabilities from one state of health (i.e., with no disease progression or with hormone-responsive metastatic disease) to another were calculated from published rates pertaining to RTOG 86-10. Patients remained in one state of health for 1 year. Utility values for each health state and treatment were obtained from the literature. Distributions were sampled at random from the treatment utilities according to a second-order Monte Carlo simulation technique. Results: The mean expected cost for the RT-only treatments was $29,240 (range, $29,138-$29,403). The mean effectiveness for the RT-only treatment was 5.48 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (range, 5.47-5.50). The mean expected cost for RTHormones was $31,286 (range, $31,058-$31,555). The mean effectiveness was 6.43 QALYs (range, 6.42-6.44). Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis showed RTHormones to be within the range of cost-effectiveness at $2,153/QALY. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analysis resulted in a >80% probability that RTHormones is cost-effective.

2835,Cost-effectiveness of topiramate in migraine prevention: results from a pharmacoeconomic model of topiramate treatment,"Objective.-Patients whose migraines are frequent, cause disruptions of daily routines, or are unresponsive to acute treatment are primary candidates for preventive migraine therapy. This cost-effectiveness model assesses the clinical and economic impact of topiramate (TPM) therapy versus no preventive treatment for migraine headache in the United States. Background.-Despite significant progress in treatment options, the economic burden of migraine to patients, employers, health systems, and society is substantial. Treatment strategies for migraine are directed toward managing acute episodes. However, preventive therapy should be used for patients with frequent migraine attacks (>2 per month) or those experiencing attacks that disrupt daily routines. Methods.-Data for the model were obtained from the published literature and pooled results of two randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials of TPM in migraine prevention. Model inputs included baseline migraine frequency (the base case assumed 6 per month, consistent with the average rate in the TPM trials), treatment discontinuation (including discontinuation due to adverse events), treatment response (ie, >/=75%, 50% to 75%, and <50% reduction in migraine frequency), cost of preventive therapy (TPM plus physician visits for medication titration), cost of acute treatment per attack (including pharmacy and medical service costs), hours of disability per attack, hourly wage, and quality-of-life (utility) weights. Model outcomes included the number of migraines averted, disability hours, total cost of acute and preventive treatment, and lost wages. Results were expressed as cost per migraine averted and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). All costs were stated as 2002 U.S. dollars. We also conducted sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of model findings with respect to variation in key parameters. Results.-We estimated that the use of TPM would prevent 1.85 migraines per patient and almost 5 hours of disability per month versus no preventive treatment. Resulting savings in cost of acute treatment ($27) and work loss ($51) offset 68% of the expected monthly cost of TPM ($113). The incremental cost per migraine averted was $19, while the incremental cost per QALY was estimated to be $10,888 ($26,191 when indirect costs were excluded from the analysis). Model results were sensitive to baseline migraine rate and gain in health utility from migraine prevention. Conclusions.-Economic savings associated with reduced migraine frequency offset approximately two thirds of the cost of preventive TPM therapy. The cost-effectiveness of TPM depends on utility gains associated with a reduced frequency of migraine headaches, which is the subject of ongoing research. However, results from our model suggest that the use of TPM in prevention of migraine may offer reasonable value for money relative to many well-accepted medical interventions.

2836,Health-economic comparison of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with multiple daily injection for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes in the UK,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to project the long-term costs and outcomes of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) in patients with Type 1 diabetes in the UK. METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model is a peer-reviewed, validated model which employs standard Markov/Monte Carlo simulation techniques to describe the long-term incidence and progression of diabetes-related complications. It was used to simulate disease progression in a cohort of patients with baseline characteristics taken from published UK studies (mean age 26 years, duration of diabetes 12 years, mean HbA1c 8.68%). Direct costs for 2003 were calculated from a third-party payer perspective. Discount rates of 3.0% per annum were applied to costs and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Treatment with CSII was associated with an improvement in mean quality adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of 0.76 +/- 0.19 years compared with MDI (12.03 +/- 0.15 vs. 11.27 +/- 0.14 years). Mean direct lifetime costs were pounds 19,407 +/- 1727 higher with CSII treatment compared with MDI (pounds 80,511 +/- 1257 vs. pounds 61,104 +/- 1249). This produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pounds 25,648 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with CSII vs. MDI. The results were most sensitive to variation in hypoglycaemia rates and altering improvements in HbA1c associated with CSII therapy compared with MDI. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in glycaemic control associated with CSII over MDI led to improved QALE owing to reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications. CSII was associated with an ICER of pounds 25,648 per QALY gained vs. MDI, representing good value for money by current standards in the UK.",2005-01-01255,16108855,Diabet Med,S Roze,2005,22 / 9,1239-45,No,16108855,"S Roze; W J Valentine; K E Zakrzewska; A J Palmer; Health-economic comparison of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with multiple daily injection for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes in the UK, Diabet Med, 2005-Sep; 22(9):0742-3071; 1239-45",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) vs. Multiple daily injections (MDI),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,25648,United Kingdom,2003,58971.86
2837,Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of strategies for managing people at high risk for diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Lifestyle modification can forestall diabetes in high-risk people, but the long-term cost-effectiveness is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effects of the lifestyle modification program used in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) on health and economic outcomes. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using the Archimedes model. DATA SOURCES: Published basic and epidemiologic studies, clinical trials, and Kaiser Permanente administrative data. TARGET POPULATION: Adults at high risk for diabetes (body mass index >24 kg/m2, fasting plasma glucose level of 5.2725 to 6.9375 mmol/L [95 to 125 mg/dL], 2-hour glucose tolerance test result of 7.77 to 11.0445 mmol/L [140 to 199 mg/dL]). TIME HORIZON: 5 to 30 years. PERSPECTIVE: Patient, health plan, and societal. INTERVENTIONS: No prevention, DPP's lifestyle modification program, lifestyle modification begun after a person develops diabetes, and metformin. MEASUREMENTS: Diagnosis and complications of diabetes. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with no prevention program, the DPP lifestyle program would reduce a high-risk person's 30-year chances of getting diabetes from about 72% to 61%, the chances of a serious complication from about 38% to 30%, and the chances of dying of a complication of diabetes from about 13.5% to 11.2%. Metformin would deliver about one third the long-term health benefits achievable by immediate lifestyle modification. Compared with not implementing any prevention program, the expected 30-year cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of the DPP lifestyle intervention from the health plan's perspective would be about 143,000 dollars. From a societal perspective, the cost/QALY of the lifestyle intervention compared with doing nothing would be about 62,600 dollars. Either using metformin or delaying the lifestyle intervention until after a person develops diabetes would be more cost-effective, costing about 35,400 dollars or 24,500 dollars per QALY gained, respectively, compared with no program. Compared with delaying the lifestyle program until after diabetes is diagnosed, the marginal cost-effectiveness of beginning the DPP lifestyle program immediately would be about 201,800 dollars. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Variability and uncertainty deriving from the structure of the model were tested by comparing the model's results with the results of real clinical trials of diabetes and its complications. The most critical element of uncertainty is the effectiveness of the lifestyle program, as expressed by the 95% CI of the DPP study. The most important potentially controllable factor is the cost of the lifestyle program. Compared with no program, lifestyle modification for high-risk people can be made cost-saving over 30 years if the annual cost of the intervention can be reduced to about 100 dollars. LIMITATIONS: Results depend on the accuracy of the model. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle modification is likely to have important effects on the morbidity and mortality of diabetes and should be recommended to all high-risk people.

2844,An economic evaluation of rizatriptan in the treatment of migraine,"BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common, chronic, neurovascular disorder, generally characterised by attacks of severe headache and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Triptans are selective serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists that represent effective therapeutic options for moderate-to-severe migraine attacks but with higher acquisition costs relative to usual care therapies. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the cost effectiveness of rizatriptan treatment compared with 'Usual Care' or other triptans available in Canada for patients with moderate-to-severe migraine for whom other therapies (e.g. NSAIDs, simple analgesics) are insufficient or contraindicated. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was created to estimate migraine treatment costs over a 24-hour period in patients with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe migraine as defined by the International Headache Society criteria. Costs and clinical outcomes were observed over a 24-hour period from therapy initiation. Efficacy measures consisted of 'pain-free response at 2 hours' and 'sustained pain free for 2-24 hours'. Oral rizatriptan 10mg was compared with other oral triptans (i.e. sumatriptan 50 or 100mg), naratriptan 2.5mg and zolmitriptan 2.5mg, based on a meta-analysis and compared with 'Usual Care' based on a naturalistic study of people who experience migraine and who were similar to the target population. 'Usual Care' was defined as an aggregate of medications prescribed for the Canadian population for the indication of migraine, weighted by the relative frequency of use of prescriptions over a 1-year period. Analyses were conducted from the Ontario (Canada) Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (MOH&LTC) perspective and the broader societal perspective. Results are presented as the cost per migraine attack aborted (i.e. pain free at 2 hours), as well as the cost per QALY. Several one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. All costs are expressed in 2002 $Can. RESULTS: Cost estimates are similar to previously published Canadian studies. Rizatriptan compared with 'Usual Care' produced an incremental cost per attack aborted of $Can49.82 and a cost per QALY gained of $Can31 845 from the MOH&LTC perspective. When a societal perspective was considered (which included time loss from paid and unpaid work activities), rizatriptan dominates 'Usual Care': that is, it is cost saving and more effective. All other triptans are also dominated by rizatriptan as they offer higher costs and lower efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that rizatriptan treatment for patients who experience moderate-to-severe migraines may represent a cost-effective strategy for improving care of migraine patients in Canada.",2005-01-01263,16097844,Pharmacoeconomics,Melissa Thompson,2005,23 / 8,837-50,Yes,16097844,"Melissa Thompson; Marek Gawel; Brigitte Desjardins; Nicole Ferko; Daniel Grima; An economic evaluation of rizatriptan in the treatment of migraine, Pharmacoeconomics, 2005; 23(8):1179-2027; 837-50",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral rizatriptan vs. Usual care and other oral triptans,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,0 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,31845,Canada,2002,29179.46
2845,Economic evaluation of temozolomide in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme,"BACKGROUND: Temozolomide (TMZ) is an oral alkylating agent with demonstrated efficacy as therapy for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and anaplastic astrocytoma. TMZ has widely replaced the procarbazine, lomustine plus vincristine (PCV) combination for the treatment of malignant brain tumours as a result of its oral administration and favourable toxicity profile. OBJECTIVES: This study had three related aims. First, the cost effectiveness of TMZ (from the Finnish healthcare payer perspective) was compared with PCV in patients with GBM that had relapsed after primary treatment with surgery and radiotherapy. Second, the probability that TMZ is cost effective, compared with PCV, was estimated at different societal willingness-to-pay levels. Third, the value of new information for reducing the uncertainty related to the choice of treatment between TMZ and PCV was evaluated. METHODS: The cost effectiveness of TMZ and PCV was evaluated using a decision-modelling approach. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for cost per gained life-month, progression-free life-month and QALY were calculated. Various information sources were used to acquire parameter values for the model. The efficacy information of both treatments was derived from the medical literature, quality-of-life (QOL) estimates were gathered from Finnish neuro-oncologists using visual analogue scale methods, and data on the use of healthcare resources were collected from hospital databases. The exact prices for resource use were gained from the list of Finnish health service unit costs (year 2001 prices). The model was analysed using second-order Monte Carlo simulation. The value of new information on reducing uncertainty was analysed using the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) approach. RESULTS: According to the derived ICERs, 1 extra life-month gained with TMZ costs euro2367, 1 extra progression-free life-month costs euro2165, and 1 extra QALY costs euro32 471, compared with PCV, in the treatment of GBM. The probability of TMZ being the most cost-effective choice of treatment was >60% for all levels of willingness to pay >euro5000 per gained life-month. The respective probabilities were >75% for all levels of willingness to pay >euro10 000 per gained progression-free life-month and about 85% for all levels of willingness to pay >euro20 000 per gained quality-adjusted life-month. According to EVPI analysis, future research would potentially be cost effective if the costs of research were euro4.1 million (maximum). CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this Finnish analysis, TMZ has a high probability of being more cost effective than PCV for patients with GBM. The addition of QOL aspects to the prolonging of survival increases the probability further.",2005-01-01264,16097842,Pharmacoeconomics,Janne A Martikainen,2005,23 / 8,803-15,Yes,16097842,"Janne A Martikainen; Akseli Kivioja; Taru Hallinen; Pia Vihinen; Economic evaluation of temozolomide in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, Pharmacoeconomics, 2005; 23(8):1179-2027; 803-15",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Second line temozolomide vs. Chemotherapy with procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,32471,Euro,2001,42479.64
2846,The cost-effectiveness of neonatal screening for Cystic Fibrosis: an analysis of alternative scenarios using a decision model,"BACKGROUND: The use of neonatal screening for cystic fibrosis is widely debated in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, but the evidence available to inform policy is limited. This paper explores the cost-effectiveness of adding screening for cystic fibrosis to an existing routine neonatal screening programme for congenital hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria, under alternative scenarios and assumptions. METHODS: The study is based on a decision model comparing screening to no screening in terms of a number of outcome measures, including diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, life-time treatment costs, life years and QALYs gained. The setting is a hypothetical UK health region without an existing neonatal screening programme for cystic fibrosis. RESULTS: Under initial assumptions, neonatal screening (using an immunoreactive trypsin/DNA two stage screening protocol) costs pound5,387 per infant diagnosed, or pound1.83 per infant screened (1998 costs). Neonatal screening for cystic fibrosis produces an incremental cost-effectiveness of pound6,864 per QALY gained, in our base case scenario (an assumed benefit of a 6 month delay in the emergence of symptoms). A difference of 11 months or more in the emergence of symptoms (and mean survival) means neonatal screening is both less costly and produces better outcomes than no screening. CONCLUSION: Neonatal screening is expensive as a method of diagnosis. Neonatal screening may be a cost-effective intervention if the hypothesised delays in the onset of symptoms are confirmed. Implementing both antenatal and neonatal screening would undermine potential economic benefits, since a reduction in the birth incidence of cystic fibrosis would reduce the cost-effectiveness of neonatal screening.",2005-01-01269,16091139,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Neil Simpson,2005,3 /,8,Yes,16091139,"Neil Simpson; Rob Anderson; Franco Sassi; Alexandra Pitman; Peter Lewis; Karen Tu; Heather Lannin; The cost-effectiveness of neonatal screening for Cystic Fibrosis: an analysis of alternative scenarios using a decision model, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2005-Aug-09; 3():1478-7547; 8",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for cystic fibrosis vs. No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,2.00,8041.67,United Kingdom,1998,21161.9
2847,Cost-effectiveness analysis of rituximab combined with chop for treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,"PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness from a French payer perspective of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) alone compared with CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP) for treatment of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. METHODS: Mean patient survival, days of hospitalization, and chemotherapy costs during treatment were estimated from a Phase III trial in France, Belgium, and Switzerland. Survival during the trial was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; survival beyond the trial period was projected based on mortality rates from the Scottish and Newcastle Lymphoma Group database. French diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment schedules were applied to trial data to estimate cost of adverse events and drug administration. We estimated survival and cost-effectiveness [the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained] from 4 years (median clinical trial follow-up period) to 15 years, discounted at a fixed annual rate of 3%. We used published patient preferences. We converted currency to euros, based on 2003 exchange rates. RESULTS: R-CHOP resulted in a 20.6% relative increase in complete response rate (absolute increase from 63% to 76%), and a 31% decrease in risk of death at 4 years (95% CI 8-49%). Over a 15-year time horizon, mean overall survival (OS) duration was estimated to be 6.90 years for R-CHOP and 5.74 years for CHOP, a mean increase in OS of 1.16 years (or 1.07 QALYs). Total direct medical costs were 13,170 euro higher with R-CHOP, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 12,259 euro per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: R-CHOP significantly increases mean OS up to 4 years compared with CHOP, and its cost-effectiveness ratio compares favorably with other oncology treatments in widespread use.",2005-01-01270,16091023,Value Health,Jennie H Best,2005,8 / 4,462-70,Yes,16091023,"Jennie H Best; John Hornberger; Stephen J Proctor; Louis F Omnes; Fred Jost; Cost-effectiveness analysis of rituximab combined with chop for treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Value Health, 2005 Jul-Aug; 8(4):1098-3015; 462-70",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,12259,Euro,2003,19520.39
2848,Cost-utility of 2 maintenance treatments for older adults with depression who responded to a course of electroconvulsive therapy: results from a decision analytic model,"OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) in community-dwelling elderly populations is 1% to 3%. After initial treatment of the acute phase of depression, only about 25% to 30% of elderly patients remain well after 1 to 3 years of follow-up. Previous studies suggested that patients who received maintenance electroconvulsive therapy (MECT) demonstrated lower relapse rates, a better subjective sense of well-being, and lower health care costs at 12-month follow-up. This study provides a cost-utility analysis of 2 maintenance treatments for recurrent depression in elderly patients. METHOD: We used a Markov decision model to compare maintenance pharmacotherapy (MPT) with MECT in a theoretical cohort of elderly individuals with MDD who responded to an initial course of ECT. We estimated total costs and total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for each strategy as well as the cost per QALY. RESULTS: The model produced a cost per patient of dollar 436,102 for MPT and dollar 281,356 for MECT. The MPT strategy yielded 7.55 QALYs and the MECT strategy yielded 11.43 QALYs. Therefore, MPT cost dollar 57,762 per QALY and MECT cost dollar 24,616 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that MECT may be more cost-effective than MPT in the maintenance treatment of older adults with depression who have responded to a course of acute ETC.",2005-01-01272,16086536,Can J Psychiatry,Mohamed Aziz,2005,50 / 7,389-97,No,16086536,"Mohamed Aziz; Ann M Mehringer; Ellen Mozurkewich; Gihan N Razik; Cost-utility of 2 maintenance treatments for older adults with depression who responded to a course of electroconvulsive therapy: results from a decision analytic model, Can J Psychiatry, 2005-Jun; 50(7):0706-7437; 389-97",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pharmacotherapy vs. Electroconvulsive therapy,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-39882.99,United States,2003,-56098.67
2849,Lifetime implications and cost-effectiveness of using finasteride to prevent prostate cancer,"PURPOSE: We estimate the lifetime implications of daily treatment with finasteride following the results of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). In this trial, prostate cancer prevalence was reduced by 25%; however, an increase in the number of high-grade tumors among the treatment group necessitates the long-term projection of the likely benefits and costs. METHODS: We use a Markov decision analysis model with data from the trial, the SEER program, and published literature. The model measures the cost per life-year and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for a cohort of men age 55 years who initiate preventive treatment with finasteride. RESULTS: Finasteride is associated with a gain of 6 life-years per 1000 men treated at an incremental cost of 1660000 dollars per life-year gained. The quality-adjusted analysis results in 46 QALYs gained per 1000 men treated at an incremental cost of 200000 dollars per QALY gained, due primarily to the favorable effects of finasteride on benign prostatic hyperplasia. Under the assumption that the increase in high-grade tumors observed among finasteride treated men is a pathologic artifact, the incremental costs are 290000 dollars per life-year gained and 130000 dollars per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The cost burden associated with finasteride is substantial, while its survival benefit is small and only realized many years after initiating treatment. To achieve an incremental cost below 100000 dollars per QALY gained, the price of finasteride must be reduced by 50% from its current average wholesale price and finasteride must be shown to prevent high-grade as well as low-grade disease.",2005-01-01273,16084177,Am J Med,Steven B Zeliadt,2005,118 / 8,850-7,No,16084177,"Steven B Zeliadt; Ruth D Etzioni; David F Penson; Ian M Thompson; Scott D Ramsey; Lifetime implications and cost-effectiveness of using finasteride to prevent prostate cancer, Am J Med, 2005-Aug; 118(8):0002-9343; 850-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Finasteride prevention therapy vs. No prevention therapy,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,226086.95,United States,2003,318009.73
2850,Using value of information analysis to inform publicly funded research priorities,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this article is to demonstrate the application and feasibility of using value of information analysis to help set priorities for research as part of the UK National Health Service (NHS) Health Technology Assessment Programme. Probabilistic decision analysis and value of information methods were applied to a research topic under consideration by the National Coordinating Centre for Health Technology Assessment (NCCHTA), in the UK. The case study presented considers whether long-term, low-dose antibacterial treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children is effective and cost effective compared with short-term antibacterial therapy. METHODS: A probabilistic decision-analytic model was developed, within which evidence from published sources was synthesised. Eight subgroups were considered and defined in terms of sex and presence of vesico-ureteral reflux (VUR). Costs were assessed from an NHS perspective, and benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Simulation methods were used to determine the probability that alternative therapies would be cost effective at a range of threshold values that the NHS may attach to an additional QALY. Value of information analysis was used to quantify the cost of uncertainty associated with the decision about which therapy to adopt, which indicates the maximum value of future research. The feasibility and practicality of using value of information methods to help inform research prioritisation was evaluated. RESULTS: At a threshold value for an additional QALY of pound30 000, long-term antibacterial treatment may be regarded as cost effective for all eight patient groups. There was, however, substantial uncertainty surrounding the choice of antibacterial. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The use of value of information methods was feasible and could inform research prioritisation for the NHS. In the context of this specific decision faced by the NHS, the results show that long-term low-dose antibacterials for preventing recurrent UTIs may be cost effective, based on current evidence.

2856,Cost-effectiveness of evidence-based pharmacotherapy or cognitive behavior therapy compared with community referral for major depression in predominantly low-income minority women,"BACKGROUND: Few clinical trials have evaluated interventions for major depressive disorder in samples of low-income minority women, and little is known about the cost-effectiveness of depression interventions for this population. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy or cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) compared with community referral for major depression in low-income minority women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted in 267 women with current major depression. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to pharmacotherapy (paroxetine hydrochloride or bupropion hydrochloride) (n = 88), CBT (n = 90), or community referral (n = 89). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcomes were intervention and health care costs, depression-free days, and quality-adjusted life years based on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores and Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey summary scores for 12 months. Cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated to compare incremental patient outcomes with incremental costs for pharmacotherapy relative to community referral and for CBT relative to community referral. RESULTS: Compared with the community referral group, the pharmacotherapy group had significantly lower adjusted mean Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores from the 3rd month through the 10th month (P = .04 to P<.001) of the study, and the CBT group had significantly lower adjusted mean scores from the 5th month through the 10th month (P = .03 to P = .049).

2858,Why modelling a complex intervention is an important precursor to trial design: lessons from studying an intervention to reduce falls-related injuries in older people,"OBJECTIVES: To develop a cost-effectiveness model of a complex intervention from pilot study data in order to inform the viability and design of a subsequent falls prevention trial.METHODS: We used two models; the first estimated the probability of falling over a 12-month period based on a probability tree; the second used Markov simulation to assess the impact of the programme over time.RESULTS: The first model indicated that our intervention would reduce the proportion falling by only 2.8% over a 12-month period. The major reason for this small effect was that less than a quarter of older people at risk of falling were assessed using our screening tool. Even if policy-makers were willing to spend 30,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year gained, there is only a 40% chance that the intervention would be cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses showed that the only scenarios that produced a substantial increase in the effect of the intervention were those in which all older people are assessed.CONCLUSIONS: The model-building approach described in this paper is vital when designing complex trials and where a trial is not possible.

2859,HIV antiretroviral treatment: early versus later,"OBJECTIVES: Cohort studies indicate that starting highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) when the CD4+ T-cell count is less than 200 cells/muL is associated with poor outcomes. These studies have been unable to address how early HAART should be initiated, however. This report uses a modeling approach to compare starting HAART at a mean CD4+ T-cell count greater than 350 cells/microL (early) versus less than 350 cells/microL but greater than 200 cells/microL (later). METHODS: A Markov model tracks people with HIV infection through 6 disease stages defined by CD4+ T-cell count ranges over a 25-year period. Transition probabilities between the disease stages for 6-month periods vary according to initial viral load. Sequences of different first-line, second-line, and ""salvage"" antiretroviral regimens are defined, and their impact on transition probabilities is estimated. HAART effectiveness is based on data from an urban hospital-based HIV clinic, supplemented by clinical trial data. The model computes the incremental cost-effectiveness of alternative treatment patterns and includes sensitivity analyses for a range of plausible alternative input values. RESULTS: Starting HAART earlier rather than later increases total lifetime costs by $19,074, increases years of life by 1.21 years, increases discounted quality-adjusted life-years by 0.61, and has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $31,266 per quality-adjusted life-year. Early therapy is more cost-effective when the impact of HAART on well-being is smaller. CONCLUSIONS: Initiation of HAART at a CD4+ T-cell count greater than 350 cells/microL may be cost-effective (less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year) compared with initiating HAART at a CD4+ T-cell count less than 350 cells/microL but greater than 200 cells/muL and may result in longer quality-adjusted survival.",2005-01-01287,16044008,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Josephine Mauskopf,2005,39 / 5,562-9,No,16044008,"Josephine Mauskopf; Mari Kitahata; Teresa Kauf; Anke Richter; Jerry Tolson; HIV antiretroviral treatment: early versus later, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2005-Aug-15; 39(5):1525-4135; 562-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) begun at CD4 cell count > 350/uL vs. HAART begun at CD4 cell count > 200/uL but < 350/uL,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,31226,United States,2002,44922.91

2861,Decision-analytical model with lifetime estimation of costs and health outcomes for one-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in 65-year-old men,"BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) causes about 2 per cent of all deaths in men over the age of 65 years. A major improvement in operative mortality would have little impact on total mortality, so screening for AAA has been recommended as a solution. The cost-effectiveness of a programme that invited 65-year-old men for ultrasonographic screening was compared with current clinical practice in a decision-analytical model. METHODS: In a probabilistic Markov model, costs and health outcomes of a screening programme and current clinical practice were simulated over a lifetime perspective. To populate the model with the best available evidence, data from published papers, vascular databases and primary research were used. RESULTS: The results of the base-case analysis showed that the incremental cost per gained life-year for a screening programme compared with current practice was 7760, and that for a quality-adjusted life-year was 9700. The probability of screening being cost-effective was high. CONCLUSION: A financially and practically feasible screening programme for AAA, in which men are invited for ultrasonography in the year in which they turn 65, appears to yield positive health outcomes at a reasonable cost.",2005-01-01289,16034844,Br J Surg,M Henriksson,2005,92 / 8,976-83,No,16034844,"M Henriksson; F Lundgren; Decision-analytical model with lifetime estimation of costs and health outcomes for one-time screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in 65-year-old men, Br J Surg, 2005-Aug; 92(8):0007-1323; 976-83",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm vs. No screening,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,9700,Euro,2003,15445.61
2862,Cost-effectiveness of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair,"BACKGROUND: The rapid introduction of endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has considerable implications for the management of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). This study was undertaken to determine an optimal strategy for the use of EVAR based on the best currently available evidence. METHODS: Economic modelling and probabilistic sensitivity analysis considered reference cases representing a fit 70-year-old with a 5.5-cm diameter AAA (RC1) and an 80-year-old with a 6.5-cm AAA unfit for open surgery (RC2). Results were assessed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared with open repair (RC1) or conservative management (RC2). RESULTS: In RC1 EVAR produced a gain of 0.10 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for an estimated cost of 11,449 pound, giving an ICER of 110,000 pound per QALY. EVAR consistently had an ICER above 30,000 pound per QALY over a range of sensitivity analyses and alternative scenarios. In RC2 EVAR produced an estimated benefit of 1.64 QALYs for an incremental cost of 14,077 pound giving an incremental cost per QALY of 8579 pound. CONCLUSION:: It is unlikely that EVAR for fit patients suitable for open repair is within the commonly accepted range of cost-effectiveness for a new technology.

2864,Economic evaluation of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a new treatment for osteoporosis and has been shown to reduce the risks of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women in clinical trials. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of teriparatide in addition to calcium and vitamin D, using a simulation model. The base case analysis was conducted for a cohort of 69-year-old women in Sweden who had at least one previous vertebral fracture and low bone mineral density. The model simulated the course of events in 6-month cycles in individual patients until death or 100 years of age. During each cycle the patients were at risk of experiencing clinical vertebral, hip or wrist fractures, or death. Total accumulated life-time costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated. Swedish data on fracture costs, utility reductions after fracture, fracture risks and mortality rates were used. The model incorporated new epidemiological evidence that indicates fracture risks and mortality rates are higher in the subsequent years post-fracture. The results showed that the cost-effectiveness of the treatment is highly dependant on the risk profile of the treated patients and the timing of starting treatment relative to previous fractures. The cost per QALY gained for treatment of a population of 69-year-olds with a T-score at the femoral neck of -3 was in the base case estimated to be between EUR (<euro>) 20,000 and 64,000 for patients with a recent or historic vertebral fracture respectively.

2866,Cost-effectiveness of full medicare coverage of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for beneficiaries with diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors slow renal disease progression and reduce cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Patients' out-of-pocket costs pose a barrier to using this effective therapy. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness to Medicare of first-dollar coverage (no cost sharing) of ACE inhibitors for beneficiaries with diabetes. DESIGN: Markov model with costs and benefits discounted at 3%. DATA SOURCES: Published literature and Medicare claims data. TARGET POPULATION: 65-year-old Medicare beneficiary with diabetes. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Medicare and societal. INTERVENTIONS: We evaluated Medicare first-dollar coverage of ACE inhibitors compared with current practice (no coverage) and the new Medicare drug benefit. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs (2003 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with current practice, first-dollar coverage of ACE inhibitors saved both lives and money (0.23 QALYs gained and 1606 USD saved per Medicare beneficiary). Compared with the new Medicare drug benefit, first-dollar coverage remained a dominant strategy (0.15 QALYs gained, 922 USD saved). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were most sensitive to our estimate of increase in ACE inhibitor use; however, if ACE inhibitor use increased by only 7.2% (from 40% to 47.2%), first-dollar coverage would remain life-saving at no net cost to Medicare. In analyses conducted from the societal perspective, benefits were similar and cost savings were larger. LIMITATIONS: Results depend on accuracy of the underlying data and assumptions. The effect of more generous drug coverage on medication adherence is uncertain. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare first-dollar coverage of ACE inhibitors for beneficiaries with diabetes appears to extend life and reduce Medicare program costs.

DESIGN: Cost utility analysis using a Markov model, incorporating clinical data from CURE (a multicentre randomised controlled trial, involving 12,562 patients) and data from UK observational studies. SETTING: Health economic evaluation carried out from the perspective of the UK NHS. PATIENTS: A representative cohort of 1000 UK patients aged 66 years, diagnosed with non-ST-segment-elevation ACS. INTERVENTIONS: Either a combination of 75 mg/day clopidogrel (300 mg loading dose, within 24 h prior to hospital admission) and standard therapy (including ASA, 75-325 mg/day) for 1 year followed by standard therapy alone for their remaining lifetime, or standard therapy alone (including ASA, 75-325 mg/day) for life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per life-year gained and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost effectiveness of the clopidogrel combination vs standard therapy alone is estimated as pound6991 per life-year gained and pound7365 per QALY gained. The probability that clopidogrel remains cost effective within the generally accepted pound30,000 per QALY threshold is more than 80%. The confidence interval around the relative risk for vascular death was identified as the main parameter affecting the estimated cost effectiveness.

2868,Gene expression profiling and breast cancer care: what are the potential benefits and policy implications?,"PURPOSE: Gene expression profiling has been proposed as an alternative to clinical guidelines to identify high-risk patients for adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the outcomes associated with gene expression profiling are not clear, and guidelines for the appropriate use of genomic technologies have not been established. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to evaluate the incremental cost and quality-adjusted life years of gene expression profiling versus NIH clinical guidelines in a hypothetical cohort of premenopausal early stage breast cancer patients 44 years of age. We conducted empirical analyses and identified literature-based data to inform the model, and performed probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the results. We interpreted the implications of our findings for treatment guidelines and policies. RESULTS: Use of gene expression profiling resulted in an absolute 5% decrease in the proportion of cases of distant recurrence prevented, 0.21 fewer quality-adjusted life years, and a cost savings of USD 2882. The chosen test cutoff value to identify a tumor as poor prognosis and the cost of adjuvant chemotherapy were the most influential parameters in the analysis, but our findings did not change substantially in sensitivity analyses. Regardless of the test cutoff used to identify a poor prognosis tumor, the gene expression profiling assay studied in our analysis, at its current level of performance, did not attain the threshold sensitivity (95%) necessary to produce equal or greater quality-adjusted life years than NIH guidelines.

2869,Markov model into the cost-utility over five years of etanercept and infliximab compared to usual care in patients with active ankylosing spondylitis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost- utility of etanercept and infliximab compared with usual care in active ankylosing spondylitis. METHODS: A Markov model over five years with cycle times of three months was computed. Patients included had all active disease, defined as Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) (3) 4 and could reach low disease activity defined as BASDAI<4. Non-response to TNF-a inhibitors was always followed by stopping treatment. Response to TNF-a inhibitors could be followed at any time by (1) relapse to BASDAI (3) 4 leading to treatment stop or (2) toxicity leading to treatment stop in case of major toxicity. Probabilities for efficacy, relapse and toxicity were derived from two European RCTs. Utilities and costs assigned to the BASDAI- disease states were derived from a two years' observational Dutch cohort. In sensitivity analyses probabilities of effectiveness, toxicity, costs and utilities were varied. RESULTS: Over five years the total Quality Adjusted Life Years varied between 2.57 to 2.89 for usual care compared with 3.13 to 3.42 and 3.07 to 3.35 for etanercept or infliximab. Cumulative costs were between 49,555 to 69,982 for usual care compared with 59,574 to 91,183 or 28,3330 to 106,775 for etanercept and infliximab.

2871,The cost-effectiveness of biomarkers for predicting the development of oesophageal adenocarcinoma,"BACKGROUND: The recommended surveillance strategy for oesophageal adenocarcinoma may prevent as few as 50% of cancer deaths. Tissue biomarkers have been proposed to identify high-risk patients. AIM: To determine performance characteristics of an ideal biomarker, or panel of biomarkers, that would make its use more cost-effective than the current surveillance strategy. METHODS: We created a Markov model using data from published literature, and performed a cost-utility analysis. The population consisted of 50-year-old Caucasian men with gastro-oesophageal reflux, who were monitored until age 80. We examined strategies of observation only, current practice (dysplasia-guided surveillance), surveillance every 3 months for patients with a positive biomarker (biomarker-guided surveillance), and oesophagectomy immediately for a positive biomarker (biomarker-guided oesophagectomy). The primary outcome was the threshold cost and performance characteristics needed for a biomarker to be more cost-effective than current practice. RESULTS: Regardless of the cost, the biomarker needs to be at least 95% specific for biomarker-guided oesophagectomy to be cost-effective. For biomarker-guided surveillance to be cost-effective, a $100 biomarker could be 80% sensitive and specific.

2875,The cost-effectiveness of combined androgen blockade with bicalutamide and luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist in men with metastatic prostate cancer,"PURPOSE: Combined androgen blockade therapy (CAB) has been shown to have a small survival advantage over luteinizing hormone releasing hormone LH-RH agonists (LH-RHa) alone in men with metastatic prostate cancer. The goal of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of CAB with bicalutamide and LH-RH agonist therapy to LH-RH agonist therapy alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A macro-simulation model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of 2 interventions for stage D2 prostate cancer, 1) CAB with bicalutamide 50 mg per day and monthly dosing of an LH-RHa or 2) monthly LH-RH agonist therapy. Cost and outcomes are tabulated in 5 and 10-year time horizons. Model assumptions were taken from the published literature. Appropriate 1-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: At 5 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CAB, when compared with LH-RHa monotherapy, was US dollars 33,677 per quality-adjusted life-year. In other words, for every additional quality-adjusted life year that a patient lived because he received CAB, it cost US dollars 33,677. At 10 years the ICER for CAB was US dollars 20,053 (well within the accepted cost-effectiveness threshold). If quality adjustment was not included, the ICER for CAB was even more favorable (US dollars 20,489 at 5 years and US dollars 13,313 at 10 years). The model was most sensitive to the estimates of effectiveness (survival) of LH-RHa therapy alone and CAB therapy. The model was also fairly sensitive to the quality of life effect of having late stage prostate cancer and the cost of bicalutamide.

METHODS: Intent-to-treat analysis of data from a group-level controlled trial, in which matched primary care clinics in the US were randomized to usual care or to one of two interventions designed to increase the rate of effective depression treatment. One intervention facilitated medication management (""QI-Meds"") and the other psychotherapy (""QI-Therapy""), but patients and clinicians could choose the type of treatment, or none. The study involved 46 clinics in 6 non-academic, managed care organizations; 181 primary care providers; and 375 male and 981 female patients with current depression.

2880,Cost-effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (Stalevo) compared to standard care in UK Parkinson's disease patients with wearing-off,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (LCE;Stalevo), in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and end-of-dose motor fluctuations (wearing-off). LCE, with or without other antiparkinsonian medications, was compared to UK standard care, comprising traditional levodopa/ dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) with other antiparkinsonian medications (e.g. selegiline or dopamine agonists) added as needed. The costs and outcomes of both treatments were projected over a period of 10 years from the perspective (a) of society as a whole and (b) of the UK National Health Service (NHS). Sensitivity analyses, including second-order Monte Carlo simulations, were performed to assess the confidence level of the primary results. RESULTS: Treatment with LCE produced an average gain of +1.04 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient (2.57 vs. 1.53) in the base-case analysis (discount rate 3.5%). This gain was accompanied by a reduction in the total 10-year direct cost of care to society of 10198 pounds per patient ( approximately E14800). From the societal perspective, therefore, LCE was dominant, producing better clinical outcomes with lower costs. This dominance was reiterated in all sensitivity analyses of society-focused analysis, including a shortening of the time-frame to 5 years.Although treatment with LCE resulted in an increase in direct costs per patient of 3239 pounds (25756 pounds versus 22517 pounds) to the NHS over the 10-year period analysed, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of LCE was only 3105 pounds per QALY gained (approximately E4500). All ICERs to the NHS remained below 3800 pounds per QALY gained in univariate sensitivity analyses applying different discount rates. When a shorter, 5-year, time-horizon was analysed, the NHS-related ICER for LCE was 6526 pounds per QALY gained. All these ICERs are within the range usually considered to indicate acceptable or highly acceptable cost effectiveness (defined as < 30000 pounds per QALY gained).The results of the Monte Carlo simulations indicated that the likelihood of LCE being either 'dominant' or more effective at an 'acceptable cost' from either the societal or the NHS perspective was high, exceeding 96% in the base-case sensitivity analysis, and was 93% even when all the uncertainties associated with the model were taken into consideration simultaneously. In particular, compared to standard care, the probability that LCE would provide better outcomes at a lower cost to society as a whole was 77% in the base-case sensitivity analysis and 72% in the scenario involving the highest degree of uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: In the UK the use of LCE to treat PD patients with wearing-off is beneficial to individual patients and likely to offer money savings to society as a whole, compared with UK standard therapy. The added cost of the medication itself is exceeded by the savings made in other direct costs of PD, mainly those relating to social care or PD-related private expenditures.",2005-01-01306,16004667,Curr Med Res Opin,Leslie J Findley,2005,21 / 7,1005-14,No,16004667,"Leslie J Findley; Andrew Lees; Marjo Apajasalo; Anna Pitkänen; Heidi Turunen; Cost-effectiveness of levodopa/carbidopa/entacapone (Stalevo) compared to standard care in UK Parkinson's disease patients with wearing-off, Curr Med Res Opin, 2005-Jul; 21(7):0300-7995; 1005-14",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Levodopa/ carbidopa/ entacapone (Stalevo) vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,-7273.89,United Kingdom,2003,-16724.7
2881,One size fits some: the impact of patient treatment attitudes on the cost-effectiveness of a depression primary-care intervention,"BACKGROUND: Despite their impact on outcomes, the effect of patient treatment attitudes on the cost-effectiveness of health-care interventions is not widely studied. This study estimated the impact of patient receptivity to antidepressant medication on the cost-effectiveness of an evidence-based primary-care depression intervention. METHOD: Twelve community primary-care practices were stratified and then randomized to enhanced (intervention) or usual care. Subjects included 211 patients beginning a new treatment episode for major depression. At baseline, 111 (52.6%) and 145 (68.7%) reported receptivity to antidepressant medication and counseling respectively. The intervention trained the primary-care teams to assess, educate, and monitor depressed patients. Twelve-month incremental (enhanced minus usual care) total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated. RESULTS: Among patients receptive to antidepressants, the mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was dollar 5,864 per QALY (sensitivity analyses up to dollar 14,689 per QALY). For patients not receptive to antidepressants, the mean incremental QALY score was negative (for both main and sensitivity analyses), or the intervention was at least no more effective than usual care. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a re-thinking of the 'one size fits all' depression intervention, given that half of depressed primary-care patients may be non-receptive to antidepressant medication treatment.

2883,Cost-effectiveness of a community-level HIV risk reduction intervention for women living in low-income housing developments,"We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of a multi-site community-level HIV prevention trial that enrolled women living in 18 low-income housing developments in 5 U.S. cities. A mathematical model of HIV transmission was used to estimate the number of HIV infections averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved by the community-level intervention, based on data obtained from community-wide sexual behavior surveys at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Results indicated that the intervention prevented approximately 1 infection per 3500 women reached by the intervention, at a total cost of 174,845 dollars. The cost per QALY saved by the intervention was 37,433 dollars and the cost per HIV infection averted was 732,072 dollars. The community-level intervention was moderately cost-effective in comparison with other HIV prevention programs for at-risk women. Synergistic approaches to HIV prevention that combine community-level sexual norm change interventions with more intensive risk reduction programs for high-risk women are needed. EDITORS' STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS: The authors present a promising and efficient community-level HIV prevention approach, with effects beyond the limited scope of individual or small group interventions.

2884,Cost-effectiveness of interferon {alpha} or peginterferon {alpha} with ribavirin for histologically mild chronic hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND: For patients with mild chronic hepatitis C the cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy is unknown. AIMS: To assess whether anti-viral therapy (either interferon alpha or peginterferon alpha combined with ribavirin) is cost-effective at a mild stage compared to waiting and only treating those cases who progress to moderate disease. PATIENTS: Cases with mild chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model estimates long- term costs and outcomes for patients with mild chronic hepatitis C. The model uses effectiveness and cost data from the UK mild hepatitis C RCT, combined with estimates of disease progression and cost from observational studies. RESULTS: For patients with genotype non-1 antiviral treatment at a mild rather than a moderate stage improved outcomes measured by Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained. The mean cost per QALY gained from antiviral treatment with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin, compared to no treatment, was pound5,285 ($8,284). For these patients treatment at a mild stage with peginterferon alpha-2b and ribavirin rather than interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin, led to further additional QALYS; the average cost per QALY gained was pound21,155 ($33,158). For patients with genotype 1, interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin treatment for mild disease only led to a sustained virological response (SVR) for 18% of cases and was not cost-effective.

2886,Cost-effectiveness analysis of rizatriptan and sumatriptan versus Cafergot in the acute treatment of migraine,"BACKGROUND: Both ergotamine and selective serotonin 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists ('triptans') are currently used in the treatment of moderate to severe migraine. Ergotamine is a traditional therapy with a lower drug acquisition cost compared with triptans. It has been shown that triptans are more efficacious than ergotamine, but the higher acquisition costs and shorter duration of action are disadvantages of triptans compared with ergotamine. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to provide a comparison of the cost-effectiveness of rizatriptan 10 mg and sumatriptan 50 mg tablets with that of a fixed-dose combination of ergotamine tartrate plus caffeine (Cafergot) in the treatment of an acute migraine attack. The cost-effectiveness of rizatriptan in comparison with sumatriptan was also assessed. METHODS: Three separate decision tree models were developed (model 1: rizatriptan vs Cafergot; model 2: sumatriptan vs Cafergot; model 3: rizatriptan vs sumatriptan). The time horizon was 1 year. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the societal perspective using cost and effectiveness estimates from the literature. All costs were converted to US dollars (2003). The cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Base case evaluation showed that both rizatriptan and sumatriptan dominated Cafergot. The net annual saving associated with use of rizatriptan was US dollars 622.98 per patient, with an incremental QALY of 0.001. Use of sumatriptan resulted in a saving of US dollars 620.90 and an increase in QALY. The cost-effective ratios were not sensitive to changes in key variables such as efficacy, utility, drug costs, hospitalisation cost and patient preference over alternative therapies. The study further showed that rizatriptan is more cost effective than sumatriptan, as evidenced by its lower cost and greater effectiveness. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to moderate changes in drug efficacy. CONCLUSION: Rizatriptan and sumatriptan were less costly and more effective than Cafergot in the treatment of an acute migraine attack. Rizatriptan was somewhat less costly and more effective than sumatriptan.

2889,Cost-effectiveness of enfuvirtide for treatment-experienced patients with HIV in Italy,"BACKGROUND: Enfuvirtide (ENF) plus an optimized background (OB) antiretroviral regimen delays virological failure (VF), reduces HIV-1 viral load, and increases CD4 count compared with OB only in pretreated patients. PURPOSE: To forecast long-term outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of ENF+OB vs. OB in the Italian health care system. METHOD: A Markov model was developed and clinical trial results on viral suppression and CD4 count were linked with data from HAART-era studies of the risk of AIDS-defining events (ADEs) and death. Resource data were obtained from Italian sources on direct medical costs. Cost-effectiveness was computed as the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. RESULTS: Patients receiving ENF+OB were projected to experience a mean time to virological failure of 1.0 years vs. 0.5 years for OB and mean time to immunological failure of 3.1 years vs. 1.3 years for OB. Life expectancy and QALYs were greater for ENF+OB than OB by 1.8 and 1.5 years, respectively. Total lifetime medical cost was euro 126,487 for ENF+OB and euro 84,416 for OB, a difference of euro 42,071 due to the cost of ENF itself (euro 18,400) and the medical costs associated with additional life expectancy (euro 23,671). The incremental cost-effectiveness of ENF+OB was euro 23,721 per life year (euro 28,669 per QALY).

2890,The cost effectiveness of gonorrhea screening in urban emergency departments,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of gonorrhea (GC) among adolescent and young women attending some urban emergency departments (EDs) ranges from 1% to 7%, but historically screening has not been logistically practical. GOAL: The primary goal of the study was to assess the cost effectiveness of GC screening in women ages 15 to 29, seeking care in urban EDs, using noninvasive or rapid point-of-care tests. STUDY: We developed a state-transition Markov model to compare the net lifetime health consequences, costs, and cost effectiveness of routine ED care (no screening for women without genitourinary symptoms) to GC screening using 1 of 5 detection methods: Gram-stained smears of endocervical swab specimens, urine-based nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), NAATs performed on endocervical swabs, rapid immunochromotographic strip test (RIS) performed on clinician-collected vaginal swabs, and RIS on patient-collected vaginal swabs. RESULTS: Screening women between 15 and 29 years of age using urine-based NAATs prevented 1247 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and saved 177 US dollars per patient compared with no screening. Compared with urine-based NAAT, screening with RIS using clinician-obtained vaginal swabs prevented an additional 220 cases of PID and had an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of 6490 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Results were sensitive to assumptions about loss to follow-up, gonorrhea prevalence, and test costs.

2895,Cost-effectiveness analysis of prenatal population-based fragile X carrier screening,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a widespread prenatal population-based fragile X carrier screening program. STUDY DESIGN: A decision tree was designed comparing screening versus not screening for the fragile X mental retardation protein 1 premutation in all pregnant women. Baseline values included a prevalence of fragile X mental retardation protein 1 premutations of 3.3 per 1000, a premutation expansion rate of 11.3%, and a 99% sensitivity of the screening test. The cost of the screening test was varied from 75 US dollars to 300 US dollars. A sensitivity analysis of the probabilities, utilities, and costs was performed. RESULTS: The screening strategy would lead to the identification of 80% of the fetuses affected by fragile X annually. Assuming the cost of 95 US dollars per test and only one child, the program would be cost effective at 14,858 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. The screening strategy remained cost effective up to 140 US dollars per test and 1 child per woman or for 2 children per woman up to a cost of 281 US dollars per test. CONCLUSION: Population-based screening for the fragile X premutation may be both clinically desirable and cost effective. Prospective pilot studies of this screening modality are needed in the prenatal setting.",2005-01-01323,15970847,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Thomas J Musci,2005,192 / 6,1905-12; discussion 1912-5,No,15970847,"Thomas J Musci; Aaron B Caughey; Cost-effectiveness analysis of prenatal population-based fragile X carrier screening, Am J Obstet Gynecol, 2005-Jun; 192(6):0002-9378; 1905-12; discussion 1912-5",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fragile X carrier screening vs. No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,14858,United States,2004,20356.88

2899,Implications of spillover effects within the family for medical cost-effectiveness analysis,"Medical cost-effectiveness analyses traditionally treat patients as isolated individuals and neglect the effects of improvement in patients' health on the welfare of their family members. We use a model based on a family utility function with altruistic linkages to show that there can be direct and indirect effects on the welfare of all family members. We focus specially on a model of how the spillover effects to the spouse in a two-person family might affect choice of treatments for prostate cancer. We then test the predictions of this model by analyzing treatment choices of prostate cancer patients using the linked SEER-Medicare database. We find that our results are consistent with the model's predictions. We conclude that cost-effectiveness analyses may better reflect the full costs and benefits of medical interventions if they incorporate these family effects. However, concerns about equity present a dilemma for the practice of CEA from the societal perspective.",2005-01-01328,15960995,J Health Econ,Anirban Basu,2005,24 / 4,751-73,No,15960995,"Anirban Basu; David Meltzer; Implications of spillover effects within the family for medical cost-effectiveness analysis, J Health Econ, 2005-Jul; 24(4):0167-6296; 751-73",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surgery vs. Watchful waiting,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,49 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-34900,United States,1993,-62508.68
