2201,Cost effectiveness of peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin versus interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin for initial treatment of chronic hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND: Peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin therapy in previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C yields the highest sustained virological response rates of any treatment strategy but is expensive. AIMS: To estimate the cost effectiveness of treatment with peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin compared with interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin for initial treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: Individual patient level data from a randomised clinical trial with peginterferon plus ribavirin were applied to a previously published and validated Markov model to project lifelong clinical outcomes. Quality of life and economic estimates were based on German patient data. We used a societal perspective and applied a 3% annual discount rate. RESULTS: Compared with no antiviral therapy, peginterferon plus fixed or weight based dosing of ribavirin increased life expectancy by 4.2 and 4.7 years, respectively. Compared with standard interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin, peginterferon plus fixed or weight based dosing of ribavirin increased life expectancy by 0.5 and by 1.0 years with incremental cost effectiveness ratios of 11,800 euros and 6600 euros per quality adjusted life year (QALY), respectively. Subgroup analyses by genotype, viral load, sex, and histology showed that peginterferon plus weight based ribavirin remained cost effective compared with other well accepted medical treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin should reduce the incidence of liver complications, prolong life, improve quality of life, and be cost effective for the initial treatment of chronic hepatitis C.",2003-01-00787,12584228,Gut,U Siebert,2003,52 / 3,425-32,No,12584228,"U Siebert; G Sroczynski; S Rossol; Jürgen Wasem; U Ravens-Sieberer; B M Kurth; Michael P Manns; John G McHutchison; John B.

2202,A cost-utility analysis of patients undergoing orthognathic treatment for the management of dentofacial disharmony,"INTRODUCTION: Management of dentofacial discrepancies using orthognathic treatment is now a common procedure in the United Kingdom. Although the benefits of orthognathic intervention are often considered, the cost implications have not been investigated to our knowledge. This study is a cost-utility analysis of orthognathic treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients were interviewed five times during treatment using the time trade-off (TTO) method to establish utility values. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained as a result of treatment were calculated and discounted. The resource use was calculated for each of the 21 patients individually and the costs subjected to both a sensitivity analysis and discounting. The incremental mean cost per additional QALY was calculated (as compared with a ""no treatment"" approach). RESULTS: The incremental cost for each additional QALY was 561 pounds sterling for the groups combined, based on mean additional costs and QALYs (546 pounds sterling for the bimaxillary group and 617 pounds sterling for the single jaw group). DISCUSSION: Orthognathic treatment seems to provide good outcomes at relatively low cost. Even allowing for the uncertainty in mean costs and QALYs, there is a high probability of treatment being cost-effective. Cost-utility analysis is still a relatively new technique in dentistry and further studies should be encouraged.",2003-01-00792,12576038,Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,S J Cunningham,2003,41 / 1,32-5,No,12576038,"S J Cunningham; Mark Sculpher; F Sassi; A Manca; A cost-utility analysis of patients undergoing orthognathic treatment for the management of dentofacial disharmony, Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg, 2003-Feb; 41(1):0266-4356; 32-5",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Orthodontic treatment and surgery vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,2.00,561,United Kingdom,2001,1180.28
2203,Cost-effectiveness analysis of augmentation therapy for severe alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency,"A Markov-based decision model was created to assess the cost-effectiveness of augmentation therapy (Aug) for severe alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, comparing strategies of: (1) no Aug, (2) Aug for life, and (3) Aug until FEV1 is below 35% predicted. A hypothetical cohort of 46-year-old patients with FEV1 49% predicted was followed over time using Monte Carlo simulation across five possible health states: (1) FEV1 50 to 79% predicted, (2) FEV1 35 to 49% predicted, (3) FEV1 below 35% predicted, (4) status-post-lung transplantation, and (5) dead. Treatment for life yielded 7.19 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost 895,243 dollars. Treating until FEV1 is below 35% predicted cost 511,930 dollars and produced 6.64 QALYs. ""No Aug"" cost 92,091 dollars with 4.62 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 207,841 dollars/QALY for Aug until FEV1 is below 35% predicted and 312,511 dollars/QALY for the ""Aug for life"" strategy. In all sensitivity analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for Aug for life exceeded 100,000 dollars. The cost of Aug needed to be reduced from 54,765 dollars to 4,900 dollars for the ""Aug for life"" strategy to be considered cost-effective.

2205,Single- versus multiple-fraction radiotherapy in patients with painful bone metastases: cost-utility analysis based on a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy is an effective palliative treatment for cancer patients with painful bone metastases. Although single- and multiple-fraction radiotherapy are thought to provide equal palliation, which treatment schedule provides better value for the money is unknown. We compared quality-adjusted life expectancy (the overall valuation of the health of the patients) and societal costs for patients receiving either single- or multiple-fraction radiotherapy. METHODS: A societal cost-utility analysis was performed on a Dutch randomized, controlled trial of 1157 patients with painful bone metastases that compared pain responses and quality of life from a single-fraction treatment schedule of 8 Gy with a treatment schedule of six fractions of 4 Gy each. The societal values of life expectancies were assessed with the EuroQol classification system (EQ-5D) questionnaire. A subset of 166 patients also answered additional questionnaires to estimate nonradiotherapy and nonmedical costs. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Comparing the single- and multiple-fraction radiotherapy schedules, no differences were found in life expectancy (43.0 versus 40.4 weeks, P =.20) or quality-adjusted life expectancy (17.7 versus 16.0 weeks, P =.21). The estimated cost of radiotherapy, including retreatments and nonmedical costs, was statistically significantly lower for the single-fraction schedule than for the multiple-fraction schedule ($2438 versus $3311, difference = $873, 95% confidence interval [CI] on the difference = $449 to $1297; P<.001). The estimated difference in total societal costs was larger, also in favor of the single-fraction schedule, but it was not statistically significant ($4700 versus $6453, difference = $1753, 95% CI on the difference = -$99 to $3604; P =.06). For willingness-to-pay between $5000 and $40 000 per quality-adjusted life year, the single-fraction schedule was statistically significantly more cost-effective than the multiple-fraction schedule (P< or =.05). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with multiple-fraction radiotherapy, single-fraction radiotherapy provides equal palliation and quality of life and has lower medical and societal costs, at least in The Netherlands. Therefore, single-fraction radiotherapy should be considered as the palliative treatment of choice for cancer patients with painful bone metastases.",2003-01-00795,12569144,J Natl Cancer Inst,Wilbert B van den Hout,2003,95 / 3,222-9,No,12569144,"Wilbert B van den Hout; Yvette M van der Linden; Elsbeth Steenland; Ruud G J Wiggenraad; J Kievit; Hanneke de Haes; Jan Willem H Leer; Single- versus multiple-fraction radiotherapy in patients with painful bone metastases: cost-utility analysis based on a randomized trial, J Natl Cancer Inst, 2003-Feb-05; 95(3):0027-8874; 222-9",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Single-fraction radiotherapy vs. Multiple-fraction radiotherapy (6 fractions of 4 Gy),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-53121.21,United States,2002,-76422.2
2206,Is carotid angioplasty and stenting more cost effective than carotid endarterectomy?,"OBJECTIVE: Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) has been advocated as a minimally invasive and inexpensive alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, a precise comparative analysis of the immediate and long-term costs associated with these two procedures has not been performed. To accomplish this, a Markov decision analysis model was created to evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of these two interventions. METHODS: Procedural morbidity/mortality rate for CEA and costs (not charges) were derived from a retrospective review of consecutive patients treated at New York Presbyterian Hospital/Cornell (n = 447). Data for CAS were obtained from the literature. We incorporated into this model both the immediate procedural costs and the long-term cost of morbidities, such as stroke (major stroke in the first year = $52,019; in subsequent years = $27,336/y; minor stroke = $9419). We determined long-term survival rate in quality-adjusted life years and lifetime costs for a hypothetic cohort of 70-year-old patients undergoing either CEA or CAS. Our measure of outcome was the cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The immediate procedural costs of CEA and CAS were $7871 and $10,133 respectively. We assumed major plus minor stroke rates for CEA and CAS of 0.9% and 5%, respectively. We assumed a 30-day mortality rate of 0% for CEA and 1.2% for CAS. In our base case analysis, CEA was cost saving (lifetime savings = $7017/patient; increase in quality-adjusted life years saved = 0.16). Sensitivity analysis revealed major stroke and death rates as the major contributors to this differential in cost effectiveness. Procedural costs were less important, and minor stroke rates were least important. CAS became cost effective only if its major stroke and mortality rates were made equivalent to those of CEA. CONCLUSION: CEA is cost saving compared with CAS. This is related to the higher rate of stroke with CAS and the high cost of stents and protection devices. To be economically competitive, the mortality and major stroke rates of CAS must be at least equivalent if not less than those of CEA.",2003-01-00799,12563203,J Vasc Surg,Sashi Kilaru,2003,37 / 2,331-9,No,12563203,"Sashi Kilaru; Peter Korn; Karthikeshwar Kasirajan; Thomas Y Lee; Frederick P Beavers; Ross T Lyon; Harry L Bush; K Craig Kent; Is carotid angioplasty and stenting more cost effective than carotid endarterectomy?, J Vasc Surg, 2003-Feb; 37(2):0741-5214; 331-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) vs. Carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS),Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-43856.25,United States,1997,-70719.5
2207,Health and economic impact of posttransfusion hepatitis B and cost-effectiveness analysis of expanded HBV testing protocols of blood donors: a study focused on the European Union,"BACKGROUND: Residual risk of posttransfusion hepatitis B (PT-HB) may be reduced through implementation of HBV NAT or the new, enhanced-sensitivity HBsAg assays in routine donor testing. However, there are some doubts about the cost-effectiveness of these new safety measures, because hepatitis B acquired in adulthood is not regarded as a severe disease in western countries. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A computer model was designed to estimate the health outcomes and associated costs of patients with PT-HB. Results from this model and estimations of the residual risk of HBV transmission, the risk reduction yielded by the new assays, and their cost were used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of including the new HBsAg assays or single-sample HBV NAT in the routine screening of blood donors. RESULTS: The model predicts that 0.97 percent of patients with PT-HB die of liver disease (54% of them due to fulminant hepatitis). The mean loss of life expectancy was 0.178 years per patient, and the present value of the lifetime costs of treating PT-HB was 4160 euros per patient. Single-donor HBV NAT or the new HBsAg assays would increase the life expectancy of blood recipients by 16 (95% CI, 8-40) or 14 (95% CI, 7-28) years, respectively, per every 10 million donations tested. The projected cost per life-year gained was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.15-1.85) million euros for the enhanced-sensitivity HBsAg assays and 5.8 (95% CI, 1.9-13.1) million euros for single-donation HBV NAT, both compared with current HBsAg assays. If single-donation HBV NAT is compared with the new HBsAg assays, its cost- effectiveness ratio increases to 53 (95% CI, 16-127) million euros.

2214,A comparison of on-pump and off-pump coronary bypass surgery in low-risk patients,"BACKGROUND: The performance of coronary bypass surgery without cardiopulmonary bypass (""off pump"") may reduce perioperative morbidity and costs, but it is uncertain whether the outcome is similar to that involving the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (""on pump""). METHODS: In a multicenter, randomized trial, we randomly assigned 139 patients with predominantly single- or double-vessel coronary disease to on-pump surgery and 142 to off-pump surgery. Cardiac outcome and cost effectiveness were determined one year after surgery. The uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness ratio (cost differences per quality-adjusted year of life gained) was addressed by bootstrapping. RESULTS: At one year, the rate of freedom from death, stroke, myocardial infarction, and coronary reintervention was 90.6 percent after on-pump surgery and 88.0 percent after off-pump surgery (absolute difference, 2.6 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, - 4.6 to 9.8). Graft patency in a randomized subgroup of patients was 93 percent after on-pump surgery and 91 percent after off-pump surgery (absolute difference, 2.0 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, - 6.5 to 10.4). On-pump surgery was associated with $1,839 in additional direct costs per patient ($14,908 vs. $13,069--a difference of 14.1 percent) and an increase in quality-adjusted years of life of 0.83 as compared with 0.82 (difference, 0.01 year; 95 percent confidence interval, - 0.03 to 0.04). Off-pump surgery was more cost effective than on-pump surgery in 95 percent of bootstrap estimates. CONCLUSIONS: In low-risk patients, there was no difference in cardiac outcome at one year between those who underwent on-pump bypass surgery and those who underwent off-pump surgery.

2215,Which antimicrobial impregnated central venous catheter should we use? Modeling the costs and outcomes of antimicrobial catheter use,"BACKGROUND: Catheter-related bloodstream infections are costly and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Trials suggest that central venous catheters impregnated with minocycline/rifampin, although more expensive, are clinically superior to chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine impregnated catheters. It remains unclear whether minocycline/rifampin catheters are cost-effective for all high-risk patients or only those requiring longer-term catheterization. METHODS: We developed a series of decision models with patient-level clinical trial data to determine whether minocycline/rifampin catheters are cost-effective for patients requiring various durations of catheterization. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for patients catheterized for durations ranging from 1 to 25 days. RESULTS: The data were too sparse to estimate cost-effectiveness for patients catheterized less than 8 days. The probability that minocycline/rifampin catheters were cost-effective compared with chlorhexidine/silver sulfadiazine catheters in patients catheterized for 8 days was 91%. The probability that the minocycline/rifampin catheters in patients catheterized 13 days or longer resulted in cost savings was more than 95%.

2218,Assessment of cost-effectiveness of universal hepatitis B immunization in a low-income country with intermediate endemicity using a Markov model,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Most countries with high hepatitis B (HB) virus endemicity and most high-income countries have introduced immunization programmes against this infection. However, several low-income countries with intermediate HB endemicity have not done so. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of universal childhood HB immunization in such countries using India as an example, since available data on this aspect are limited. METHODS: Marginal cost of every life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with universal HB vaccination was calculated using a Markov model. Two types of analyses (including and excluding expenditure on treatment of long-term complications of HB infection) were done. Several sensitivity analyses and Monte-Carlo simulation were performed. RESULTS: Universal immunization reduced the HB carrier rate by 71%, and increased the number of years and QALY lived by a birth-cohort by 0.173 years (61.072 vs. 60.899 years) and 0.213 years (61.056 vs. 60.843 years), respectively. Marginal costs were US$16.27 per life-year gained and US$13.22 per QALY gained, much lower than annual per capita income. One-way sensitivity analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation confirmed the robustness of the conclusions.

2219,Cost-effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa (activated) in the treatment of severe sepsis,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa (activated) therapy, which was recently shown to reduce mortality in severe sepsis. DESIGN: Estimates of effectiveness and resource use were based on data collected prospectively as part of a multicenter international trial. Estimates of hospital costs were based on a subset of the patients treated in the United States (33% of all enrolled patients). Lifetime projections were modeled from published sources and tested in sensitivity analyses. Analyses were conducted from the United States societal perspective, limited to healthcare costs, and using a 3% annual discount rate. SETTING: A total of 164 medical institutions in 11 countries. PATIENTS: Adults > or = 18 yrs of age with severe sepsis INTERVENTIONS: Eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive a 96-hr intravenous infusion of drotrecogin alfa (activated) at 24 microg/kg/hr (n = 850) or placebo (n = 840). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Base Case: incremental short-term (days 1-28) healthcare costs per day-28 survivor; Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine Reference Case: incremental lifetime healthcare costs per quality-adjusted life-year. Over the first 28 days (short-term Base Case), drotrecogin alfa (activated) increased the costs of care by $9,800 and survival by 0.061 lives saved per treated patient. Thus, drotrecogin alfa (activated) cost $160,000 per life saved (with 84.7% probability that ratio is <$250,000 per life saved). Projected to lifetime (lifetime Reference Case), drotrecogin alfa (activated) increased the costs of care by $16,000 and quality-adjusted survival by 0.33 quality-adjusted life-years per treated patient. Thus, drotrecogin alfa (activated) cost $48,800 per quality-adjusted life-year (with 82% probability that ratio is <$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year). Estimates were generally robust to sensitivity analyses, although cost-effectiveness deteriorated to >$100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year if survivors lived <4.6 yrs on average. Drotrecogin alfa (activated) cost $27,400 per quality-adjusted life-year when limited to patients with an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score > or = 25 and was cost-ineffective when limited to patients with a score <25.

Providing high-quality retinal screening is difficult, especially in rural and remote areas. Canada""s First Nations population has a higher prevalence of diabetes and is, in general, more geographically isolated than the broader Canadian population. We modelled the cost-effectiveness of retinopathy screening by travelling retina specialists versus retinal photography with a portable digital camera in an isolated First Nations cohort with diabetes. METHODS: The 2 screening programs were modelled to run concurrently for 5 years, with outcomes evaluated over 10 years. To construct economic models for the population of Cree individuals living in the western James Bay area of northern Ontario, we used available data on the prevalence of diabetes in the area and estimates of the incidence of retinopathy derived from the published literature. We compared the screening models and calculated total costs, visual outcome, costs per sight-year saved and costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We also estimated the costs of implementing a screening program for all First Nations individuals in Ontario with diabetes and no access to an ophthalmologist. RESULTS: From the perspective of the health care system the camera program was preferable to the specialist-based program. Over 10 years, 67 v. 56 sight years were saved, compared with no screening, at costs of 3900 Canadian dollars v. 9800 Canadian dollars per sight year and 15,000 Canadian dollars v. 37,000 Canadian dollars per QALY.

2222,Cost-effectiveness of a potential vaccine for human papillomavirus,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, usually a sexually transmitted disease, is a risk factor for cervical cancer. Given the substantial disease and death associated with HPV and cervical cancer, development of a prophylactic HPV vaccine is a public health priority. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating adolescent girls for high-risk HPV infections relative to current practice. A vaccine with a 75% probability of immunity against high-risk HPV infection resulted in a life-expectancy gain of 2.8 days or 4.0 quality-adjusted life days at a cost of $246 relative to current practice (incremental cost effectiveness of $22,755/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). If all 12-year-old girls currently living in the United States were vaccinated, >1,300 deaths from cervical cancer would be averted during their lifetimes. Vaccination of girls against high-risk HPV is relatively cost effective even when vaccine efficacy is low. If the vaccine efficacy rate is 35%, the cost effectiveness increases to $52,398/QALY.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic model that considered test characteristics such as sensitivity, complications induced by the test, implications of missing lesions, and the consequences of overtreating patients, was developed to evaluate the societal cost-effectiveness (CE) of magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, duplex ultrasonography (US), and DSA. Our main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs (in dollars), and incremental CE ratios. The base-case analysis considered a cohort of 60-year old male patients without a history of coronary artery disease who presented with severe claudication to undergo pretreatment imaging workup. RESULTS: The range in effectiveness and lifetime costs among different diagnostic workup strategies was small (largest difference in effectiveness: 0.025 QALYs; largest difference in lifetime costs: $1,800). If treatment was limited to angioplasty in patients with suitable lesions, MR angiography had an incremental CE ratio of $35,000 per QALY compared with no diagnostic workup, and DSA had an incremental CE ratio of $471,000 per QALY compared with MR angiography. If treatment options included both angioplasty and bypass surgery, DSA had an incremental CE ratio of $179,000 per QALY compared with no diagnostic workup, and MR angiography and duplex US were less effective and more costly.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic model that considered test characteristics such as sensitivity, complications induced by the test, implications of missing lesions, and the consequences of overtreating patients, was developed to evaluate the societal cost-effectiveness (CE) of magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, duplex ultrasonography (US), and DSA. Our main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs (in dollars), and incremental CE ratios. The base-case analysis considered a cohort of 60-year old male patients without a history of coronary artery disease who presented with severe claudication to undergo pretreatment imaging workup. RESULTS: The range in effectiveness and lifetime costs among different diagnostic workup strategies was small (largest difference in effectiveness: 0.025 QALYs; largest difference in lifetime costs: $1,800). If treatment was limited to angioplasty in patients with suitable lesions, MR angiography had an incremental CE ratio of $35,000 per QALY compared with no diagnostic workup, and DSA had an incremental CE ratio of $471,000 per QALY compared with MR angiography. If treatment options included both angioplasty and bypass surgery, DSA had an incremental CE ratio of $179,000 per QALY compared with no diagnostic workup, and MR angiography and duplex US were less effective and more costly.

2226,Lung cancer screening with helical computed tomography in older adult smokers: a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,"CONTEXT: Encouraged by direct-to-consumer marketing, smokers and their physicians are contemplating lung cancer screening with a promising but unproven imaging procedure, helical computed tomography (CT). OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening with helical CT in various efficacy scenarios. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Using a computer-simulated model, we compared annual helical CT screening to no screening for hypothetical cohorts of 100 000 current, quitting, and former heavy smokers, aged 60 years, of whom 55% were men. We simulated efficacy by changing the clinical stage distribution of lung cancers so that the screened group would have fewer advanced-stage cancers and more localized-stage cancers than the nonscreened group (ie, a stage shift). Our model incorporated known biases in screening programs such as lead time, length, and overdiagnosis bias. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured the benefits of screening by comparing the absolute and relative difference in lung cancer-specific deaths. We measured harms by the number of false-positive invasive tests or surgeries per 100 000 and incremental cost-effectiveness in US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, assuming a 50% stage shift, the current heavy smoker cohort had 553 fewer lung cancer deaths (13% lung cancer-specific mortality reduction) and 1186 false-positive invasive procedures per 100 000 persons. The incremental cost-effectiveness for current smokers was $116 300 per QALY gained. For quitting and former smokers, the incremental cost-effectiveness was $558 600 and $2 322 700 per QALY gained, respectively. Other than the degree of stage shift, the most influential parameters were adherence to screening, degree of length or overdiagnosis bias in the first year of screening, quality of life of persons with screen-detected localized lung cancers, cost of helical CT, and anxiety about indeterminate nodule diagnoses. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, none of these parameters was sufficient to make screening highly cost-effective for any of the cohorts. In multiway sensitivity analyses, a program screening current smokers was $42 500 per QALY gained if extremely favorable estimates were used for all of the influential parameters simultaneously. CONCLUSION: Even if efficacy is eventually proven, screening must overcome multiple additional barriers to be highly cost-effective.

2229,Cost effectiveness and cost utility of acetylcysteine versus dimethyl sulfoxide for reflex sympathetic dystrophy,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness and cost utility of acetylcysteine versus dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), from a societal viewpoint. DESIGN: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a double-dummy, double-blind, randomised, controlled trial. Patients were followed for 1 year. The primary outcome measure was the Impairment-level Sum Score (ISS). Utilities were determined by the EuroQOL instrument (EQ-5D). Both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed. Differences in mean direct, indirect and total costs were estimated. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated by bootstrapping techniques. RESULTS: Both groups (DMSO, n = 64; acetylcysteine, n = 67) showed relevant improvement; no differences in effects were found. Only the total direct costs were significantly lower in the DMSO group for the period of 0-52 weeks. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios showed that, in general, DMSO generated fewer costs and more effects compared with acetylcysteine. Post-hoc subgroup analyses on cost effectiveness suggested that patients with warm RSD could be best treated with DMSO and patients with cold RSD with acetylcysteine. These results were based on small subsamples.

2230,Living renal donors: optimizing the imaging strategy--decision- and cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To determine the most cost-effective strategy for preoperative imaging performed in potential living renal donors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a decision-analytic model, the societal cost-effectiveness of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography, contrast material-enhanced spiral computed tomographic (CT) angiography, and combinations of these imaging techniques was evaluated. Outcome measures included lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A base-case analysis was performed with a 40-year-old female donor and a 40-year-old female recipient. RESULTS: For the donor, MR angiography (24.05 QALYs and 9,000 dollars) dominated all strategies except for MR angiography with CT angiography, which had an incremental ratio of 245,000 dollars per QALY. For the recipient, DSA and DSA with MR angiography yielded similar results (10.46 QALYs and 179,000 dollars) and dominated all other strategies. When results for donor and recipient were combined, DSA dominated all other strategies (34.51 QALYs and 188,000 dollars). If DSA was associated with a 99% specificity or less for detection of renal disease, MR angiography with CT angiography was superior (34.47 QALYs and 190,000 dollars). CONCLUSION: For preoperative imaging in a potential renal donor, DSA is the most cost-effective strategy if it has a specificity greater than 99% for detection of renal disease; otherwise, MR angiography with CT angiography is the most cost-effective strategy.",2003-01-00839,12511668,Radiology,Ylian S Liem,2003,226 / 1,53-62,No,12511668,"Ylian S Liem; Marc C J M Kock; Jan N M Ijzermans; Willem Weimar; Karen Visser; M G Myriam Hunink; Living renal donors: optimizing the imaging strategy--decision- and cost-effectiveness analysis, Radiology, 2003-Jan; 226(1):0033-8419; 53-62",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) vs. *,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2000,Not Stated
2231,Cost-effectiveness of low dose corticosteroids versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 specific inhibitors in the long-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used in nearly every patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as part of a comprehensive management programme, but their use can be associated with side-effects. Low dose corticosteroid (<10 mg/day prednisone) in the treatment of RA is controversial. Although it is effective and possibly disease modifying, concerns exist about potential adverse events. We assessed costs and health effects of corticosteroids compared with NSAIDs and cyclo-oxgenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. METHODS: Markov (state transition) models were used to simulate a cohort of RA patients taking disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and either corticosteroids or NSAIDs. The regimens were assumed to be equally effective for the control of RA. Data on incidence, costs and consequences of adverse events from corticosteroids and from NSAIDs were taken from the literature. Costs were measured in 1999 US dollars; health effects expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were performed including best-case scenarios (0.5x adverse event rate) and worst-case scenarios (1.5x adverse event rate). RESULTS: In the base-case analysis corticosteroids were superior to NSAIDs. The sensitivity analyses of adverse event rate, using best-case and worst-case scenarios, and age showed that the results were sensitive to each combination of adverse event rate and age. In contrast, the sensitivity analyses of costs and utilities were robust. Using misoprostol or omeprazole prophylaxis with NSAIDs would make corticosteroids cost-effective. Compared with NSAIDs with COX-2 specific inhibition, corticosteroids were still cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroids are more cost-effective than NSAIDs and COX-2 inhibitors in the long-term treatment of RA.",2003-01-00841,12509612,Rheumatology (Oxford),Sang-Cheol Bae,2003,42 / 1,46-53,No,12509612,"Sang-Cheol Bae; M Corzillius; Karen M Kuntz; M H Liang; Cost-effectiveness of low dose corticosteroids versus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 specific inhibitors in the long-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Rheumatology (Oxford), 2003-Jan; 42(1):1462-0324; 46-53",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) plus corticosteriods vs. Any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) plus non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-5238.1,United States,1999,-8137.31
2232,Cost-effectiveness analysis of predischarge monitoring for apnea of prematurity,"OBJECTIVE: It is standard practice to defer discharge of premature infants until they have achieved a set number of days without experiencing apnea. The duration of this period, however, is highly variable across institutions, and there is scant literature on its effectiveness or value-for-money. Our objective was to establish the economic impact of varying durations of predischarge observation for apnea of prematurity. METHODS: Using computer simulation, we compared the alternatives of hospital monitoring for 1 to 10 days, after apparent cessation of apnea, with no monitoring and with the next longest period of monitoring. The daily probability of apnea requiring stimulation after a given number of apnea-free days was obtained from chart review of 216 infants, beginning on the day they attained both full feeds and temperature stability in an open crib. Baseline rates of survival or impairment, utilities for calculation of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), outcomes for respiratory arrest at home, and long-run costs for neurodevelopmental impairment were derived from the literature. Hospital expenditures were obtained from itemized billing records for infants on each of the final 10 days of hospitalization and converted to costs using Medicare cost-to-charge ratios. Costs are reported in 2000 US dollars. RESULTS: For infants born at 24 to 26 weeks"" gestation, each additional day of monitoring cost from $41000 per QALY saved for the first day to >$130000 per additional QALY gained for the tenth day. Cost-effectiveness was poorer for infants who were born at gestational ages >30 weeks. Results were sensitive to the proportion of charted apneas requiring stimulation that would actually progress, without intervention, to respiratory arrest.

2234,Kidney transplantation in the elderly: a decision analysis,"Transplantation offers superior life expectancy and quality of life compared with dialysis in young patients with end-stage renal failure. However, the initial risks of mortality and morbidity are high. This study used a decision analysis model to evaluate the costs and benefits of kidney transplantation versus continued dialysis for older patients with renal failure. A decision analytic model comparing cadaveric renal transplantation to continued hemodialysis treatment was developed. The base case considered a theoretical cohort of patients aged 65 yr without known comorbidity or contraindications to transplantation who would have to wait 2 yr for a cadaveric transplant. Separate models were constructed for patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease and for patients receiving an organ after a variety of wait-list times. Probability, utility, and survival data were obtained from published reports and renal registries. For 65-yr-old patients, quality-adjusted life expectancy increased by 1.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an incremental cost of $67,778 per QALY. Assuming a 2-yr wait-listed time, transplantation remained economically attractive for 70-yr-old patients (incremental cost effectiveness [ICE], $79,359 per QALY) but was less economically attractive for those over 75 yr of age (ICE, $99,553) or for 70-yr-olds with either cardiovascular disease or diabetes (ICE, $126,751 and $161,090 per QALY, respectively). The analytic results were sensitive only to the time spent waiting for the graft. The cost-effectiveness reduced such that the costs associated with one QALY were in excess of $100,000/yr when the probability of a complication was > or = 50% per 3-mo cycle and when the utility of transplantation fell below 0.62.

This study used a decision analysis model to evaluate the costs and benefits of kidney transplantation versus continued dialysis for older patients with renal failure.

DESIGN: Decision trees were built on the results from randomised controlled trials on improving coronary revascularisation. All costs were presented in UK pounds (1997 values). PATIENTS: Each year 6600 new patients with CHD are expected to require revascularisation in the UK. INTERVENTIONS: The new patients would be equally divided into those undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and those undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) i.e., percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PCTA). PTCA could be administered with or without abciximab (a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist), stent, or stent plus abciximab (stent+). RESULTS: CABG/stent alone has an incremental cost of more than 115,489 pounds per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with CABG/ PTCA+. This high incremental cost is not attractive because if CABG/ stent would be added to abciximab (CABG/stent+) its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would be 2529 pounds per extra QALY compared with CABG/stent. Therefore, the debate should not be limited to the issue of stents but it should focus on the need for administering abciximab in addition to stent. The 5-year direct costs of implementing such a strategy in the UK is expected to be 50.6 million pounds (1997 values).

2246,"A cost--utility analysis of treatment options for inguinal hernia in 1,513,008 adult patients","BACKGROUND: The controversial issue of the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is examined, employing a decision analytic method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The NSAS, NHDS (National Center for Health Statistics), HCUP-NIS (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) databases and 51 randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The study group constituted of a total of 1,513,008 hernia repairs. Projection of the clinical, economic, and quality-of-life outcomes expected from the different treatment options was done by using a Markov Monte Carlo decision model. Two logistic regression models were used to predict the probability of hospital admission after an ambulatory procedure and the probability of death after inguinal hernia repair. Four treatment strategies were modeled: (1) laparoscopic repair (LR), (2) open mesh (OM), (3) open non-mesh (ONM), and (4) expectant management. Costs were expressed in US dollars and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The main outcome measures were the average and the incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) ratios. RESULTS: Compared to the expectant management, the incremental cost per QALY gained was 605 dollars (4086 dollars, 9.04 QALYs) for LR, 697 dollars (4290 dollars, 8.975 QALYs) for OM, and 1711 dollars (6200 dollars, 8.546 QALYs) for ONM. In sensitivity analysis the two major components that affect the cost-effectiveness ratio of the different types of repair were the ambulatory facility cost and the recurrence rate. At a LR ambulatory facility cost of 5526 dollars the ICER of LR compared to OM surpasses the threshold of 50,000 dollars/QALY.

2248,"A cost--utility analysis of treatment options for inguinal hernia in 1,513,008 adult patients","BACKGROUND: The controversial issue of the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair is examined, employing a decision analytic method. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The NSAS, NHDS (National Center for Health Statistics), HCUP-NIS (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) databases and 51 randomized controlled trials were analyzed. The study group constituted of a total of 1,513,008 hernia repairs. Projection of the clinical, economic, and quality-of-life outcomes expected from the different treatment options was done by using a Markov Monte Carlo decision model. Two logistic regression models were used to predict the probability of hospital admission after an ambulatory procedure and the probability of death after inguinal hernia repair. Four treatment strategies were modeled: (1) laparoscopic repair (LR), (2) open mesh (OM), (3) open non-mesh (ONM), and (4) expectant management. Costs were expressed in US dollars and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The main outcome measures were the average and the incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) ratios. RESULTS: Compared to the expectant management, the incremental cost per QALY gained was 605 dollars (4086 dollars, 9.04 QALYs) for LR, 697 dollars (4290 dollars, 8.975 QALYs) for OM, and 1711 dollars (6200 dollars, 8.546 QALYs) for ONM. In sensitivity analysis the two major components that affect the cost-effectiveness ratio of the different types of repair were the ambulatory facility cost and the recurrence rate. At a LR ambulatory facility cost of 5526 dollars the ICER of LR compared to OM surpasses the threshold of 50,000 dollars/QALY.

2249,Laparoscopic versus open donor nephrectomy,"BACKGROUND: As compared with open donor nephrectomy (OpenDN), laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LapDN) offers donors more rapid recovery and recipients equivalent graft function, but LapDN costs remain greater. This study compared LapDN and OpenDN with cost-utility analysis. METHODS: Utilities were assessed with time trade-off, probabilities derived from systematic review of the literature and the costs derived from 27 OpenDN and 34 LapDN patients treated contemporaneously. A societal perspective was taken. Lost employment costs were included. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated with best- and worst-case scenarios for confidence intervals. Sensitivity analyses assessed robustness. RESULTS: LapDN costs are lower (11,170.71 dollars vs 12,631.91 dollars), whereas quality of life (QOL) is superior (0.7247 vs 0.6585 quality-adjusted life years [QALY], rendering LapDN a dominant strategy. The model was robust to all variables, and LapDN remained dominant from a payer perspective. In a worst-case scenario, the ICER for LapDN was at most 2,231.61 dollars per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: LapDN offers improved QOL at lower costs, despite the fact that this analysis included patients treated during the learning curve of LapDN at our institution.

2250,A stochastic economic evaluation of letrozole versus tamoxifen as a first-line hormonal therapy: for advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal patients,"BACKGROUND: Letrozole is a third-generation aromatase inhibitor that is a feasible alternative to tamoxifen as a first-line hormonal therapy for patients with advanced breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents the results of an economic evaluation comparing letrozole and tamoxifen as first-line hormonal therapies in postmenopausal women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer. PERSPECTIVE: UK National Health Service. DESIGN: A decision model (Markov process) was built describing possible patient pathways from the point of diagnosis to death. The model was populated using patient-specific clinical trial data, data from the existing literature, and expert opinion. Stochastic analyses of the model were undertaken, whereby the majority of the input parameters were described as probability distributions to represent the uncertainty about their true value. Costs were presented in year 2000 values. RESULTS: The baseline results showed that letrozole is a cost-effective alternative to tamoxifen with a mean incremental cost per life-year gained of pound 2342, whilst the incremental cost increases to just over pound 10,000 at the 95th percentile of the cost-effectiveness range (2000 values).

2251,Cost-effectiveness of brief cognitive behaviour therapy versus treatment as usual in recurrent deliberate self-harm: a decision-making approach,"BACKGROUND: Deliberate self-harm can be costly, in terms of treatment and subsequent suicide. Any intervention that reduces episodes of self-harm might therefore have a major impact on the costs incurred by service providers and the productivity losses due to illness or premature death. METHOD: Four hundred and eighty patients with a history of recurrent deliberate self-harm were randomized to manual-assisted cognitive behaviour therapy (MACT) or treatment as usual. Economic data were collected from patients at baseline, 6 and 12 months, and these data were complete for 397 patients. Incremental cost-effectiveness was explored using the primary outcome measure, proportion of patients having a repeat episode of deliberate self-harm, and quality of life. The uncertainty surrounding costs and effects was represented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Differences in total cost per patient were statistically significant at 6 months in favour of MACT (pounds sterling -897, 95 % CI -1747 to -48, P=0.04), but these differences did not remain significant at 12 months (pounds sterling -838, 95% CI -2142 to 466, P=0.21). Nevertheless, exploration of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates suggests there is >90% probability that MACT is a more cost-effective strategy for reducing the recurrence of deliberate self-harm in this population over 1 year than treatment as usual. The results for quality of life were not conclusive. CONCLUSION: Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves demonstrate that, based on the evidence currently available, to reject MACT on traditional grounds of statistical significance and to continue funding current practice has <10% chance of being the correct decision in terms of cost-effectiveness.",2003-01-01155,12946082,Psychol Med,S Byford,2003,33 / 6,977-86,No,12946082,"S Byford; Martin Knapp; J Greenshields; O C Ukoumunne; V Jones; Sandra Thompson; P Tyrer; Ulrike Schmidt; K Davidson; Martin Knapp; J Greenshields; O C Ukoumunne; V Jones; Sandra Thompson; P Tyrer; Ulrike Schmidt; K Davidson; Cost-effectiveness of brief cognitive behaviour therapy versus treatment as usual in recurrent deliberate self-harm: a decision-making approach, Psychol Med, 2003-Aug; 33(6):1469-8978; 977-86",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Manual-assisted congnitive behavioral therapy vs. Usual care (i.e. problem-solving, psychotherapy)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,66000,United Kingdom,2000,150338.28
2252,Cost-effective outcome for treating poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to prospectively assess outcome and cost for poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage patients presenting to a regional neurosurgical center (Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK) between 1994 and 2001. Outcome measures were clinical outcome at 6 months, number needed to treat (NNT) for favorable outcomes, and cost analysis. METHODS: Poor-grade patients (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons grades 4 and 5) were transferred to the neurocritical care unit after intubation and ventilation. After resuscitation and drainage of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid for 24 hours, sedation was stopped, and patients were assessed clinically. Patients with a Glasgow Motor Score (GMS) > or =4 underwent angiography and surgical treatment of culprit aneurysms. Patients with a subsequent GMS of 6 were not deemed poor grade and were discounted from the study. RESULTS: We deemed 166 ventilated patients genuinely poor grade (mean age, 53.4 years; 94 women [56.6%]). Of these, 88 patients (4<GMS<6; 53%) progressed to angiography and possible definitive treatment. Seventy-five patients had an identifiable aneurysm, but only 64 survived for treatment. Operative mortality was 31.3%, and of the 44 survivors, 22 (34.4% of operated patients) achieved a favorable outcome. Favorable outcomes were more frequently seen in women than men (21.3% versus 6.9%) but were unrelated to patient age. The NNT for 1 favorable outcome was 7 (male NNT, 15; female NNT, 5) at a cost of pound 84 336 per favorable outcome (female, pound 60 240; male, pound 180 720).

2253,Benefits and costs of immunization of children with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Canada,"To estimate cost-effectiveness of routine and catch-up vaccination of Canadian children with seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, a simulation model was constructed. In base scenario (vaccination coverage: 80%, and vaccine price: 58 dollars per dose), pneumococcal disease incidence reduction would be superior to 60% for invasive infections, and to 30% for non-invasive infections, but the number of deaths prevented would be small. Annual costs of routine immunization would be 71 million dollars (98% borne by the health system). Societal benefit to cost ratio would be 0.57. Net societal costs per averted pneumococcal disease would be 389 dollars and 125,000 per life-year gained (LYG). Vaccine purchase cost is the most important variable in sensitivity analyses, and program costs would be superior to societal benefits in all likely scenarios. Vaccination would result in net savings for society, if vaccine cost is less than 30 dollars per dose.

2258,Should radon be reduced in homes? A cost-effect analysis,"BACKGROUND: Radon is a radioactive gas that may leak into buildings from the ground. Radon exposure is a risk factor for lung cancer. An intervention against radon exposure in homes may consist of locating homes with high radon exposure (above 200 Bq m(-3)) and improving these, and protecting future houses. The purpose of this paper is to calculate the costs and the effects of this intervention. METHODS: We performed a cost-effect analysis from the perspective of the society, followed by an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. The distribution of radon levels in Norwegian homes is lognormal with mean = 74.5 Bq m(-3), and 7.6% above 200 Bq m(-3). RESULTS: The preventable attributable fraction of radon on lung cancer was 3.8% (95% uncertainty interval: 0.6%, 8.3%). In cumulative present values the intervention would cost $238 (145, 310) million and save 892 (133, 1981) lives; each life saved costs $0.27 (0.09, 0.9) million. The cost-effect ratio was sensitive to the radon risk, the radon exposure distribution, and the latency period of lung cancer. Together these three parameters explained 90% of the variation in the cost-effect ratio. CONCLUSIONS: The uncertainty in the estimated cost per life is large, mainly due to uncertainty in the risk of lung cancer from radon. Based on estimates from road construction, the Norwegian society has been willing to pay $1 million to save a life. This is above the upper uncertainty limit of the cost per life.

2265,The use of probabilistic decision models in technology assessment : the case of total hip replacement,"There is increasing recognition that decision modelling is central to health technology assessment and, in particular, to analyses to support formal decision making regarding the funding of the use of new technologies. In part, the key role of decision analysis stems from the need to handle multiple sources of uncertainty in the available evidence. The use of probabilistic decision analysis is a means of reflecting the parameter uncertainty in models and presenting this in a comprehensible manner to decision makers. In this article, we demonstrate the potential role of probabilistic models using the case study of total hip replacement surgery.A cost-effectiveness model was constructed to compare the Charnley and Spectron hip prostheses in terms of lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Revision rates were estimated from the Swedish National Total Hip Arthroplasty Register (1992-2000); the risk of revision with the Spectron prosthesis relative to the Charnley prosthesis was 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32, 1.02) for early revisions and 0.26 (95% CI 0.07, 0.46) for late revisions. This lower revision risk resulted in the Spectron generating more QALYs than the Charnley prosthesis. Based on mean costs and QALYs, the Spectron results in cost savings in younger patients, and generates incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of between pound1000 and pound16 000 in older patient groups. The probabilistic results from the model indicated that, if it is assumed that decision makers are willing to pay up to pound20 000 per additional QALY, the probability of the Spectron being the more cost-effective prosthesis ranged between 70% and 100%, depending on the age and sex of the patient.This article looks at the application of probabilistic decision modelling using total hip replacement as a case study to emphasis the need for decision models to quantify all sources of parameter uncertainty and to clearly distinguish parameter uncertainty from subgroup heterogeneity.",2004-01-00014,15702945,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Andrew Briggs,2005,3 / 2,79-89,Yes,15702945,"Andrew Briggs; Mark Sculpher; Jill Dawson; Ray Fitzpatrick; David Murray; Henrik Malchau; Mark Sculpher; Jill Dawson; Ray Fitzpatrick; David Murray; Henrik Malchau; The use of probabilistic decision models in technology assessment : the case of total hip replacement, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2004; 3(2):1179-1896; 79-89",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hip replacement with the Spectron prosthesis vs. Hip replacement with the Charnley prosthesis,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Male,Full,60 Years,6.00,1.50,-1000,United Kingdom,2000,-2277.85
2266,The use of probabilistic decision models in technology assessment : the case of total hip replacement,"There is increasing recognition that decision modelling is central to health technology assessment and, in particular, to analyses to support formal decision making regarding the funding of the use of new technologies. In part, the key role of decision analysis stems from the need to handle multiple sources of uncertainty in the available evidence. The use of probabilistic decision analysis is a means of reflecting the parameter uncertainty in models and presenting this in a comprehensible manner to decision makers. In this article, we demonstrate the potential role of probabilistic models using the case study of total hip replacement surgery.A cost-effectiveness model was constructed to compare the Charnley and Spectron hip prostheses in terms of lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Revision rates were estimated from the Swedish National Total Hip Arthroplasty Register (1992-2000); the risk of revision with the Spectron prosthesis relative to the Charnley prosthesis was 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.32, 1.02) for early revisions and 0.26 (95% CI 0.07, 0.46) for late revisions. This lower revision risk resulted in the Spectron generating more QALYs than the Charnley prosthesis. Based on mean costs and QALYs, the Spectron results in cost savings in younger patients, and generates incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of between pound1000 and pound16 000 in older patient groups.

2267,Pharmacoeconomic assessment of oseltamivir in treating influenza--the case of otherwise healthy Danish adolescents and adults,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the pharmacoeconomics of treating influenza with oseltamivir in healthy Danish adolescents and adults. METHOD: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were used to compare oseltamivir to usual care (symptomatic treatment with over the counter (OTC) medicine), considering both the societal and health care payer""s perspectives. The population group studied was otherwise healthy adolescents and adults, aged 13 to 64. Danish data were collected to simulate results that are specific to Denmark. The economic model included first- and second-order Monte Carlo simulations. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The cost-effectiveness study was expressed as gain in cost per day to return to normal activity, and the cost-utility study as cost per QALY (quality adjusted life years) gained. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, oseltamivir was a dominant treatment compared to usual care. From a health care payer""s perspective, the cost-effectiveness ratio was 12.3 euros per gain in day to return to normal activity and 5,063 euros/QALY gained. A sensitivity analysis leaving out hospitalisation, complications, and mortality showed increased cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios. However, treatment with oseltamivir remained cost-effective, assuming a willingness to pay for health benefits at 26,174 euros/QALY. CONCLUSION: Pharmacoeconomic analyses of influenza treatment with oseltamivir in an otherwise healthy Danish adolescent/adult population show that this treatment saves money for society and is associated with a relatively low cost from a health care payer""s perspective.

2272,Cost-utility analysis of imatinib mesylate for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase,"BACKGROUND: Imatinib mesylate is a targeted therapy for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the incremental cost-utility of imatinib mesylate compared with hydroxyurea in patients with chronic-phase CML for whom first-line treatment with interferon-alpha failed to produce a response. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate disease progression for hypothetical patients receiving imatinib mesylate or hydroxyurea, who had not previously responded to interferon-a therapy, to determine outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Service. Patient data were derived from previously published trials. RESULTS: The Markov model simulated the transitions of a hypothetical sample of 1000 chronic-phase CML patients using 1 monthly cycle over the lifetime of the patient sample. Median survival rates were estimated to be 77 months for imatinib mesylate-treated patients and 56 months for hydroxyurea-treated patients. Patients receiving imatinib mesylate accrued 5.95 QALYs, whereas hydroxyurea-treated patients accrued 3.49 QALYs. The estimated per-patient lifetime costs were 110,103 pound sterlings for patients in the imatinib mesylate group and 15,566 pound sterlings for patients in the hydroxyurea group (year-2001 values). The estimated year-2001 incremental cost per QALY gained from using imatinib mesylate compared with hydroxyurea in chronic phase CML was 38,468 pound sterlings. CONCLUSIONS: In the present model analysis, imatinib mesylate as a second-line treatment for patients with chronic phase CML was found to offer considerable health benefits to patients, but at a cost to the payer. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 38,468 pound sterlings (year-2001 values).",2004-01-00043,15639704,Clin Ther,Emma Warren,2004,26 / 11,1924-33,Yes,15639704,"Emma Warren; Sue Ward; Adam Gordois; Paul Scuffham; Sue Ward; Adam Gordois; Paul Scuffham; Cost-utility analysis of imatinib mesylate for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in the chronic phase, Clin Ther, 2004-Nov; 26(11):1879-114X; 1924-33",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with imatinib mesylate vs. Treatment with hydroxyurea,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,1.50,38468,United Kingdom,2001,80931.97

2277,Procuring organ donors as a health investment: how much should we be willing to spend?,"BACKGROUND: This paper examines the benefits and costs that accrue when a cadaveric organ donor is procured. We estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for donor procurement. Our objective was not only to see whether organ procurement is a ""good"" health investment, but also to clarify how much it is worth spending to obtain additional donors. METHODS: We calculated the average number of kidney, heart, and liver transplants that a typical cadaveric donor generates. Relying primarily on reviewing the published literature, we estimated for each organ type the average number of QALYs that transplants add and the average medical costs they generate. We multiplied per organ benefits and costs by the number of organs from the typical donor, and summed the results to calculate the cost per QALY from procuring an additional donor. We conducted extensive sensitivity analyses of the assumptions. RESULTS: Our central estimate indicates that the typical donor generates about 13 QALYs at an added medical cost of about $214,000, a cost of approximately $16,000 per QALY. Our high estimate is approximately $57,000. CONCLUSIONS: The implications of these findings depend upon how we choose to value QALYs. Most analysts agree that a figure of $100,000 is reasonable. At this value, the benefit obtained from one added donor would be $1.3 million (13 x $100,000) while the medical costs would be $214,000.

2279,Procuring organ donors as a health investment: how much should we be willing to spend?,"BACKGROUND: This paper examines the benefits and costs that accrue when a cadaveric organ donor is procured. We estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for donor procurement. Our objective was not only to see whether organ procurement is a ""good"" health investment, but also to clarify how much it is worth spending to obtain additional donors. METHODS: We calculated the average number of kidney, heart, and liver transplants that a typical cadaveric donor generates. Relying primarily on reviewing the published literature, we estimated for each organ type the average number of QALYs that transplants add and the average medical costs they generate. We multiplied per organ benefits and costs by the number of organs from the typical donor, and summed the results to calculate the cost per QALY from procuring an additional donor. We conducted extensive sensitivity analyses of the assumptions. RESULTS: Our central estimate indicates that the typical donor generates about 13 QALYs at an added medical cost of about $214,000, a cost of approximately $16,000 per QALY. Our high estimate is approximately $57,000. CONCLUSIONS: The implications of these findings depend upon how we choose to value QALYs. Most analysts agree that a figure of $100,000 is reasonable.

2280,Cost effectiveness of raloxifene in the treatment of osteoporosis in Sweden: an economic evaluation based on the MORE study,"BACKGROUND: The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) study showed that treatment with raloxifene reduces the risk of vertebral fracture and breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE: Based on the MORE study the aim of the present study was to assess the cost effectiveness of raloxifene (compared with no treatment) for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women in Sweden. DESIGN: A revised version of a previously developed computer simulation model was used. The impact of the risk-reducing effect of raloxifene on vertebral fractures and breast cancer on cost effectiveness was analysed using a clinical and a morphometric definition of vertebral fracture. Benefits of raloxifene treatment were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and life-years gained. The study estimated the cost effectiveness mainly from a healthcare perspective but the cost effectiveness taking a societal perspective was also analysed. RESULTS: Intervention costs (in Swedish kronor [SEK] and euros [euro], year 2001 values) in postmenopausal women with a relative risk of vertebral fracture of 2 were SEK372000 (euro40000), SEK303000 (euro33000) and SEK263000 (euro28000) per QALY for women aged 60, 70 and 80 years, at start of treatment, respectively, when the clinical vertebral definition was used. The cost effectiveness using a clinical morphometric vertebral fracture definition was similar to the cost effectiveness using a clinical vertebral fracture definition.

The present study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening and determine acceptable strategies. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model was performed from a societal perspective to measure the clinical benefit and economic consequences of CAD screening in asymptomatic men with diabetes and two additional atherogenic risk factors. We evaluated cohorts of patients stratified by different age groups, and 10 possible combination pairs of atherogenic risks. Incremental cost-effectiveness of no screening, exercise electrocardiography, exercise echocardiography, or exercise single-photon emission-tomography (SPECT) was calculated. Input data were obtained from the published literature. Outcomes were expressed as U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Compared with no screening, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of exercise electrocardiography was $41,600/QALY in 60-year-old asymptomatic diabetic men with hypertension and smoking, but was weakly dominated by exercise echocardiography. Exercise echocardiography was most cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40,800/QALY. Exercise SPECT was dominated by other strategies.

2286,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a complementary health intervention: the case of smoking relapse prevention,"OBJECTIVES: We assess the cost-effectiveness of smoking relapse prevention interventions designed to keep quitters from resuming the use of cigarettes. Because relapse prevention is complementary to smoking cessation efforts, the appropriate test of its cost-effectiveness is whether it reduces the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of smoking cessation. The major goal of the study is to carry out such a test. METHODS: Data from a randomized trial that ascertained the effectiveness of alternative modes of smoking relapse prevention are combined with ICER estimates of smoking cessation to assess whether relapse prevention is cost-effective. RESULTS: The trial produced convincing evidence that relapse prevention yields statistically significant reductions in the proportion of quitters who are smoking at 24 months postquit. The intervention effects are substantial enough to raise the denominator terms of the smoking cessation ICER and, thereby, offset the amount relapse prevention adds to cost numerator terms. In this sense, smoking relapse prevention tends to pay for itself. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking relapse prevention is a highly cost-effective addition to current efforts to curb cigarette consumption.

2288,Cost effectiveness of tension-free vaginal tape for the surgical management of female stress incontinence,"OBJECTIVES: Stress urinary incontinence affects between 10 percent and 50 percent of women. Surgery is commonly recommended for troublesome incontinence that does not respond to nonsurgical management. Tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) is a newer, minimal access surgical sling procedure, which is being increasingly adopted worldwide. The cost-effectiveness of TVT in comparison with other surgical procedures, particularly open colposuspension, is assessed. METHODS: Effectiveness estimates came from a systematic review of TVT compared with other surgical procedures (open and laparoscopic colposuspension, traditional slings, and injectables). Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were used to assess the likelihood of TVT being cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of changing assumptions about cure rates and costs for TVT, cure rates for retreatment open colposuspension, and proportions of women who choose retreatment. RESULTS: Reliable estimates of relative effectiveness were difficult to derive because the few randomized controlled comparisons had not been optimally analyzed or fully reported. Results of the economic model suggested that TVT dominates open colposuspension (lower cost and same quality of life years [QALYs]) within 5 years after surgery. Stochastic analysis indicated that the likelihood of TVT being cost-effective was 100 percent if decision-makers are unwilling to pay for additional QALYs. TVT""s dominance depended on the assumption fact that retreatment open colposuspension has lower cure rates than a first colposuspension. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis based on current short-term data indicates dominance of TVT over open colposuspension from approximately 5 years. There is a need for longer-term follow-up data from methodologically rigorous randomized trials to provide a sounder basis for estimating the relative benefits and cost implications.",2004-01-00062,15609795,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Mary Kilonzo,2004,20 / 4,455-63,No,15609795,"Mary Kilonzo; Luke Vale; Sally C Stearns; Adrian Grant; June Cody; Cathryn M A Glazener; Sheila Wallace; Kirsty McCormack; Luke Vale; Sally C Stearns; Adrian Grant; June Cody; Cathryn M A Glazener; Sheila Wallace; Kirsty McCormack; Cost effectiveness of tension-free vaginal tape for the surgical management of female stress incontinence, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2004; 20(4):0266-4623; 455-63",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tension-free vaginal tape vs. Open abdominal retropubic colposuspension,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,10 Years,6.00,1.50,-48154,United Kingdom,2001,-101310.13
2289,The economic implications of non-adherence after renal transplantation,"BACKGROUND: The economic impact of therapeutic non-adherence in chronic diseases has rarely been examined using qualitative standards for economic evaluation. This study illustrates the impact of non-adherence on the cost utility of renal transplantation versus haemodialysis from the societal perspective and examines the scope for adherence-enhancing interventions. METHODS: Long-term costs and outcomes in adherent and non-adherent renal transplant patients were simulated in a Markov model. The cost (euros, year 2000 values) and outcome data that were imputed in the model were derived from a prospective study in renal transplantation candidates performed in 2002. Probabilities of adverse events, graft rejection, graft loss and death in adherent and non-adherent renal transplant patients were derived from literature. RESULTS: Compared with dialysis, renal transplantation offers a better outcome in both adherent and non-adherent patients. Lifetime costs after transplantation in the adherent patient group are higher than lifetime dialysis costs and lifetime costs in the non-adherent patient group, mainly because adherent patients live longer after transplantation. Long-term outcomes after transplantation are better for adherent than for non-adherent patients. The mean cost per QALY gained in adherent patients relative to non-adherent patients was euro 35 021 per QALY (95% CI 26 959, 46 620). CONCLUSION: Compared with established healthcare interventions, such as haemodialysis, renal transplantation can be considered a cost-effective therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease, even if patients are non-adherent after transplantation. The low incremental cost per QALY calculated in this model for adherent renal transplant patients, suggests there may be scope for adherence-enhancing interventions (provided that such interventions with a sufficiently high effectiveness exist or can be developed). As the findings are based on simulated long-term costs and outcomes, they should not be considered as precise estimates of the impact of non-adherence. This study is rather meant as an illustration of how non-adherence may impact on the results of cost-effectiveness analyses.",2004-01-00075,15606228,Pharmacoeconomics,Irina Cleemput,2004,22 / 17,1217-34,Yes,15606228,"Irina Cleemput; Katrien Kesteloot; Yves Vanrenterghem; Sabina De Geest; Katrien Kesteloot; Yves Vanrenterghem; Sabina De Geest; The economic implications of non-adherence after renal transplantation, Pharmacoeconomics, 2004; 22(17):1179-2027; 1217-34",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adherence to immunosuppressive medication vs. Non-adherence,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,35021,Euro,2000,48592.1
2290,A short course of cardiac rehabilitation program is highly cost effective in improving long-term quality of life in patients with recent myocardial infarction or percutaneous coronary intervention,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term effect of a cardiac rehabilitation and prevention program (CRPP) on quality of life (QOL) and its cost effectiveness. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University-affiliated outpatient cardiac rehabilitation and prevention center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 269 patients (76% men; mean age, 64+/-11 y) with recent acute myocardial infarction (AMI; n=193) or after elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI; n=76) were randomized in a ratio of 2 to 1. INTERVENTION: Patients received either CRPP (an 8-wk exercise and education class in phase 2) or conventional therapy without exercise program (control group). They were followed until they had completed all 4 phases of the program (ie, 2 y). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: QOL assessments, by using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Symptoms Questionnaire, were performed at the end of each phase. Direct health care cost was calculated, whereas cost utility was estimated as money spent (in US dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the CRPP group, 6 of the 8 SF-36 dimensions improved significantly by phase 2 and were maintained throughout the study period. Patients were less anxious and depressed, and felt more relaxed and contented. In the control group, none of the SF-36 dimensions were improved by phase 2, and bodily pain was increased. In phase 4, only 4 dimensions were improved. Symptoms were unchanged except for increased hostility score. There was a significant gain in net time trade-off in the CRPP group after phase 2. The direct health care expenses in the CRPP and control groups were 15,292 dollars and 15,707 dollars per patient, respectively. Therefore, the cost utility calculated was 640 dollars saved per QALY gained. Savings attributable to CRPP were primarily explained by the lower rate (13% vs 26% of patients, chi2 test=3.9, P <.05) and cost of subsequent PCI (P =.01).

2291,Modeling the 5-year cost effectiveness of treatment strategies including tumor necrosis factor-blocking agents and leflunomide for treating rheumatoid arthritis in the Netherlands,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of treatment strategies for rheumatoid arthritis patients satisfying the indication for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-blocking treatment. METHODS: A Markov model study was performed. The following treatment strategies were considered: 1) usual treatment; 2) treatment with leflunomide, in the case of nonresponse after 3 months, switch to usual treatment; 3) TNF-blocking treatment, in the case of nonresponse after 3 months, switch to usual treatment; 4) treatment with leflunomide, in the case of nonresponse, switch to TNF-blocking treatment, in the case of nonresponse to TNF-blocking treatment, switch to usual treatment; 5) TNF-blocking treatment, in the case of nonresponse, switch to leflunomide treatment, in the case of nonresponse to leflunomide, switch to usual treatment. Expected patient-years in the different Markov states, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared between the treatment strategies; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: Over the 5-year period, the expected effect on disease activity and QALYs was better for treatment strategies that included TNF-blocking treatment than for the other treatment strategies. The greater effectiveness of these treatment strategies reduced medical and nonmedical costs compared with usual treatment by about 16% and 33%, respectively, omitting the costs of medication. When the costs of medication were included, the costs of strategies that started with TNF-blocking treatment were higher than those of the other treatment strategies. Treatment strategy 4 had the most favorable ICER of the treatment strategies that included TNF-blocking treatment: 163,556/QALY compared with usual treatment.

2295,Cost-effectiveness of herpes simplex virus type 2 serologic testing and antiviral therapy in pregnancy,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether serologic testing for herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) in pregnant women and their partners is cost-effective. STUDY DESIGN: A decision analysis model was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of providing type-specific serologic testing at week 15 of pregnancy for all women unaware of their HSV-2 status, and offering antiviral suppressive therapy from week 36 until delivery to all seropositive women. This scenario was compared with current care, in which only a minority of women diagnosed with genital herpes (GH) receives antiviral suppressive therapy (AST). In a third scenario, testing is offered to partners of pregnant women who test seronegative, and antiviral suppressive therapy is offered to the partners who test seropositive. RESULTS: Compared with current care, offering testing and antiviral suppressive therapy to 100,000 pregnant women resulted in an incremental cost of $3.1 million, 15.7 fewer cases of neonatal herpes, 186 fewer cesarean deliveries, and an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life- year gained (QALY) of $18,680. Offering testing and suppressive therapy to both the pregnant women and their partners resulted in an increased cost of $8.6 million, 16.8 fewer cases of neonatal herpes, 192 fewer cesarean deliveries, and an incremental cost per QALY of $48,946 compared with no testing.

2298,Model study of AREDS antioxidant supplementation of AMD compared to Visudyne: a dominant strategy?,"OBJECTIVES: In Ontario, Canada, in a cohort of all people initially aged 50-54 years, modeling whether the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) antioxidant supplementation for stage 3 and 4 AMD would decrease the costs of photodynamic treatment with Visudyne. PERSPECTIVE: Third party payer, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan. METHODS: Using reported risk reductions, prevalence data by age and sex from the Beaver Dam studies, and yearly costs: AREDS 182.50 Canadian dollars, potential savings were calculated as the difference or incremental cost between the estimated medical costs for the untreated cohort of 17,000 Canadian dollars for Visudyne treatment of individuals with neovascularization and the same cohort if stage 3 and 4 AMD patients were treated with antioxidants, decreasing progression to neovascularization. Different scenarios were explored for sensitivity analysis of direct cost savings. RESULTS: For the Ontario cohort of approximately 788,000 aged 51-55 years in 2001, for photodynamic therapy of the untreated cohort, modeled costs were 1.7 billion Canadian dollars. AREDS treatment costs would be 513 million Canadian dollars. AREDS would reduce photodynamic therapy costs, a net saving of 431 million Canadian dollars, a saving of 547 Canadian dollars per person in the total cohort, or 6,753 Canadian dollars per stage 3 and 4 patient treated. To explore the sensitivity of this model to AMD incidence rather than prevalence data, Framingham incidence data were incorporated in the model: net savings of 70.3 million Canadian dollars were modeled using Framingham incidence data. CONCLUSION: Under reasonable assumptions, if the case progresses to wet AMD (1) AREDS with Visudyne is less expensive than Visudyne alone in every five-year time period for the cohort that is age 50-54 right now until they become 75-79; thus, the lifetime cost is lower; (2) AREDS with Visudyne yields more QALYs than Visudyne alone in every five-year interval; (3) under all but the most extreme assumptions, the conclusions reached are robust. Even when AREDS costs a little more, it yields more QALYs at a reasonable cost per QALY. Thus, AREDS antioxidant supplementation appears to be a dominant strategy for macular degeneration. Applied to the whole Canadian population, the potential medical cost savings for Visudyne treatment of neovascular AMD are 5.6 billion Canadian dollars in direct costs.

2300,Cost-effectiveness of HIV postexposure prophylaxis following sexual or injection drug exposure in 96 metropolitan areas in the United States,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) following sexual or injection-related exposures in 96 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States (MSA). DESIGN: Empirical, model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: Epidemiological and population size estimates from the literature were combined with information about the distribution of exposure types, PEP completion rate, proportion of source partners known to be HIV infected, and PEP program costs obtained from a feasibility study of PEP in San Francisco to estimate the cost-effectiveness of hypothetical PEP programs in each of the 96 MSA. The effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy following sexual or drug use-related exposures, which is presently not known, was assumed equal to the effectiveness of zidovudine monotherapy in the occupational setting. The main outcome measure was the cost-utility ratio, defined as the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved by the PEP intervention. RESULTS: The cost-utility ratios for the 96 MSA ranged from 4137 dollars to 39,101 dollars per QALY saved; only two of the ratios exceeded 30,000 dollars per QALY saved. Combined across the 96 MSA, the hypothetical PEP programs would reach nearly 20,000 clients at a total cost of approximately 22 million dollars. The overall cost-utility ratio across MSA was 12,567 dollars per QALY saved. The majority of the HIV infections prevented by PEP were among men and women who reported receptive anal intercourse exposure.
