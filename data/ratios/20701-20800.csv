20701,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination strategies for adolescent girls and boys in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most widespread sexually transmitted infection worldwide. It causes several health consequences, in particular accounting for the majority of cervical cancer cases in women. In the United Kingdom, a vaccination campaign targeting 12-year-old girls started in 2008; this campaign has been successful, with high uptake and reduced HPV prevalence observed in vaccinated cohorts. Recently, attention has focused on vaccinating both sexes, due to HPV-related diseases in males (particularly for high-risk men who have sex with men) and an equity argument over equalising levels of protection. METHODS: We constructed an epidemiological model for HPV transmission in the UK, accounting for nine of the most common HPV strains. We complemented this with an economic model to determine the likely health outcomes (healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years) for individuals from the epidemiological model. We then tested vaccination with the three HPV vaccines currently available, vaccinating either girls alone or both sexes. For each strategy we calculated the threshold price per vaccine dose, i.e. the maximum amount paid for the added health benefits of vaccination to be worth the cost of each vaccine dose. We calculated results at 3.5% discounting, and also 1.5%, to consider the long-term health effects of HPV infection. RESULTS: At 3.5% discounting, continuing to vaccinate girls remains highly cost-effective compared to halting vaccination, with threshold dose prices of pound56- pound108. Vaccination of girls and boys is less cost-effective ( pound25- pound53). Compared to vaccinating girls only, adding boys to the programme is not cost-effective, with negative threshold prices (- pound6 to - pound3) due to the costs of administration. All threshold prices increase when using 1.5% discounting, and adding boys becomes cost-effective ( pound36- pound47). These results are contingent on the UK''s high vaccine uptake; for lower uptake rates, adding boys (at the same uptake rate) becomes more cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating girls is extremely cost-effective compared with no vaccination, vaccinating both sexes is less so. Adding boys to an already successful girls-only programme has a low cost-effectiveness, as males have high protection through herd immunity. If future health effects are weighted more heavily, threshold prices increase and vaccination becomes cost-effective.",2019-01-29117,31234784,BMC Infect Dis,Samik Datta,2019,19 / 1,552,No,31234784,"Samik Datta; Joshua Pink; Graham F Medley; Stavros Petrou; Sophie Staniszewska; Martin Underwood; Pam Sonnenberg; Matt J Keeling; Assessing the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination strategies for adolescent girls and boys in the UK, BMC Infect Dis, 2019 Jun 24; 19(1):1471-2334; 552",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Immunization,"Historical vaccination, followed by girls & boys receiving quadrivalent HPV vaccine, cost = 60 GBP vs. Halted vaccination in 2017 with historical HPV vaccination for girls-only, using uptake rates from 2008-2016",Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,21152,United Kingdom,2014,38119.02

20710,Cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic ileocaecal resection versus infliximab treatment of terminal ileitis in Crohn's disease: the LIR!C Trial,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic ileocaecal resection compared with infliximab in patients with ileocaecal Crohn''s disease failing conventional therapy. DESIGN: A multicentre randomised controlled trial was performed in 29 centres in The Netherlands and the UK. Adult patients with Crohn''s disease of the terminal ileum who failed >3 months of conventional immunomodulators or steroids without signs of critical strictures were randomised to laparoscopic ileocaecal resection or infliximab. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) based on the EuroQol (EQ) 5D-3L Questionnaire and the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). Costs were measured from a societal perspective. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated to show uncertainty. RESULTS: In total, 143 patients were randomised. Mean Crohn''s disease total direct healthcare costs per patient at 1 year were lower in the resection group compared with the infliximab group (mean difference euro-8931; 95% CI euro-12 087 to euro-5097). Total societal costs in the resection group were lower than in the infliximab group, however not statistically significant (mean difference euro-5729, 95% CI euro-10 606 to euro172). The probability of resection being cost-effective compared with infliximab was 0.96 at a willingness to pay (WTP) of euro0 per QALY gained and per point improvement in IBDQ Score.

20711,"Cost-Effectiveness of Left Atrial Appendage Closure for Stroke Reduction in Atrial Fibrillation: Analysis of Pooled, 5-Year, Long-Term Data","Background Recent publications reached conflicting conclusions about the cost-effectiveness of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) with the Watchman device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) for stroke risk reduction in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). This analysis sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of LAAC relative to both warfarin and nonwarfarin oral anticoagulants (NOACs) using pooled, long-term data from the randomized PROTECT AF (Watchman Left Atrial Appendage System for Embolic Protection in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation) and PREVAIL (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Watchman LAA Closure Device in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Versus Long-Term Warfarin) trials. Methods and Results A Markov model was constructed from a US payer perspective with a lifetime (20-year) horizon. LAAC clinical event rates and stroke outcomes were from pooled PROTECT AF and PREVAIL trial 5-year data. Warfarin and NOAC inputs were derived from published meta-analyses. The model was populated with a cohort of 10 000 patients, aged 70 years, at moderate stroke and bleeding risk. Sensitivity analyses were performed. LAAC was cost-effective relative to warfarin by year 7 ($48 674/quality-adjusted life-year) and dominant (more effective and less costly) by year 10. LAAC became cost-effective and dominant compared with NOACs by year 5. Over a lifetime, LAAC provided 0.60 more quality-adjusted life-years than warfarin and 0.29 more than NOACs. In sensitivity analyses, LAAC was cost-effective relative to warfarin and NOACs in 98% and 95% of simulations, respectively.

20715,Point-of-care HIV Viral Load in Pregnant Women Without Prenatal Care: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Routine cesarean delivery has been shown to decrease mother-to-child-transmission of HIV in women with high viral load greater than 1,000 copies/mL; however, women presenting late in pregnancy may not have viral load results before delivery. OBJECTIVE: Our study investigated the costs and outcomes of using a point-of-care HIV RNA viral load test to guide delivery compared to routine cesarean delivery for all in the setting of unknown viral load. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was constructed using TreeAge software to compare HIV RNA viral load testing versus routine cesarean delivery for all in a theoretical cohort of 1,275 HIV-positive women without prenatal care who presented at term for delivery, the estimated population of HIV-positive women without prenatal care in the U.S. annually. TreeAge Pro software is used to build decision trees modeling clinical problems and perform cost-effectiveness, sensitivity, and simulation analysis to identify the optimal outcome. The average cost per test was $15.22. To examine the downstream impact of a cesarean and because most childbearing women in the U.S. will deliver two children, we incorporated a second pregnancy and delivery in the model. Primary outcomes were mother-to-child-transmission, delivery mode, cesarean-related complications, cost, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Model inputs were derived from the literature and varied in sensitivity analyses. The cost-effectiveness threshold was $100,000/QALY. RESULTS: Measuring viral load resulted in more HIV-infected neonates than routine cesarean delivery for all due to viral exposure during more frequent vaginal births in this strategy. There were no observed maternal deaths or differences in cesarean-related complications. Quantifying viral load increased cost by $3,883,371 and decreased QALYs by 63 compared to routine cesarean delivery for all. With the threshold set at $100,000/QALY, the viral load test is cost-effective only when the vertical transmission rate in women with high viral load was below 0.68% (baseline: 16.8%) and when the odds ratio of vertical transmission with routine cesarean delivery for all compared to vaginal delivery was above 0.885 (baseline: 0.3). CONCLUSION: For HIV-infected pregnant women without prenatal care, quantifying viral load to guide mode of delivery using a point-of-care test resulted in increased costs and decreased effectiveness when compared to routine cesarean delivery for all, even after including downstream complications of cesarean delivery.",2019-01-29132,31229430,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Carmen M Avram,2019,/,,No,31229430,"Carmen M Avram; Karen S Greiner; Ellen Tilden; Aaron B Caughey; Point-of-care HIV Viral Load in Pregnant Women Without Prenatal Care: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Am J Obstet Gynecol, 2019 Jun 20; ():0002-9378",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Surgical",Point-of-care HIV viral load testing pre delivery vs. Routine cesarean delivery,Pregnant without prenatal care; Uncomplicated pregnancy; >= 37 weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-60920,United States,2019,-61671.56

20718,How do the costs of physical therapy and arthroscopic partial meniscectomy compare? A trial-based economic evaluation of two treatments in patients with meniscal tears alongside the ESCAPE study,"OBJECTIVES: To examine whether physical therapy (PT) is cost-effective compared with arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) in patients with a non-obstructive meniscal tear, we performed a full trial-based economic evaluation from a societal perspective. In a secondary analysis-this paper-we examined whether PT is non-inferior to APM. METHODS: We recruited patients aged 45-70 years with a non-obstructive meniscal tear in nine Dutch hospitals. Resource use was measured using web-based questionnaires. Measures of effectiveness included knee function using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Follow-up was 24 months. Uncertainty was assessed using bootstrapping techniques. The non-inferiority margins for societal costs, the IKDC and QALYs, were euro670, 8 points and 0.057 points, respectively. RESULTS: We randomly assigned 321 patients to PT (n=162) or APM (n=159). PT was associated with significantly lower costs after 24 months compared with APM (-euro1803; 95% CI -euro3008 to -euro838). The probability of PT being cost-effective compared with APM was 1.00 at a willingness to pay of euro0/unit of effect for the IKDC (knee function) and QALYs (quality of life) and decreased with increasing values of willingness to pay. The probability that PT is non-inferior to APM was 0.97 for all non-inferiority margins for the IKDC and 0.89 for QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of PT being cost-effective compared with APM was relatively high at reasonable values of willingness to pay for the IKDC and QALYs. Also, PT had a relatively high probability of being non-inferior to APM for both outcomes. This warrants further deimplementation of APM in patients with non-obstructive meniscal tears.

20719,Insurance type impacts the economic burden and survival of patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma,"OBJECTIVE: Glioblastoma (GBM) carries a high economic burden for patients and caregivers, much of which is associated with initial surgery. The authors investigated the impact of insurance status on the inpatient hospital costs of surgery for patients with GBM. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective review of patients with GBM (2010-2015) undergoing their first resection at the University of California, San Francisco, and corresponding inpatient hospital costs. RESULTS: Of 227 patients with GBM (median age 62 years, 37.9% females), 31 (13.7%) had Medicaid, 94 (41.4%) had Medicare, and 102 (44.9%) had private insurance. Medicaid patients had 30% higher overall hospital costs for surgery compared to non-Medicaid patients ($50,285 vs $38,779, p = 0.01). Medicaid patients had higher intensive care unit (ICU; p < 0.01), operating room (p < 0.03), imaging (p < 0.001), room and board (p < 0001), and pharmacy (p < 0.02) costs versus non-Medicaid patients. Medicaid patients had significantly longer overall and ICU lengths of stay (6.9 and 2.6 days) versus Medicare (4.0 and 1.5 days) and privately insured patients (3.9 and 1.8 days, p < 0.01). Medicaid patients had similar comorbidity rates to Medicare patients (67.8% vs 68.1%), and both groups had higher comorbidity rates than privately insured patients (37.3%, p < 0.0001). Only 67.7% of Medicaid patients had primary care providers (PCPs) versus 91.5% of Medicare and 86.3% of privately insured patients (p = 0.009) at the time of presentation. Tumor diameter at diagnosis was largest for Medicaid (4.7 cm) versus Medicare (4.1 cm) and privately insured patients (4.2 cm, p = 0.03). Preoperative (70 vs 90, p = 0.02) and postoperative (80 vs 90, p = 0.03) Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) scores were lowest for Medicaid versus non-Medicaid patients, while in subgroup analysis, postoperative KPS score was lowest for Medicaid patients (80, vs 90 for Medicare and 90 for private insurance; p = 0.03). Medicaid patients had significantly shorter median overall survival (10.7 months vs 12.8 months for Medicare and 15.8 months for private insurance; p = 0.02). Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) scores were 0.66 and 1.05 for Medicaid and non-Medicaid patients, respectively (p = 0.036). The incremental cost per QALY was $29,963 lower for the non-Medicaid cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with GBMs and Medicaid have higher surgical costs, longer lengths of stay, poorer survival, and lower QALY scores. This study indicates that these patients lack PCPs, have more comorbidities, and present later in the disease course with larger tumors; these factors may drive the poorer postoperative function and greater consumption of hospital resources that were identified.

The World Health Organization has thus recommended early use of TXA in the treatment of PPH. This recommendation has not been universally adopted in the United States (US), in part because of concerns about cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: We aim to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of routine TXA administration in the treatment of PPH in the US, where the rate of hemorrhage-related mortality is lower than that described in the WOMAN trial. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a decision tree comparing three strategies in women with a clinical diagnosis of PPH: no TXA, TXA given at any time, and ideal use of TXA given within three hours of delivery. The study was performed from a health care institution perspective with a time horizon of delivery until 6 weeks post-partum. We included interventions that differed by arm in the WOMAN trial - hemorrhage-related mortality, laparotomies, and brace or compression sutures - and incorporated probabilities and costs based on available data for a population of women with PPH in the US. In our base case, the rate of PPH-related mortality was 0.0388%, and the cost of TXA was $37.80. We assumed that the relative risk reduction in death and laparotomy with TXA would be similar to the WOMAN trial (19% and 36%, respectively). The primary outcome was incremental cost per hemorrhage-related death averted, and a main secondary outcome was incremental cost per laparotomy avoided under each strategy. Another planned secondary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). We anticipated that the risk reduction (benefit) due to TXA in the US may be less than in the WOMAN trial; thus, we performed one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses to explore the parameter uncertainty across a wide range of data-supported estimates. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses with Monte Carlo simulation were performed. RESULTS: TXA strategies were dominant (more effective and cost-saving) compared to no TXA for patients with PPH in the US. One-way analyses showed that TXA is cost-saving as long as the relative risk reduction of death with TXA is greater than 4.7 percent; the model was not sensitive to any other variables. Threshold analyses outside of the bounds defined in the model showed that TXA is cost-saving as long as the relative risk reduction of laparotomy with TXA is greater than seven percent or the cost of TXA is less than $194. A two-way sensitivity analysis of the risk reduction of death due to TXA and the baseline risk of PPH-related death confirmed that TXA is cost-saving across a wide range of plausible estimates. Furthermore, probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the TXA strategies are cost-saving in >99.9% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Despite the initial cost of administration, the annual net cost savings expected from routine use of TXA for the treatment of PPH in the US is $11.3 million, and we estimate that nine maternal deaths would be averted in one year with this strategy. Giving TXA within three hours would almost triple the cost savings and improve maternal outcomes much further. CONCLUSION: A policy of routine TXA early in the treatment of PPH is likely to be cost-saving in the US.

20724,A cost-effectiveness model of genetic testing and periodical clinical screening for the evaluation of families with dilated cardiomyopathy,"PURPOSE: To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of cascade genetic testing in asymptomatic relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) compared with periodical clinical surveillance. METHODS: A decision-analytic model, combining a decision tree and a Markov model, was used to determine the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the two strategies. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the robustness of findings and to explore decision uncertainty. RESULTS: The incremental cost per additional QALY of cascade genetic testing prior to periodical clinical surveillance of first-degree relatives compared with periodical clinical surveillance alone was estimated at approximately AUD $6100. At established thresholds of cost-effectiveness, there is a 90% probability that cascade genetic testing is cost-effective. Extensive sensitivity analyses, including the addition of second-degree relatives, did not alter the conclusions drawn from the main analysis. CONCLUSION: Using cascade genetic testing to guide clinical surveillance of asymptomatic relatives of patients with DCM is very likely to be cost-effective. As the DCM pathogenic variant detection rate rises and new evidence for personalized treatment of at-risk individuals becomes available, the cost-effectiveness of cascade testing will further increase.",2019-01-29177,31222143,Genet Med,Max Catchpool,2019,/,,No,31222143,"Max Catchpool; Jay Ramchand; Melissa Martyn; David L Hare; Paul A James; Alison H Trainer; Josh Knight; Ilias Goranitis; A cost-effectiveness model of genetic testing and periodical clinical screening for the evaluation of families with dilated cardiomyopathy, Genet Med, 2019 Jun 20; ():1098-3600",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Screening,Genetic testing for first degree asymptomatic relatives of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Periodical clinical surveillance,First-degree relatives in probands with dilated cardiomyopathy,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,7500,Australia,2018,5777.99

Unlike these cost-effective analyses, where efficacy parameters were obtained from registration trials for drug approval, this analysis is a cost-effectiveness analysis of SOF+RBV for genotype (GT) 2 non-cirrhosis (NC) and compensated cirrhosis (CC) patients using efficacy parameters obtained from a multicentre cohort study (Kyushu University Liver Disease Study; KULDS) in Kyushu area in Japan in order to reflect real-world clinical practice in Japan. METHOD: A Markov model followed 10 000 patients (62 years old) over their lifetime. Four populations were followed: treatment-naive (TN)-NC, treatment-experienced (TE)-NC, TN-CC and TE-CC. Comparators were Peg-IFNalpha2b+RBV for TN-NC and CC patients and telaprevir (TVR)+Peg-IFNalpha2b+RBV for TE-NC patients.

20729,"Cataract surgery for falls prevention and improving vision: modelling the health gain, health system costs and cost-effectiveness in a high-income country","AIM: To estimate the health gain, health system costs and cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery when expedited as a falls prevention strategy (reducing the waiting time for surgery by 12 months) and as a routine procedure. METHODS: An established injurious falls model designed for the New Zealand (NZ) population (aged 65+ years) was adapted. Key parameters relating to cataracts were sourced from the literature and the NZ Ministry of Health. A health system perspective with discounting at 3% was used. RESULTS: Expedited cataract surgery for 1 year of incident cases was found to generate a total 240 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 161 to 360) at net health system costs of NZ$2.43 million (95% UI 2.02 to 2.82 million) over the remaining lifetimes of the surgery group. This intervention was cost-effective by widely accepted standards with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NZ$10 600 (US$7540) (95% UI NZ$6030 to NZ$15 700) per QALY gained. The level of cost-effectiveness did not vary greatly by sex, ethnicity and previous fall history, but was higher for the 65-69 age group compared with the oldest age group of 85-89 years (NZ$7000 vs NZ$14 200 per QALY gained). Comparing cataract surgery with no surgery, the ICER was even more favourable at NZ$4380 (95% UI 2410 to 7210) per QALY. Considering only the benefits for vision improvement and excluding the benefits of falls prevention, it was still favourable at NZ$9870 per QALY.

20730,Genomic surveillance of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: a mathematical early modelling study of cost effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Genomic surveillance of MRSA identifies unsuspected transmission events and outbreaks. Used proactively, this could direct early and highly targeted infection control interventions to prevent ongoing spread. Here, we evaluate the cost effectiveness of this intervention in a model that compared whole genome sequencing plus current practice versus current practice alone. METHODS: A UK cost-effectiveness study was conducted using an early model built from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services. Effectiveness of sequencing was based on the relative reduction in total MRSA acquisitions in a cohort of hospitalised patients in the year following their index admissions. Sensitivity analysis was used to illustrate and assess the level of confidence associated with the conclusions of our economic evaluation. RESULTS: A cohort of 65,000 patients were ran through the model. Assuming that sequencing would result in a 90% reduction in MRSA acquisition, 290 new MRSA cases were avoided. This gave an absolute reduction of 28.8% and avoidance of two MRSA-related deaths. Base case results indicated that the use of routine, proactive MRSA sequencing would be associated with estimated cost savings of over pound728,290 per annual hospitalised cohort. The impact in total QALYs was relatively modest, with sequencing leading to an additional 14.28 QALYs gained.

Weight loss due to gastric bypass (GBP) surgery improves clinical outcomes and may be a cost-effective intervention. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of GBP compared to clinical treatment in severely obese individuals with and without diabetes in the perspective of the Brazilian public health system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare costs and outcomes of gastric bypass in an open approach to clinical treatment. Health states were living with diabetes, remission of diabetes, non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction, and death. We also included the occurrence of complications related to surgery and plastic surgery after the gastric bypass surgery.

20738,Radiation Therapy without Endocrine Therapy for Women Age 70 or Above with Low-Risk Early Breast Cancer: A Microsimulation,"BACKGROUND: Endocrine therapy without radiation therapy is considered appropriate for women age 70 or above with low-risk hormone-positive breast cancer following partial mastectomy. However, some patients may prefer radiation without endocrine therapy, for which there is minimal modern data. We modeled the comparative efficacy of aromatase inhibition alone without radiation versus radiation alone without endocrine therapy. METHODS: We constructed a patient-level Markov model and compared 5-years of anastrozole to a 15-fraction course of radiation without boost or anastrozole. The relative effectiveness between treatments was based on the NSABP B-21 trial, which was further adjusted such that the endocrine alone arm matched the CALGB 9343 and PRIME II trials. Common or severe side-effects were considered. Eight survival metrics were assessed and validated against clinical trial data. The cost-efficacy of each strategy was considered using the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The model''s predicted outcomes matched those demonstrated by modern trials. Aromatase inhibitors were superior in preventing contralateral cancers, with a small impact on the risk of distant metastatic disease. Radiation was superior in preventing ipsilateral breast-tumor recurrence (IBTR) with a small impact on regional failure. No clinically significant differences were seen in the other four oncologic endpoints. Differences in QALYs were small, but radiation therapy was $3,809 more expensive over the average lifetime. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) suggested anastrozole was cost-effective in 62% of probabilistic simulations. However, the ICER was unstable due to a denominator that approached zero. CONCLUSION: Women age 70 or above with low-risk early breast cancer who are reluctant or unable to pursue adjuvant aromatase inhibition can safely pursue adjuvant radiation alone, with limited differences in outcome and a modest increase in costs.",2019-01-29208,31212043,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,Matthew C Ward,2019,/,,No,31212043,"Matthew C Ward; Frank Vicini; Manjeet Chadha; Lori Pierce; Abram Recht; James Hayman; Nikhil G Thaker; Atif Khan; Martin Keisch; Chirag Shah; Radiation Therapy without Endocrine Therapy for Women Age 70 or Above with Low-Risk Early Breast Cancer: A Microsimulation, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2019 Jun 15; ():0360-3016",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,Radiation therapy without anastrozole or boost vs. Standard/Usual Care- Aromatase inhibitor,Partial mastectormy recipient,Not Stated,70 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,210101,United States,2018,216546.93
20739,Treatment value of second-generation BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors compared with imatinib to achieve treatment-free remission in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia: a modelling study,"BACKGROUND: Treatment-free remission in chronic myeloid leukaemia-ie, achievement of a sustained deep molecular response leading to discontinuation of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy-has become a potential aim of therapy. Highly priced second-generation TKIs might offer deep molecular response status more quickly and for more patients than imatinib; however, with the availability and lower cost of generic imatinib, the value of second-generation TKIs as frontline therapy for this particular treatment endpoint remains unknown. We aimed to assess the potential value of second-generation TKIs used as frontline therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase in relation to the probability of achieving sustained deep molecular responses compared with generic imatinib, and the associated cost of each modality. METHODS: We used a decision analytic model to consider the value of different TKI approaches from the payer''s perspective. The proportion of patients achieving sustained deep molecular response after 5 years of treatment in chronic phase was estimated at 26% with imatinib and 44% with second-generation TKIs. We also modelled more favourable scenarios of the proportion of patients achieving such response with second-generation TKIs at 66%, 88%, and a near-perfect response of 99%. For each scenario, we examined the impact of the combination of health utilities for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (base case 0.89, range 0-1) and the annual cost of second-generation TKIs (base case US$152 814 [ie, the price of nilotinib in the USA], range 0-240 000) on the cost-effectiveness of second-generation TKIs compared with generic imatinib. We used different price scenarios for generic imatinib in the USA (average price $35 000 per year; lowest price $4400 per year), Europe ($4000 per year), and developing countries ($2100 per year). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and assessed cost-effectiveness by considering two societal willingness-to-pay thresholds: $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in all markets and $200 000 per QALY in the USA. FINDINGS: In the base case, we obtained an ICER of $22 765 208, meaning that second-generation TKIs as frontline therapy to achieve sustained deep molecular response was not cost-effective under either of the societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. In our sensitivity analyses, none of the explored scenarios showed potential treatment value for use of second-generation TKIs at the current prices in the USA or at the price of $30 000-40 000 per year elsewhere. For example, considering a scenario in the USA using second-generation TKIs versus imatinib (annual price $4400 per year) with the potential benefit in favour of second-generation TKI (willingness to pay $200 000 per QALY, 66% of patients achieving sustained deep molecular response, and health utility of the chronic phase of 0.1), the cost of second-generation TKIs would need to be less than $25 000 per year to be a cost-effective option. Under the same conditions in developing nations, with a price of generic imatinib of $2100 per year and a willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY, the annual price of second-generation TKIs should not exceed $10 000 per year of therapy. INTERPRETATION: Considering the current prices of second-generation TKIs and of generic imatinib under different pricing scenarios in the USA, Europe, and developing countries, second-generation TKIs at current prices do not offer good value as frontline therapy in chronic myeloid leukaemia in order to achieve sustained deep molecular response and treatment-free remission.

20742,Cost-effectiveness analysis of ceftazidime/avibactam compared to imipenem as empirical treatment for complicated urinary tract infections,"Ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is a novel, fixed-dose combination antibiotic that has been approved in Europe and the United States for patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs), based on results of a Phase III, randomized, comparative study (RECAPTURE study). The present analysis evaluated cost-effectiveness of CAZ-AVI as an empiric treatment for hospitalized patients with cUTIs from the Italian publicly funded healthcare (third-party payer) perspective. A sequential, patient-level simulation model that followed the clinical course of cUTI and generated pairs of identical 5,000 patients (CAZ-AVI or imipenem as empiric treatment) was developed. The model included additional impact of resistant pathogens; patients who did not respond to empiric treatment were switched to second-line treatment of colistin+high dose carbapenem in both groups. The time horizon of the model was five years with an annual discount rate of 3% applied to both costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The analysis demonstrated that intervention sequence (CAZ-AVI followed by colistin+high dose carbapenem) compared to comparator sequence (imipenem followed by colistin+high dose carbapenem) although at a net incremental cost of euro 1,015 per patient, provided better health outcomes in terms of clinical cure (97.65% versus 91.08%; =6.57%), shorter hospital stays (10.65 versus 12.55 days; =1.90 days), and QALYs gained per patient (4.190 versus 4.063; =0.126). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro 8,039/QALY which is well below the willingness-to-pay threshold of euro 30,000/QALY in Italy.

20743,Cost-Effectiveness of Cabozantinib in the Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Treatment options are limited for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that progresses after treatment with sorafenib. Cabozantinib, an oral small molecule inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors, recently showed improved overall survival (OS) compared with placebo in sorafenib-pretreated patients with advanced HCC in the CELESTIAL trial. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib for second-line treatment of patients with advanced HCC from a US healthcare system perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cost and utility data were extracted from the CELESTIAL trial and used to determine the cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib compared with placebo plus best supportive care. The main outcome of this study was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by using cabozantinib compared with placebo plus best supportive care in sorafenib-pretreated HCC. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis using data from the CELESTIAL trial, the incremental QALY and ICER were 0.067 and $1,040,675 for cabozantinib compared with placebo and best supportive care. OS reported in the CELESTIAL trial (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63-0.92) had the strongest association with the ICER. In one-way sensitivity analyses, there were no scenarios in which cabozantinib was cost-effective. In a cost-threshold analysis, cabozantinib would have to be priced at least $50 per pill to be cost-effective considering a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY. Although the CELESTIAL trial demonstrated that cabozantinib improves OS compared with placebo in patients with HCC that progresses after treatment with sorafenib, our analysis shows that cabozantinib is not a cost-effective therapy in this scenario.

20744,Cost effectiveness analysis of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) versus dalteparin for the treatment of cancer associated thrombosis (CAT) in the United States,"INTRODUCTION: While trials have demonstrated non-inferiority of direct oral anticoagulant drugs (DOAC) to low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) for the treatment of cancer associated thrombosis (CAT), it is unclear if the newer intervention is cost-effective. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis using a Markov state-transition model over a time horizon of 60months in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old patients with active malignancy and first acute symptomatic CAT who were eligible to receive either rivaroxaban/edoxaban or dalteparin. We obtained transition probability, relative risk, cost, and utility inputs from the literature. We estimated the differential impact on costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient and performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of results. RESULTS: Using the base-case analysis over 60months, DOAC versus dalteparin was associated with an incremental cost reduction of $24,129 with an incremental QALY reduction of 0.04. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the cost of dalteparin contributed the most to the incremental cost difference; relative risk of death related to underlying cancer contributed the most of the incremental QALY difference. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the base-case analysis, with a large reduction in cost but small reduction in QALYs. CONCLUSION: Rivaroxaban or edoxaban as compared to dalteparin is cost saving from a payer''s perspective for the treatment of CAT. Professional organizations and healthcare systems may want to consider this analysis in future practice recommendations.",2019-01-29239,31200341,Thromb Res,Ang Li,2019,180 /,37-42,No,31200341,"Ang Li; Poorni M Manohar; David A Garcia; Gary H Lyman; Lotte M Steuten; Cost effectiveness analysis of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) versus dalteparin for the treatment of cancer associated thrombosis (CAT) in the United States, Thromb Res, 2019 May 16; 180():1879-2472; 37-42",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Direct oral anticoagulant drugs vs. Standard/Usual Care- Dalteparin,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"60 Months, 12 months",3.00,3.00,623459,United States,2018,642586.81

One of concerns over its application is pertaining to cost-effectiveness analysis(CEA) from population average and specific subgroup differences for such a therapy is imperative for health decision-maker to allocate limited resources. However, this sort of CEA model considering heterogeneous population with risk factors adjustment has been rarely addressed. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to show the heterogeneity of CEA in immunotherapy for AD in comparison with the comparator without intervention. Economic evaluation was performed via incremental cost-effectiveness ratio(ICER) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve(CEAC) in terms of the quality-adjusted life years(QALY).

A Helicobacter pylori antibody test and eradication (H. pylori screening) reduces gastric cancer risk. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of H. pylori screening, compared to UGI and endoscopy in high prevalence countries. Methods: We developed decision trees with Markov models using a healthcare payer perspective and a lifetime horizon. Targeted populations were hypothetical cohorts of asymptomatic individuals at the age of 50, 60, 70 and 80 years. We calculated per-person costs and effectiveness with discounting at a fixed annual rate of 3% and compared incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results: H. pylori screening was cost-saving and more cost-effective for individuals at the age of 50, 60, 70, and 80 than UGI and endoscopy. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses using Monte-Carlo simulation for 10,000 trials demonstrated that H. pylori screening was cost-effective 100% of the time at a willingness-to-pay level of US$50,000/QALY gained. Conclusions: H. pylori screening for the adults 50 years of age and older could be cost-effective compared to UGI and endoscopy in high prevalence countries.

20760,Health and Economic Impact of Intensive Surveillance for Distant Recurrence After Curative Treatment of Colon Cancer: A Mathematical Modeling Study,"BACKGROUND: Intensive surveillance strategies are currently recommended for patients after curative treatment of colon cancer, with the aim of secondary prevention of recurrence. Yet, intensive surveillance has not yielded improvements in overall patient survival compared with minimal follow-up, and more intensive surveillance may be costlier. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate the quality-adjusted life-years, economic costs, and cost-effectiveness of various surveillance strategies after curative treatment of colon cancer. DESIGN: A Markov model was calibrated to reflect the natural history of colon cancer recurrence and used to estimate surveillance costs and outcomes. SETTINGS: This was a decision-analytic model. PATIENTS: Individuals entered the model at age 60 years after curative treatment for stage I, II, or III colon cancer. Other initial age groups were assessed in secondary analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated the gains in quality-adjusted life-years achieved by early detection and treatment of recurrence, as well as the economic costs of surveillance under various strategies. RESULTS: Cost-effective strategies for patients with stage I colon cancer improved quality-adjusted life-expectancy by 0.02 to 0.06 quality-adjusted life-years at an incremental cost of $1702 to $13,019. For stage II, they improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.03 to 0.09 quality-adjusted life-years at a cost of $2300 to $14,363. For stage III, they improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.03 to 0.17 quality-adjusted life-years for a cost of $1416 to $17,631. At a commonly cited willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the most cost-effective strategy for patients with a history of stage I or II colon cancer was liver ultrasound and chest x-ray annually. For those with a history of stage III colon cancer, the optimal strategy was liver ultrasound and chest x-ray every 6 months with CEA measurement every 6 months. LIMITATIONS: The study was limited by model structure assumptions and uncertainty around the values of the model''s parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Given currently available data and within the limitations of a model-based decision-analytic approach, the effectiveness of routine intensive surveillance for patients after treatment of colon cancer appears, on average, to be small. Compared with testing using lower cost imaging, currently recommended strategies are associated with cost-effectiveness ratios that indicate low value according to well-accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the United States.

20763,"Cost-effectiveness of option B+ in prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Yunnan Province, China","BACKGROUND: Although Option B+ may be more costly than Options B, it may provide additional health benefits that are currently unclear in Yunnan province. We created deterministic models to estimate the cost-effectiveness of Option B+. METHODS: Data were used in two deterministic models simulating a cohort of 2000 HIV+ pregnant women. A decision tree model simulated the number of averted infants infections and QALY acquired for infants in the PMTCT period for Options B and B+. The minimum cost was calculated. A Markov decision model simulated the number of maternal life year gained and serodiscordant partner infections averted in the ten years after PMTCT for Option B or B+. ICER per life year gained was calculated. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: If fully implemented, Option B and Option B+ averted 1016.85 infections and acquired 588,01.02 QALYs.The cost of Option B was US$1,229,338.47, the cost of Option B+ was 1,176,128.63. However, when Options B and B+ were compared over ten years, Option B+ not only improved mothers''ten-year survival from 69.7 to 89.2%, saving more than 3890 life-years, but also averted 3068 HIV infections between serodiscordant partners. Option B+ yielded a favourable ICER of $32.99per QALY acquired in infants and $5149per life year gained in mothers. A 1% MTCT rate, a 90% coverage rate and a 20-year horizon could decrease the ICER per QALY acquired in children and LY gained in mothers. CONCLUSIONS: Option B+ is a cost-effective treatment for comprehensive HIV prevention for infants and serodiscordant partners and life-long treatment for mothers in Yunnan province, China.

METHODS: We developed a stochastic simulation model of CD patients on IFX and evaluated the expected health costs and outcomes of a proactive TDM strategy compared with a reactive strategy. The proactive strategy measured IFX concentration and antibody status every 6 months, or at the time of a flare, and dosed IFX to a therapeutic window. The reactive strategy only did so at the time of a flare. RESULTS: The proactive strategy led to fewer flares than the reactive strategy. More patients stayed on IFX in the proactive vs reactive strategy (63.4% vs 58.8% at year 5). From a health sector perspective, a proactive strategy was marginally cost-effective compared with a reactive strategy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $146,494 per quality-adjusted life year), assuming a 40% of the wholesale price of IFX. The results were most sensitive to risk of flaring with a low IFX concentration and the cost of IFX. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming 40% of the average wholesale acquisition cost of biologic therapies, proactive TDM for IFX is marginally cost-effective compared with a reactive TDM strategy.

20767,Cost-effectiveness analysis of gemcitabine plus cisplatin versus fluorouracil plus cisplatin for first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"PURPOSE: Compared with conventional fluorouracil plus cisplatin (FP) regimen, gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GP) can prolong survival in patients with recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but the economic impact of this practice remains unknown. It''s significant to evaluate its values by taking both efficacy and cost into consideration. METHODS: We developed a Markov model with 10years horizon to compare the cost-effectiveness of GP and FP regimen. Clinical data came from a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial. Direct costs related to the treatment were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. Utility values were gathered from published study. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to confirm the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The total cost of FP regimen was $12,587 and yielded 0.964 QALYs, while the total cost of GP regimen was $17,920 and yielded 1.685 QALYs. The ICER of GP regimen versus FP regimen was $7,386 which was far less than the willingness-to-pay threshold ($26,508) in China. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of Chinese healthcare system, GP regimen with superior efficacy was proved to be more cost-effective than the traditional FP regimen.

20768,Modeling the cost effectiveness and budgetary impact of Polypills for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in the United States,"BACKGROUND: There is underutilization of appropriate medications for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). METHODS: Usual care (UC) was compared to polypill-based care with 3 versions using a validated micro-simulation model in the NHANES population with prior CVD. UC included individual prescription of up to 4 drug classes (antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors and statins). The polypills modeled were aspirin 81 mg, atenolol 50 mg, ramipril 5 mg, and either simvastatin 40 mg (Polypill I), atorvastatin 80 mg (Polypill II), or rosuvastatin 40 mg (Polypill III). Baseline medication use and adherence came from United Healthcare claims data. RESULTS: When compared to UC, there were annual reductions of 130,000 to 178,000 myocardial infarctions and 54,000 to 74,000 strokes using Polypill I and II, respectively. From a health sector perspective, in incremental analysis the ICERs for Polypill I and II were $20,073/QALY and $21,818/QALY respectively; Polypill III was dominated but had a similar cost-effectiveness ratio to Polypill II when compared directly to usual care. From a societal perspective, Polypill II was cost-saving and dominated all strategies. Over a 5-year period, those taking Polypill I and II compared to UC saved approximately $12 and $6 per-patient-per-year alive, respectively. Polypill II was the preferred strategy in 98% of runs at a willingness to pay of $50,000 in the probability sensitivity analysis.

20771,Cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of HCV treatment with direct-acting antivirals in India including the risk of reinfection,"BACKGROUND: HCV direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) are produced in India at low cost. However, concerns surrounding reinfection and budgetary impact limit treatment scale-up in India. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of HCV treatment in India, including reinfection. METHODS: A closed cohort Markov model of HCV disease progression, treatment, and reinfection was parameterized. We compared treatment by fibrosis stage (F2-F4 or F0-F4) to no treatment from a health care payer perspective. Costs (2017 USD$, based on India-specific data) and health utilities (in quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were attached to each health state. We assumed DAAs with 90% sustained viral response at $900/treatment and 1%/year reinfection, varied in the sensitivity analysis from 0.1-15%. We deemed the intervention cost-effective if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) fell below India''s per capita GDP ($1,709). We assessed the budgetary impact of treating all diagnosed individuals. RESULTS: HCV treatment for diagnosed F2-F4 individuals was cost-saving (net costs -$2,881 and net QALYs 3.18/person treated; negative ICER) compared to no treatment. HCV treatment remained cost-saving with reinfection rates of 15%/year. Treating all diagnosed individuals was likely cost-effective compared to delay until F2 (mean ICER $1,586/QALY gained, 67% of simulations falling under the $1,709 threshold) with 1%/year reinfection. For all scenarios, annual retesting for reinfection was more cost-effective than the current policy (one-time retest). Treating all diagnosed individuals and reinfections results in net costs of $445-1,334 million over 5 years (<0.25% of total health care expenditure over 5 years), and cost-savings within 14 years. CONCLUSIONS: HCV treatment was highly cost-effective in India, despite reinfection. Annual retesting for reinfection was cost-effective, supporting a policy change towards more frequent retesting.

20772,The Management of Type 2 Diabetes with Once-Weekly Semaglutide Versus Dulaglutide: A Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in Slovakia,"INTRODUCTION: Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists represent a class of treatments for type 2 diabetes that offer multifactorial benefits, including glycemic control, weight loss and low hypoglycemia risk. Once-weekly semaglutide is a novel GLP-1 analog that has been associated with improved glycemic control and reduced body mass index (BMI) versus once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist dulaglutide in SUSTAIN 7, which is reimbursed in patients with a BMI > 35 kg/m(2) in Slovakia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg in Slovakia. METHODS: Clinical and cost outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were based on the sub-group of patients with a BMI > 35 kg/m(2) in SUSTAIN 7. Patients were modeled to receive once-weekly semaglutide or dulaglutide for 3 years, after which treatment was intensified to basal insulin. Treatment effects associated with once-weekly semaglutide and dulaglutide were maintained for the first 3 years before HbA1c increased to 7.0% and BMI reverted to baseline. Costs were accounted from a healthcare payer perspective in Slovakia and expressed in euros (EUR). Utilities relating to quality of life were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.04 and 0.07 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Lifetime medical costs were similar, with cost savings of EUR 20 and EUR 140 per patient with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg, respectively, versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Both doses of once-weekly semaglutide were therefore considered dominant versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg. CONCLUSION: Both doses of once-weekly semaglutide represent cost-saving treatment options versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg for obese patients with type 2 diabetes in Slovakia.

20774,"Cost Effectiveness of the Third-Generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Ponatinib, vs. Second-Generation TKIs or Stem Cell Transplant, as Third-Line Treatment for Chronic-Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Third-line treatment options for patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia include tyrosine kinase inhibitors and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT). The objective of this study was to develop a Markov model with a lifetime time horizon to assess the cost effectiveness of ponatinib for third-line chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) or alloHSCT from the public healthcare system perspective in Germany, Sweden, and Canada. METHODS: Clinical outcomes were derived from the literature, and from patient-level data (phase II PACE trial) for ponatinib. Resource use included drugs, alloHSCT, monitoring and follow-up, adverse events, and end-of-life care; costs were based on national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using chronic myeloid leukemia health-state utilities from an international time-trade-off study. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum for Germany and Sweden, and 5% for Canada. RESULTS: Ponatinib yielded more discounted QALYs than any second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor/alloHSCT in all three countries, mainly owing to better response rates and longer durations of response. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors were US$21,543-37,755/QALY in Germany, $24,018-38,227/QALY in Sweden, and $43,001-58,515/QALY in Canada. Ponatinib was dominant over alloHSCT in Germany, while incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. alloHSCT in Sweden and Canada were $715/QALY and $31,534/QALY, respectively.

Resource use included drugs, alloHSCT, monitoring and follow-up, adverse events, and end-of-life care; costs were based on national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using chronic myeloid leukemia health-state utilities from an international time-trade-off study. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum for Germany and Sweden, and 5% for Canada. RESULTS: Ponatinib yielded more discounted QALYs than any second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor/alloHSCT in all three countries, mainly owing to better response rates and longer durations of response. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors were US$21,543-37,755/QALY in Germany, $24,018-38,227/QALY in Sweden, and $43,001-58,515/QALY in Canada. Ponatinib was dominant over alloHSCT in Germany, while incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. alloHSCT in Sweden and Canada were $715/QALY and $31,534/QALY, respectively.

20786,Short-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Switching to Insulin Degludec in Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Receiving Basal-Bolus Therapy,"INTRODUCTION: With one of the fastest aging populations in the world, demographic changes in Japan are a major public health concern due to the substantial burden that aging-associated diseases, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), place on public healthcare systems. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the short-term cost-effectiveness of switching Japanese patients with T2D receiving basal-bolus insulin therapy from their previous basal insulin to insulin degludec (degludec) under conditions of routine clinical practice. METHODS: A previously published, open-source model developed in Microsoft Excel was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of switching basal-bolus insulin therapy from patients'' previous basal insulin to degludec versus continuing the previous basal insulin therapeutic regimen in terms of costs (2018 Japanese Yen [JPY]) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), from a Japanese public healthcare payer perspective. The model captured hypoglycemia rates and insulin dosing over a 1-year time horizon, and was informed by Japanese real-world evidence from the T2D cohort (N = 135) of the Kumamoto Insulin Degludec Observational study. RESULTS: Treatment with degludec was associated with improved effectiveness (+ 0.0354 QALYs), driven by lower daytime non-severe hypoglycemia rates with degludec, at slightly higher annual treatment costs (JPY 9510) versus continuing the previous basal insulin. Switching basal insulin to degludec was found to be a cost-effective intervention with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (JPY 268,811 per QALY gained) substantially below the willingness-to-pay threshold of 5 million JPY per QALY used in the Japanese Health Technology Assessment framework. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of this finding and indicated that the daytime non-severe hypoglycemia benefit with degludec was a key driver of outcomes in the base case. CONCLUSION: Based on Japanese real-world evidence, our analysis suggests that switching Japanese patients with T2D receiving a basal-bolus regimen from their previous basal insulin to degludec would be highly cost-effective. These data may help decision-makers in Japan allocate healthcare resources efficiently.

20787,Cost-effectiveness of different treat-to-target strategies in rheumatoid arthritis: results from the DREAM registry,"Background: Adjusting medication of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) until predefined disease activity targets are met, i.e. Treat-to-Target (T2T), is the currently recommended treatment approach. However, not much is known about long-term cost-effectiveness of different T2T strategies.We model the 5-year costs and effects of a step-up approach (MTX mono - > MTX + csDMARD combination - > Adalimumab - > second anti-TNF) and an initial combination therapy approach (MTX + csDMARD - > MTX + csDMARD higher dose - > anti-TNFs) from the healthcare and societal perspectives, by adapting a previously validated Markov model. Methods: We constructed a Markov model in which 3-monthly transitions between DAS28-defined health states of remission (</=2.6), low (2.6 < DAS28 </= 3.2), moderate (3.2 < DAS28 </= 5.1), and high disease activity (DAS28 > 5.1) were simulated. Modelled patients proceeded to subsequent treatments in case of non-remission at each (3-month) cycle start. In case of remission for two consecutive cycles medication was tapered, until medication-free remission was achieved. Transition probabilities for individual treatment steps were estimated using data of Dutch Rheumatology Monitoring registry Remission Induction Cohort I (step-up) and II (initial combination). Expected costs, utility, and ICER after 5 years were compared between the two strategies. To account for parameter uncertainty, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed through Gamma, Normal, and Dirichlet distributions. All utilities, costs, and transition probabilities were replaced by fitted distributions. Results: Over a 5-year timespan, initial combination therapy was less costly and more effective than step-up therapy. Initial combination therapy accrued euro16,226.3 and 3.552 QALY vs euro20,183.3 and 3.517 QALYs for step-up therapy. This resulted in a negative ICER, indicating that initial combination therapy was both less costly and more effective in terms of utility gained. This can be explained by higher (+/-5%) remission percentages in initial combination strategy at all time points. More patients in remission generates less healthcare and productivity loss costs and higher utility. Additionally, higher remission percentages caused less bDMARD use in the initial combination strategy, lowering overall costs. Conclusion: Initial combination therapy was found favourable over step-up therapy in the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis, when considering cost-effectiveness. Initial combination therapy resulted in more utility at a lower cost over 5 years.",2019-01-29319,31168521,BMC Rheumatol,Celine J van de Laar,2019,3 /,16,No,31168521,"Celine J van de Laar; Martijn A H Oude Voshaar; Harald E Vonkeman; Cost-effectiveness of different treat-to-target strategies in rheumatoid arthritis: results from the DREAM registry, BMC Rheumatol, 2019; 3():2520-1026; 16",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Step-up therapy vs. Methotrexate and conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug combination followed by high dose of Methotrexate and conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug combination followed by anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,4.00,1.50,-102737.5,Euro,2016,-122592.18

We investigated the cost-effectiveness of this regimen. METHODS: A Markov-based microsimulation model with six health states is used to simulate four adjuvant therapy options for women with early-stage node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer at different age groups. The four treatment arms are 1) adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab (TH), 2) doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel and trastuzumab (ACTH), 3) docetaxel, carboplatin and trastuzumab (TCH), and 4) no adjuvant trastuzumab (NT).

20793,Updated Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Evolocumab in Patients With Very High-risk Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease,"Importance: In October 2018, evolocumab was made available at a reduced annual list price of $5850 in the United States. This 60% reduction was aimed at improving patient access by lowering patient copays. Shortly thereafter, the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association cholesterol management guideline was released. An updated cost-effectiveness analysis of evolocumab in the United States may be therefore of interest to payers and prescribers. Objective: To present an updated cost-effectiveness analysis of evolocumab added to standard background therapy compared with standard background therapy alone in patients with very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, reflecting the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline definition and using the new evolocumab list price. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study used the Markov model originally used in a previous study by Fonarow et al in 2017. A US societal perspective was considered, and a range of baseline cardiovascular event rates were modeled to reflect varying risk profiles in clinical practice within patients with very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Exposures: Addition of evolocumab to standard background therapy, including maximally tolerated statin therapy (ie, the maximum intensity of statin therapy a patient can safely receive), with or without ezetimibe. Main Outcomes and Measures: Major cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular death), costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results: Evolocumab was associated with both increased costs and improved outcomes when added to standard background therapy. Incremental costs ranged from $22228 to $3411, depending on the varying level of risk within the defined population. Incremental quality-adjusted life years ranged from 0.39 to 0.44. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $56655 to $7667 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. For a range of baseline cardiovascular event rates in patients with very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below the generally accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds. Moreover, the ratios were below the threshold of $50000 per quality-adjusted life-years gained for any baseline rate of 6.9 or more events per 100 patient-years. Conclusions and Relevance: At its current list price, the addition of evolocumab to standard background therapy meets accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds across a range of baseline cardiovascular event rates in patients with very high-risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease as defined by the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline.",2019-01-29325,31166576,JAMA Cardiol,Gregg C Fonarow,2019,/,,No,31166576,"Gregg C Fonarow; Ben van Hout; Guillermo Villa; Jorge Arellano; Peter Lindgren; Updated Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Evolocumab in Patients With Very High-risk Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, JAMA Cardiol, 2019 Jun 5; ():2380-6591",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Maximally tolerated statin therapy and evolocumab vs. Maximally tolerated statin therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,56655,United States,2018,58393.18
20794,Cost-effectiveness of rituximab versus azathioprine for maintenance treatment in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis,"OBJECTIVES: Rituximab was proven superior to azathioprine for maintenance treatment of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). The high cost of rituximab might, however, limit its routine use. This study determined the cost-effectiveness of intravenous rituximab (5 x 500 mg until month 18), versus oral azathioprine (2 mg/kg per day, gradually decreased between month 12 and 22), for maintenance treatment of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, or renal-limited vasculitis, aged 18-75. METHODS: We performed a single-trial based economic evaluation. MAINRITSAN was a 28-month multicentre, prospective, randomised, controlled open-label trial. We estimated the cost of healthcare resources and quality of life using prospectively collected data. Healthcare costs were estimated from the perspective of the French Social Health Insurance''s perspective, using 2016 tariffs for reimbursement. Utilities were derived from Short Form 36 scores. We estimated total average cost, incremental cost per incremental relapse averted and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainty over relapses, severe adverse events, discount rate, utility weights, time horizon and the cost of rituximab. Costs drivers were tested using a generalised linear model. RESULTS: Total average costs were euro13,387 (euro11,605-euro15,646) and euro10,217 (euro7,567-12,949) in the rituximab and azathioprine groups respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was euro12,824 per relapse averted and the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) euro37,782 per QALY gained. Besides the unit cost of rituximab, the major cost drivers were relapses and severe adverse events.

20798,Cost-effectiveness of screening for HLA-B*1502 prior to initiation of carbamazepine in epilepsy patients of Asian ancestry in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: Carbamazepine, widely used in the treatment of partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, has been associated with life-threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis among some Asians. The HLA-B*1502 genotype that occurs with varying frequency among Asians is recommended for screening prior to starting carbamazepine. Our goal is to explore the cost-effectiveness of screening for the presence of this genetic allele. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model in a hypothetical cohort of adult Asian patients with epilepsy in the United States being considered for carbamazepine to investigate the cost-effectiveness of two alternative strategies: (1) no HLA-B*1502 gene allele screening and using carbamazepine and (2) HLA-B*1502 gene allele screening and starting levetiracetam in the case of a positive screen. RESULTS: For the lifetime horizon, HLA-B*1502 gene screening was the cost-effective choice compared to no gene screening, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $27 058 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), below the $50 000/QALY threshold in 99.69% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Although gene screening strategy was more expensive than a no screening strategy, it was more effective, yielding more QALYs, across all Asian ethnic groups. SIGNIFICANCE: Our analysis confirms the 2007 US Food and Drug Administration recommendation to screen for HLA-B*1502 allele before starting treatment with carbamazepine in patients of Asian ancestry in the United States.",2019-01-29349,31158306,Epilepsia,Hyunmi Choi,2019,60 / 7,1472-1481,No,31158306,"Hyunmi Choi; Babak Mohit; Cost-effectiveness of screening for HLA-B*1502 prior to initiation of carbamazepine in epilepsy patients of Asian ancestry in the United States, Epilepsia, 2019 Jul; 60(7):0013-9580; 1472-1481",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,Epilepsy screening vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,27058,United States,2016,29177.93
