22601,Cost-Effectiveness of Sensor-Augmented Insulin Pump Therapy Versus Continuous Insulin Infusion in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes in Turkey,"Background and Aims: Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) combines continuous glucose monitoring with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). SAP is costlier than CSII but provides additional clinical benefits relative to CSII alone. A long-term cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to determine whether SAP is cost-effective relative to CSII in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Turkey. Methods: Analyses were performed in two different patient cohorts, one with poor glycemic control at baseline (mean glycated hemoglobin 9.0% [75 mmol/mol]) and a second cohort considered to be at increased risk of hypoglycemic events. Clinical input data and direct medical costs were sourced from published literature. The analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective over patient lifetimes and future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: In both patient cohorts, SAP was associated with a gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy but higher costs relative to CSII (incremental gain of 1.40 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] in patients with poor baseline glycemic control and 1.73 QALYs in patients at increased risk of hypoglycemic events). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for SAP versus CSII were TRY 76,971 (EUR 11,612) per QALY gained for patients with poor baseline glycemic control and TRY 69,534 (EUR 10,490) per QALY gained for patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia. Conclusions: SAP is associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes versus CSII, and in Turkey, SAP is likely to represent good value for money compared with CSII in T1D patients with poor glycemic control and/or with frequent severe hypoglycemic events.",2019-01-31941,31509715,Diabetes Technol Ther,Stephane Roze,2019,21 / 12,727-735,No,31509715,"Stephane Roze; Aysegul Erman; William W L Wong; Jordan J Feld; Paul Grootendorst; Murray D Krahn; Cost-Effectiveness of Sensor-Augmented Insulin Pump Therapy Versus Continuous Insulin Infusion in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes in Turkey, Diabetes Technol Ther , 2019 Dec; 21(12):1557-8593; 727-735",QALY,Turkey,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Device, Pharmaceutical",sensor-augmented pump therapy + continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs. continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion,Increased risk for hypoglycemia cohort,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,69534,Turkey,2016,24801.78
22602,Long-term Outcomes and Cost-effectiveness of Breast Cancer Screening with Digital Breast Tomosynthesis in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is increasingly being used for routine breast cancer screening. We projected the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of DBT compared to conventional digital mammography (DM) for breast cancer screening in the United States. METHODS: Three Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) breast cancer models simulated U.S. women aged >/=40 years undergoing breast cancer screening with either DBT or DM starting in 2011 and continuing for the lifetime of the cohort. Screening performance estimates were based on observational data; in an alternative scenario we assumed 4% higher sensitivity for DBT. Analyses used federal payer perspective; costs and utilities were discounted at 3% annually. Outcomes included breast cancer deaths, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), false-positive examinations, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Compared to DM, DBT screening resulted in a slight reduction in breast cancer deaths (range across models 0-0.21/1,000 women), small increase in QALYs (1.97-3.27/1,000 women) and a 24-28% reduction in false-positive exams (237-268/1,000 women) relative to DM. ICERs ranged from $195,026-$270,135/QALY for DBT relative to DM. When assuming 4% higher DBT sensitivity, ICERs decreased to $130,533-$156,624/QALY. ICERs were sensitive to DBT costs, decreasing to $78,731-$168,883 and $52,918-$118,048 when the additional cost of DBT was reduced to $36 and $26 (from baseline of $56), respectively. CONCLUSION: DBT reduces false-positive exams while achieving similar or slightly improved health benefits. At current reimbursement rates, the additional costs of DBT screening are likely high relative to the benefits gained; however, DBT could be cost-effective at lower screening costs.",2019-01-31950,31503283,J Natl Cancer Inst,Kathryn P Lowry,2019,/,,No,31503283,"Kathryn P Lowry; Rita Del Pinto; Jackson T Wright; Annalisa Monaco; Davide Pietropaoli; Claudio Ferri; Long-term Outcomes and Cost-effectiveness of Breast Cancer Screening with Digital Breast Tomosynthesis in the United States, J Natl Cancer Inst, 2019 Jun 12; ():0027-8874",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,digital breast tomosynthesis vs. Standard/Usual Care- digital mammography,Not Stated,80 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,215000,United States,2018,221596.23

22605,Potential cost-effectiveness of wearable cardioverter-defibrillator for patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator explant in a high-income city of China,"INTRODUCTION: Wearable cardioverter-defibrillator (WCD) is recommended for patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) removal. This study aimed to investigate the potential cost-effectiveness of WCD for patients with ICD explant in a high-income city of China. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 5-year decision-analytic model was developed to simulate outcomes of three strategies during the period between ICD explant and reimplantation: discharge-to-home without WCD (home group), discharge-to-home with WCD (WCD group), and stay-in-hospital (hospital group). Outcome measures were mortality rates (during the period between ICD explant and reimplantation), direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER). Model inputs were derived from literature and public data. Base-case analysis was performed at four cost levels of WCD. Robustness of model results was examined by sensitivity analyses. In base-case analysis, the 8-week mortality rates of WCD, hospital, and home groups were 7.3%, 8.1%, and 9.4%, respectively. WCD group gained the highest QALYs (3.0990 QALYs), followed by hospital group (3.0553 QALYs) and home group (3.0132 QALYs). The WCD group was the cost-effective option with ICERs less than willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (57 315 USD/QALY) at WCD daily cost </=USD48. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the WCD group at daily cost of USD24, USD48, USD72, and USD96 were cost-effective in 100%, 94.16%, 22.08%, and 0.16% of 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations, respectively.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A 5-year decision-analytic model was developed to simulate outcomes of three strategies during the period between ICD explant and reimplantation: discharge-to-home without WCD (home group), discharge-to-home with WCD (WCD group), and stay-in-hospital (hospital group). Outcome measures were mortality rates (during the period between ICD explant and reimplantation), direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY saved (ICER). Model inputs were derived from literature and public data. Base-case analysis was performed at four cost levels of WCD. Robustness of model results was examined by sensitivity analyses. In base-case analysis, the 8-week mortality rates of WCD, hospital, and home groups were 7.3%, 8.1%, and 9.4%, respectively. WCD group gained the highest QALYs (3.0990 QALYs), followed by hospital group (3.0553 QALYs) and home group (3.0132 QALYs). The WCD group was the cost-effective option with ICERs less than willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (57 315 USD/QALY) at WCD daily cost </=USD48. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the WCD group at daily cost of USD24, USD48, USD72, and USD96 were cost-effective in 100%, 94.16%, 22.08%, and 0.16% of 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Use of WCD during the period between ICD explant and reimplantation is likely to save life and gain higher QALYs.

22621,The Fear Reduction Exercised Early (FREE) approach to management of low back pain in general practice: A pragmatic cluster-randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Effective and cost-effective primary care treatments for low back pain (LBP) are required to reduce the burden of the world''s most disabling condition. This study aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Fear Reduction Exercised Early (FREE) approach to LBP (intervention) with usual general practitioner (GP) care (control). METHODS AND FINDINGS: This pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial with process evaluation and parallel economic evaluation was conducted in the Hutt Valley, New Zealand. Eight general practices were randomly assigned (stratified by practice size) with a 1:1 ratio to intervention (4 practices; 34 GPs) or control group (4 practices; 29 GPs). Adults presenting to these GPs with LBP as their primary complaint were recruited. GPs in the intervention practices were trained in the FREE approach, and patients presenting to these practices received care based on the FREE approach. The FREE approach restructures LBP consultations to prioritise early identification and management of barriers to recovery. GPs in control practices did not receive specific training for this study, and patients presenting to these practices received usual care. Between 23 September 2016 and 31 July 2017, 140 eligible patients presented to intervention practices (126 enrolled) and 110 eligible patients presented to control practices (100 enrolled). Patient mean age was 46.1 years (SD 14.4), and 46% were female. The duration of LBP was less than 6 weeks in 88% of patients. Primary outcome was change from baseline in patient participant Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) score at 6 months. Secondary patient outcomes included pain, satisfaction, and psychosocial indices. GP outcomes included attitudes, knowledge, confidence, and GP LBP management behaviour. There was active and passive surveillance of potential harms. Patients and outcome assessors were blind to group assignment. Analysis followed intention-to-treat principles. A total of 122 (97%) patients from 32 GPs in the intervention group and 99 (99%) patients from 25 GPs in the control group were included in the primary outcome analysis. At 6 months, the groups did not significantly differ on the primary outcome (adjusted mean RMDQ score difference 0.57, 95% CI -0.64 to 1.78; p = 0.354) or secondary patient outcomes. The RMDQ difference met the predefined criterion to indicate noninferiority. One control group participant experienced an activity-related gluteal tear, with no other adverse events recorded. Intervention group GPs had improvements in attitudes, knowledge, and confidence compared with control group GPs. Intervention group GP LBP management behaviour became more guideline concordant than the control group. In cost-effectiveness, the intervention dominated control with lower costs and higher Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gains. Limitations of this study were that although adequately powered for primary outcome assessment, the study was not powered for evaluating some employment, healthcare use, and economic outcomes. It was also not possible for research nurses (responsible for patient recruitment) to be masked on group allocation for practices. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that the FREE approach improves GP concordance with LBP guideline recommendations but does not improve patient recovery outcomes compared with usual care. The FREE approach may reduce unnecessary healthcare use and produce economic benefits. Work participation or health resource use should be considered for primary outcome assessment in future trials of undifferentiated LBP.

22624,Cost effectiveness of interventions to improve adherence to statin therapy in ASCVD patients in the United States,"Introduction: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, and high cholesterol is a leading risk factor for CVD. While statins are effective at reducing cholesterol, they are frequently underused in patients at highest risk of CVD. The objective of this study was to identify interventions which may improve adherence to statins and to assess their cost effectiveness within the US Medicare population. Methods: A literature review was undertaken to identify interventions to improve adherence in patients with CVD at highest risk of a recurrent event and to quantify non-adherence and the consequences of non-adherence to statins in this population. A Markov cost-utility model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of these interventions. Results: Ten adherence interventions were identified in the literature, with 6 demonstrating statistically significant improvement in adherence. The six interventions were disease management, interactive voice response, nurse counselling, discharge letter, nurse/dietician counselling and electronic pill bottle with feedback. The model found the cost effectiveness of an intervention was highly dependent on its effectiveness and costs. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios ranged from $27,545/QALY for discharge letter with large adherence gain to $130,399/QALY for disease management program with small adherence gain.

The landscape for the treatment of CDI is evolving. AIM: To elucidate the most cost-effective strategy for managing recurrent CDI. METHODS: A decision tree analysis was created from a modified third-party payer''s perspective to compare the cost-effectiveness of five strategies for patients experiencing their first CDI recurrence: oral vancomycin, fidaxomicin, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) via colonoscopy, FMT via oral capsules, and a one-time infusion of bezlotoxumab with vancomycin. Effectiveness measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALY). A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 per QALY was set. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed that FMT via colonoscopy was associated with the lowest cost at $5250 and that FMT via capsules was also a cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $31205/QALY. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that FMT delivered by oral capsules and colonoscopy was comparable cost-effective modalities. At its current cost and effectiveness, bezlotoxumab was not a cost-effective strategy.

The landscape for the treatment of CDI is evolving. AIM: To elucidate the most cost-effective strategy for managing recurrent CDI. METHODS: A decision tree analysis was created from a modified third-party payer''s perspective to compare the cost-effectiveness of five strategies for patients experiencing their first CDI recurrence: oral vancomycin, fidaxomicin, fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) via colonoscopy, FMT via oral capsules, and a one-time infusion of bezlotoxumab with vancomycin.

22634,Modelling the lifetime cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation with heart failure,"OBJECTIVES: Assessing the cost-effectiveness credentials of this intervention in patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) compared with usual medical therapy. DESIGN: A Markov model comprising two health states (ie, alive or dead) was constructed. The transition probabilities were directly derived from published Kaplan-Meier curves of the pivotal randomised controlled trial and extrapolated over the cohort''s lifetime using recommended methods. Costs of catheter ablation, outpatient consultations, hospitalisation, medications and examinations were included. Resource use and unit costs were sourced from government websites or published literature. A lifetime horizon and a healthcare system perspective were taken. All costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were run around the key model parameters to test the robustness of the base case results. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical Australian cohort of patients with concomitant AF and HF who are resistant to antiarrhythmic treatment. INTERVENTIONS: Catheter ablation versus medical therapy. RESULTS: The catheter ablation was associated with a cost of $A44 377 per person, in comparison to $A28 506 for the medical therapy alone over a lifetime. Catheter ablation contributed to 4.58 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 6.99 LY gains compared with 4.30 QALYs and 6.53 LY gains, respectively, in the medical therapy arm. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $A55 942/QALY or $A35 020/LY. The DSA showed that results were highly sensitive to costs of ablation and time horizon. The PSA yielded very consistent results with the base case. CONCLUSIONS: Offering catheter ablation procedure to patients with systematic paroxysmal or persistent AF who failed to respond to antiarrhythmic drugs was associated with higher costs, greater benefits.

22635,Cost-effectiveness of a statewide public health intervention to reduce cardiovascular disease risk,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of community health worker (CHW)-based cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk-reduction interventions is not well established. Colorado Heart Healthy Solutions is a CHW-based intervention designed to reduce modifiable CVD risk factors. This program has previously demonstrated success, but the cost-effectiveness is unknown. CHW-based interventions are potentially attractive complements to healthcare delivery because laypersons implement the intervention at a lower cost relative to medical care and may be attractive in rural settings with limited clinical resources. METHODS: CHWs performed screenings and provided ongoing participant support within predominantly rural communities. A point-of-service software tool was used to generate 10-year Framingham CVD risk scores and assist CHWs to make medical referrals and provide ongoing individualized support for lifestyle changes. A sample of program participants returned for reassessment of risk factors. We calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and program costs using a Markov model. Transition probabilities were calculated using Framingham risk equations or derived from the literature using the observed mean reduction in 10-year CVD risk score over of 37- months follow-up. Program cost-effectiveness was calculated for both at-risk (abnormal baseline CVD risk factors) and overall program populations. RESULTS: The base-case scenario evaluating a 52-year-old male participant revealed an incremental cost savings of $3576 and a gain of 0.16 QALYs associated with the intervention. Cost savings were greater in at-risk populations. The economic dominance of the model was robust in multiple sensitivity analyses.

22637,Incremental Cost-Effectiveness of Aspiration Therapy vs Bariatric Surgery and No Treatment for Morbid Obesity,"INTRODUCTION: Despite its recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada, aspiration therapy-one of the latest weight loss treatments-remains controversial. Critics have expressed concerns that the therapy could lead to bulimia and other binge eating disorders. Meanwhile, proponents argue that the therapy is less invasive, reversible, and cheaper than bariatric surgery. Cost-effectiveness of this therapy, however, is not yet established. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of aspiration therapy relative to 2 most common bariatric surgery procedures (gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy) and no treatment over a lifetime horizon. Costs were estimated from the health system''s perspective using US data. Effectiveness was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Despite being a cheaper procedure than bariatric surgery, aspiration therapy costs more than bariatric surgery in the long term because of its high maintenance costs (i.e., periodic replacement of device parts). It also yields lower QALYs than bariatric surgery because of its smaller weight loss effects. Thus, the therapy is dominated by bariatric surgery. In particular, compared with gastric bypass, it costs US$5,318 more and yields 1.31 fewer QALYs. However, aspiration therapy is cost-effective relative to no treatment with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$17,532 per QALY gained.

DESIGN: The aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-based algorithms versus clinical practice in the decision-making process for the implantation of a cardiac resynchronisation device pacemaker versus cardiac resynchronisation device implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device in heart failure patients with indication for cardiac resynchronisation therapy. METHODS: An incidental Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime progression of a heart failure patient cohort. Key health variables included in the model were New York Heart Association functional class, hospitalisations, sudden cardiac death and total mortality. The analysis was done from the healthcare system perspective. Costs (euro2017), survival and quality-adjusted life years were assessed. RESULTS: At 5-year follow-up, algorithm I reduced mortality by 39% in patients with a cardiac resynchronisation device pacemaker who were underprotected due to misclassification by clinical protocol. This approach had the highest quality-adjusted life years (algorithm I 3.257 quality-adjusted life years; algorithm II 3.196 quality-adjusted life years; clinical protocol 3.167 quality-adjusted life years) and the lowest lifetime costs per patient (euro20,960, euro22,319 and euro28,447, respectively).

22643,Economic evaluation of deep-brain stimulation for Tourette's syndrome: an initial exploration,"BACKGROUND: Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) can be effective in controlling medically intractable symptoms of Tourette''s syndrome (TS). There is no evidence to date, though, of the potential cost-effectiveness of DBS for this indication. OBJECTIVE: To provide the first estimates of the likely cost-effectiveness of DBS in the treatment of severe TS. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using clinical data from 17 Australian patients receiving DBS. Direct medical costs for DBS using non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries and for the alternative best medical treatment (BMT), and health utilities for BMT were sourced from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated using a Markov models with a 10-year time horizon and 5% discount rate. RESULTS: DBS increased quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from 2.76 to 4.60 over a 10-year time horizon. The ICER for DBS with non-rechargeable (rechargeable) batteries, compared to BMT, was A$33,838 (A$15,859) per QALY. The ICER estimates are sensitive to DBS costs and selected time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that DBS may be a cost-effective treatment for severe TS, based on the very limited clinical data available and under particular assumptions. While the limited availability of data presents a challenge, we also conduct sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results to the assumptions used in the analysis.

22644,Economic evaluation of deep-brain stimulation for Tourette's syndrome: an initial exploration,"BACKGROUND: Deep-brain stimulation (DBS) can be effective in controlling medically intractable symptoms of Tourette''s syndrome (TS). There is no evidence to date, though, of the potential cost-effectiveness of DBS for this indication. OBJECTIVE: To provide the first estimates of the likely cost-effectiveness of DBS in the treatment of severe TS. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis using clinical data from 17 Australian patients receiving DBS. Direct medical costs for DBS using non-rechargeable and rechargeable batteries and for the alternative best medical treatment (BMT), and health utilities for BMT were sourced from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated using a Markov models with a 10-year time horizon and 5% discount rate. RESULTS: DBS increased quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from 2.76 to 4.60 over a 10-year time horizon. The ICER for DBS with non-rechargeable (rechargeable) batteries, compared to BMT, was A$33,838 (A$15,859) per QALY. The ICER estimates are sensitive to DBS costs and selected time horizon. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that DBS may be a cost-effective treatment for severe TS, based on the very limited clinical data available and under particular assumptions. While the limited availability of data presents a challenge, we also conduct sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the results to the assumptions used in the analysis.

22645,Five-Year Outcomes of a Randomized Trial of Treatments for Varicose Veins,"BACKGROUND: Endovenous laser ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy are recommended alternatives to surgery for the treatment of primary varicose veins, but their long-term comparative effectiveness remains uncertain. METHODS: In a randomized, controlled trial involving 798 participants with primary varicose veins at 11 centers in the United Kingdom, we compared the outcomes of laser ablation, foam sclerotherapy, and surgery. Primary outcomes at 5 years were disease-specific quality of life and generic quality of life, as well as cost-effectiveness based on models of expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained that used data on participants'' treatment costs and scores on the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire. RESULTS: Quality-of-life questionnaires were completed by 595 (75%) of the 798 trial participants. After adjustment for baseline scores and other covariates, scores on the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (on which scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life) were lower among patients who underwent laser ablation or surgery than among those who underwent foam sclerotherapy (effect size [adjusted differences between groups] for laser ablation vs. foam sclerotherapy, -2.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.49 to -1.22; P<0.001; and for surgery vs. foam sclerotherapy, -2.60; 95% CI, -3.99 to -1.22; P<0.001). Generic quality-of-life measures did not differ among treatment groups. At a threshold willingness-to-pay ratio of pound20,000 ($28,433 in U.S. dollars) per QALY, 77.2% of the cost-effectiveness model iterations favored laser ablation. In a two-way comparison between foam sclerotherapy and surgery, 54.5% of the model iterations favored surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial of treatments for varicose veins, disease-specific quality of life 5 years after treatment was better after laser ablation or surgery than after foam sclerotherapy.

22648,Cost-effectiveness of population-level proactive tobacco cessation outreach among socio-economically disadvantaged smokers: evaluation of a randomized control trial,"AIMS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness at population-level of the OPT-IN proactive tobacco cessation outreach program for adult smokers enrolled in publicly funded health insurance plans for low-income persons (e.g. Medicaid). DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a state transition model based on data from the Offering Proactive Treatment Intervention (OPT-IN) randomized control trial. SETTING: The trial was conducted in Minnesota, USA, and the economic analysis was conducted from the Medicaid program perspective. PARTICIPANTS: Data were used from 2406 smokers who were randomized into the intervention or comparator groups. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: The intervention was comprised of proactive outreach (mailed invitation and telephone calls) and free cessation treatment (nicotine replacement therapy and intensive telephone counseling). The comparator was usual care, which comprised access to a primary care physician, insurance coverage of Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved smoking cessation medications and the state''s telephone quitline. MEASUREMENTS: Smoking status, quality of life and health-care use at varying times, including at baseline and 1 year. FINDINGS: The OPT-IN program cost an average of $84 per participant greater than the comparator. One year after randomization, the population-level, 6-month prolonged smoking abstinence rate was 16.5% in the proactive outreach intervention group and 12.1% in the usual care group (P < 0.05). The model projected that the proactive outreach intervention added $78 in life-time cost and generated 0.005 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), with an expected incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $4231 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis found that the proactive outreach intervention would be cost-effective against a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY approximately 68% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Population-level proactive tobacco treatment with personal telephone outreach was effective in achieving higher population-level quit rates and was cost-effective at various willingness-to-pay thresholds, compared with usual care (i.e. reactive treatment). Taken together with prior research, population-level proactive tobacco cessation outreach programs are judged to be highly cost-effective over the long term.",2019-01-32010,31483549,Addiction,Viengneesee Thao,2019,114 / 12,2206-2216,No,31483549,"Viengneesee Thao; Peder L Myhre; Brian Claggett; Christie M Ballantyne; Elizabeth Selvin; Helge Rosjo; Torbjorn Omland; Scott D Solomon; Hicham Skali; Amil M Shah; Cost-effectiveness of population-level proactive tobacco cessation outreach among socio-economically disadvantaged smokers: evaluation of a randomized control trial, Addiction, 2019 Dec; 114(12):0965-2140; 2206-2216",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Care Delivery,proactive outreach for tobacco cessation vs. Standard/Usual Care- usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,15400,United States,2016,16606.55
22649,Meta-Analysis and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Insulin Glargine 100 U/mL Versus Insulin Degludec for the Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes in China,"INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the efficacy and safety as well as the long-term cost-effectiveness of insulin glargine 100 U/mL (IGlar) versus insulin degludec (IDeg) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A systematic search of English and Chinese electronic databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IGlar with IDeg for the treatment of T2DM was performed, followed by a meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of IGlar versus IDeg. The CORE Diabetes Model was used to estimate lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and cost-effectiveness of IGlar versus IDeg. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the underlying parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included in the meta-analysis. The IGlar group showed a statistically significant decrease in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline compared to the IDeg group (mean difference [MD] 0.08%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.14%, P = 0.02). Body mass index (BMI) control was numerically better in the IGlar group than in the IDeg group (MD 0.07 kg/m(2), 95% CI - 0.01 to 0.14 kg/m(2), P = 0.08). In terms of hypoglycemia, the incidence of non-severe overall hypoglycemia was comparable between the IDeg and IGlar patient groups (P > 0.05), while the incidence of non-severe nocturnal hypoglycemia (relative risk [RR 0.79], 95% CI 0.70-0.90, P < 0.01) and the event rates of non-severe overall (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97, P < 0.01) and non-severe nocturnal hypoglycemia (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.97, P < 0.01) were lower in the IDeg group. The incidences and event rates of both severe overall and nocturnal hypoglycemia were similar for the two groups (P > 0.05). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that IGlar is the dominant treatment option compared with IDeg, with a lifetime savings of 1004 Chinese yuan in direct medical costs and a net gain of 0.015 QALYs per patient. Both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSIONS: IGlar is a cost-saving option with incremental effectiveness compared with IDeg for the treatment of T2DM in China.

22650,Cost-effectiveness of expanding the capacity of opioid agonist treatment in Ukraine: dynamic modeling analysis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although opioid agonist treatment (OAT) for opioid use disorder (OUD) is cost-effective in settings where the HIV epidemic is concentrated among people who inject drugs, OAT coverage in Ukraine remains far below internationally recommended targets. Scale-up is limited by both OAT availability and demand. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a range of plausible OAT scale-up strategies in Ukraine incorporating the potential impact of treatment spillover and the real-world demand for addiction treatment. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten-year horizon (2016-25) modeling study of opioid addiction epidemic and treatment that accommodated potential peer effects in opioid use initiation and supply-induced treatment demand in three Ukrainian cities: Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Lviv, comprising a simulated population of people at risk of and with OUD. MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained in the simulated population. FINDINGS: An estimated 12.2-, 2.4- and 13.4-fold OAT capacity increase over 2016 baseline capacity in Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Lviv, respectively, would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of one per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. This result is robust to parametric and structural uncertainty. Even under the most ambitious capacity increase, OAT coverage (i.e. the proportion of people with OUD receiving OAT) over a 10-year modeling horizon would be 20, 11 and 17% in Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Lviv, respectively, owing to limited demand. CONCLUSIONS: It is estimated that a substantial increase in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) capacity in three Ukrainian cities would be cost-effective for a wide range of willingness-to-pay thresholds. Even a very ambitious capacity increase, however, is unlikely to reach internationally recommended coverage levels.

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a range of plausible OAT scale-up strategies in Ukraine incorporating the potential impact of treatment spillover and the real-world demand for addiction treatment. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten-year horizon (2016-25) modeling study of opioid addiction epidemic and treatment that accommodated potential peer effects in opioid use initiation and supply-induced treatment demand in three Ukrainian cities: Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Lviv, comprising a simulated population of people at risk of and with OUD. MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained in the simulated population. FINDINGS: An estimated 12.2-, 2.4- and 13.4-fold OAT capacity increase over 2016 baseline capacity in Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Lviv, respectively, would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of one per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. This result is robust to parametric and structural uncertainty. Even under the most ambitious capacity increase, OAT coverage (i.e. the proportion of people with OUD receiving OAT) over a 10-year modeling horizon would be 20, 11 and 17% in Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Lviv, respectively, owing to limited demand. CONCLUSIONS: It is estimated that a substantial increase in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) capacity in three Ukrainian cities would be cost-effective for a wide range of willingness-to-pay thresholds.

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a range of plausible OAT scale-up strategies in Ukraine incorporating the potential impact of treatment spillover and the real-world demand for addiction treatment. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten-year horizon (2016-25) modeling study of opioid addiction epidemic and treatment that accommodated potential peer effects in opioid use initiation and supply-induced treatment demand in three Ukrainian cities: Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Lviv, comprising a simulated population of people at risk of and with OUD. MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained in the simulated population. FINDINGS: An estimated 12.2-, 2.4- and 13.4-fold OAT capacity increase over 2016 baseline capacity in Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Lviv, respectively, would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of one per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. This result is robust to parametric and structural uncertainty. Even under the most ambitious capacity increase, OAT coverage (i.e. the proportion of people with OUD receiving OAT) over a 10-year modeling horizon would be 20, 11 and 17% in Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Lviv, respectively, owing to limited demand. CONCLUSIONS: It is estimated that a substantial increase in opioid agonist treatment (OAT) capacity in three Ukrainian cities would be cost-effective for a wide range of willingness-to-pay thresholds.

22694,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab monotherapy and chemotherapy in the non-small-cell lung cancer with different PD-L1 tumor proportion scores,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy compared with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with different tumor proportion scores (TPS), from perspectives of payers in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Basic information was derived from the KEYNOTE-042 trial. A Markov model was developed to simulate the process of NSCLC. Model inputs were based on published clinical trials and previous literatures. Costs were calculated from perspectives of payers in China. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainty. RESULTS: Treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with high TPS (>/=50%) was estimated to increase costs by $65,322 compared with chemotherapy, with a gain of 1.79 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $36,493 per QALY. For patient population with TPS>/=20%, the ICER was $42,311 per QALY, while the corresponding ICER was $39,404 per QALY for patients with TPS>/=1%. Sensitive analyses for three different TPS populations were similar, which indicated the cost of PFS state in pembrolizumab arm and the price of pembrolizumab were the most influential factors in our study. CONCLUSION: ICERs yield by pembrolizumab monotherapy among different TPS populations were beyond the threshold we set, three times of the Gross Domestic Product per Capita of China in 2018 ($26,508/QALY).

22696,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab monotherapy and chemotherapy in the non-small-cell lung cancer with different PD-L1 tumor proportion scores,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy compared with chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with different tumor proportion scores (TPS), from perspectives of payers in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Basic information was derived from the KEYNOTE-042 trial. A Markov model was developed to simulate the process of NSCLC. Model inputs were based on published clinical trials and previous literatures. Costs were calculated from perspectives of payers in China. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainty. RESULTS: Treatment with pembrolizumab monotherapy for patients with high TPS (>/=50%) was estimated to increase costs by $65,322 compared with chemotherapy, with a gain of 1.79 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $36,493 per QALY. For patient population with TPS>/=20%, the ICER was $42,311 per QALY, while the corresponding ICER was $39,404 per QALY for patients with TPS>/=1%. Sensitive analyses for three different TPS populations were similar, which indicated the cost of PFS state in pembrolizumab arm and the price of pembrolizumab were the most influential factors in our study. CONCLUSION: ICERs yield by pembrolizumab monotherapy among different TPS populations were beyond the threshold we set, three times of the Gross Domestic Product per Capita of China in 2018 ($26,508/QALY).

22697,Wearable cardioverter-defibrillators in pediatric cardiomyopathy: A cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most common cardiomyopathy in children. Patients with severe cardiac dysfunction are thought to be at risk of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). After diagnosis, a period of medical optimization is recommended before permanent implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) implantation. Wearable cardioverter-defibrillators (WCDs) provide an option for arrhythmia protection as an outpatient during this optimization. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the strategy that optimizes cost and survival during medical optimization of a patient with DCM before ICD placement. METHODS: A Markov state transition model was constructed for the 3 clinical approaches to compare costs, clinical outcomes, and quality of life: (1) ""Inpatient,"" (2) ""Home-WCD,"" and (3) ""Home-No WCD."" Transitional probabilities, costs, and utility metrics were extracted from the existing literature. Cost-effectiveness was assessed comparing each paradigm''s incremental cost-effectiveness ratio against a societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year. RESULTS: The cost-utility analysis illustrated that Home-WCD met the willingness-to-pay threshold with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $20,103 per quality-adjusted life year and 4 mortalities prevented per 100 patients as compared with Home-No WCD. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that Home-No WCD became the most cost-effective solution when the probability of SCA fell below 0.2% per week, the probability of SCA survival with a WCD fell below 9.8%, or the probability of SCA survival with Home-No WCD quadrupled from base-case assumptions. CONCLUSION: Based on the existing literature probabilities of SCA in pediatric patients with DCM undergoing medical optimization before ICD implantation, sending a patient home with a WCD may be a cost-effective strategy.",2019-01-32035,31476408,Heart Rhythm,Patrick D Evers,2019,/,,No,31476408,"Patrick D Evers; Irina Gyllenhammar; Jonathan P Benskin; Oskar Sandblom; Urs Berger; Lutz Ahrens; Sanna Lignell; Karin Wiberg; Anders Glynn; Wearable cardioverter-defibrillators in pediatric cardiomyopathy: A cost-utility analysis, Heart Rhythm, 2019 Sep 14; ():1556-3871",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Device",home with wearable cardioverter-defibrillators vs. Home without wearable cardioverter-defibrillators,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,Not Stated,20103,United States,2018,20719.76

Our objective was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of preventing facility-acquired pressure injuries with a quality improvement bundle, including prophylactic five-layer dressings in US and Australian long-term care. Markov models analysed the cost utility for pressure injuries acquired during long-term care from US and Australian perspectives. Models calibrated outcomes for standard care compared with a dressing-inclusive bundle over 18 monthly cycles or until death based on BORDER III outcomes.
