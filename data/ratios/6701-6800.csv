6704,"Screening for Lymphangioleiomyomatosis with High-Resolution CT in Young, Nonsmoking Women Presenting With Spontaneous Pneumothorax is Cost-Effective","RATIONALE: Women with pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) who present with a sentinel spontaneous pneumothorax (SPTX) will experience an average of 2.5 additional pneumothoraces. The diagnosis of LAM is typically delayed until after the second pneumothorax. Our hypothesis is that targeted screening of a LAM enriched population of nonsmoking women between the ages of 25-54 who present with a sentinel pneumothorax with high resolution CT (HRCT) will facilitate early identification, definitive therapy and improved quality of life for patients with LAM. METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening. Rates of SPTX and prevalence of LAM in populations stratified by age, gender and smoking status were derived from the literature. Costs of testing and treatment were extracted from 2007 Medicare data. We compared a strategy utilizing HRCT screening followed by pleurodesis for patients with LAM, versus no HRCT screening. RESULTS: The prevalence of LAM in nonsmoking women between the ages of 25-54 with SPTX is estimated at 5% based on available literature. In our base case analysis, screening for LAM with HRCT is the most cost-effective strategy with a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $32,980 per quality adjusted life year gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that HRCT screening remains cost-effective for groups in which the prevalence of LAM in the population subset screened is greater than 2.5%. CONCLUSION: Screening for LAM with HRCT in non-smoking women age 25-54 that present with SPTX is cost-effective. Physicians are advised to screen for LAM with HRCT in this population.",2010-01-06070,20167846,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,Jared T Hagaman,2010,/,,No,20167846,"Jared T Hagaman; Screening for Lymphangioleiomyomatosis with High-Resolution CT in Young, Nonsmoking Women Presenting With Spontaneous Pneumothorax is Cost-Effective, Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 2010-Feb-18; ():1073-449X",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) screening vs. No screening,Not Stated,30 Years,30 Years,Female,Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,32980,United States,2007,41166.7
6705,The clinical and economic burden of non-adherence with oral bisphosphonates in osteoporotic patients,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to estimate the clinical and economic burden of non-adherence with oral bisphosphonates in osteoporotic patients and the potential cost-effectiveness of adherence-enhancing interventions. METHODS: A validated Markov microsimulation model estimated costs and outcomes (i.e. the number of fractures and the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY)) for three adherence scenarios: no treatment, real-world adherence and full adherence over 3 years. The real-world adherence scenario employed data from a published observational study. The incremental cost per QALY gained was estimated and compared across the three adherence scenarios. RESULTS: The number of fractures prevented and the QALY gain obtained at real-world adherence levels represented only 38.2% and 40.7% of those expected with full adherence, respectively. The cost per QALY gained of real-world adherence compared with no treatment was estimated at euro10279, and full adherence was found to be cost-saving compared with real-world adherence.

6707,The costs and consequences of omalizumab in uncontrolled asthma from a USA payer perspective,"To cite this article: Campbell JD, Spackman DE, Sullivan SD. The costs and consequences of omalizumab in uncontrolled asthma from a USA payer perspective. Allergy 2010; DOI: 10.1111/j.1398-9995.2010.02336.x. Abstract Background: Omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E antibody, reduces exacerbations and symptoms in uncontrolled allergic asthma. The study objective was to estimate the costs and consequences of omalizumab compared to usual care from a US payer perspective. Methods: We estimated payer costs, quality-adjusted survival (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of omalizumab compared to usual care using a state-transition simulation model that included sensitivity analyses. Every 2 weeks, patients could transition between chronic asthma and exacerbation health states. The best available evidence informed the clinical and cost input estimates. Five years of omalizumab treatment followed by usual care was assumed to estimate a lifetime horizon. Omalizumab responders (60.5% of treated) were modeled as a separate scenario where nonresponders reverted back to usual care after 16 weeks of active treatment. Results: The mean lifetime discounted costs and QALYs were $83 400 and 13.87 for usual care and $174 500 and 14.19 for omalizumab plus usual care resulting in $287 200/QALY (95% interval: $219 300, $557 900). The ICER was $172 300/QALY when comparing omalizumab to usual care in the responder scenario. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were sensitive to the difference in treatment-specific utilities for the chronic state, exacerbation-associated mortality, omalizumab price, exacerbation rates, and response definition. Conclusions: The results suggest that adding omalizumab to usual care improves QALYs at an increase in direct medical costs. The cost-effectiveness of omalizumab is similar to other chronic disease biologics. The value increases when omalizumab response is used to guide long-term treatment.",2010-01-06085,20148804,Allergy,JD Campbell,2010,/,,No,20148804,"JD Campbell; The costs and consequences of omalizumab in uncontrolled asthma from a USA payer perspective, Allergy, 2010-Feb-10; ():0105-4538",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Omalizumab plus usual care, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) vs. Usual care, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,287200,United States,2008,345236.8
6708,Risedronate versus alendronate in older patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture: an Italian cost-effectiveness analysis,"Summary. This evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of risedronate versus generic alendronate is based on effectiveness data from a large real practice study. Applying a published cost-effectiveness model, we found that risedronate is cost-effective versus generic alendronate in an Italian population aged >/=65 years and becomes dominant, saving costs and fractures, in patients aged >/=75 years. Purpose. Scope of this work was to assess the cost-effectiveness and health utility of risedronate compared to generic alendronate in clinical practice in Italy, using effectiveness data from the REAL study. Methods. A pre-existing model of osteoporosis was used to predict numbers of fractures, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs associated with risedronate or alendronate treatment in post-menopausal (PMO) women aged >/=65 years with a previous vertebral fracture, in the Italian National Health System (NHS) perspective. Treatment duration with risedronate or alendronate was assumed to occur for one year and patients were followed for an additional five years to capture long-term cost and outcomes, with a discount rate of 3% for costs and outcomes. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were run. Results. The lower fracture rate among risedronate patients relative to alendronate patients results in savings of euro19,083, a reduction of 8.91 hip fractures and an associated benefit of 7.46 QALYs, in a 1,000 Italian patient cohort. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results. Conclusions. This economic analysis showed that risedronate is a cost-effective treatment in a population of Italian women at high risk of PMO related fractures, aged 65 years and older. Risedronate becomes dominant over generic alendronate in patients of 75 years or older and its cost-effectiveness appears even improved in patients with BMD score </=-3 or </=-3.5, with/without maternal history of fractures.

Applying a published cost-effectiveness model, we found that risedronate is cost-effective versus generic alendronate in an Italian population aged >/=65 years and becomes dominant, saving costs and fractures, in patients aged >/=75 years. Purpose. Scope of this work was to assess the cost-effectiveness and health utility of risedronate compared to generic alendronate in clinical practice in Italy, using effectiveness data from the REAL study. Methods. A pre-existing model of osteoporosis was used to predict numbers of fractures, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs associated with risedronate or alendronate treatment in post-menopausal (PMO) women aged >/=65 years with a previous vertebral fracture, in the Italian National Health System (NHS) perspective. Treatment duration with risedronate or alendronate was assumed to occur for one year and patients were followed for an additional five years to capture long-term cost and outcomes, with a discount rate of 3% for costs and outcomes. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were run. Results. The lower fracture rate among risedronate patients relative to alendronate patients results in savings of euro19,083, a reduction of 8.91 hip fractures and an associated benefit of 7.46 QALYs, in a 1,000 Italian patient cohort. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results. Conclusions. This economic analysis showed that risedronate is a cost-effective treatment in a population of Italian women at high risk of PMO related fractures, aged 65 years and older. Risedronate becomes dominant over generic alendronate in patients of 75 years or older and its cost-effectiveness appears even improved in patients with BMD score </=-3 or </=-3.5, with/without maternal history of fractures.

6716,Cost-effectiveness of the Endeavor stent in de novo native coronary artery lesions updated with contemporary data,"Aims: The Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting coronary stent has been shown to reduce the restenosis rate compared to bare metal stents and has impacted other clinical measures such as mortality, acute myocardial infarctions (AMI) and target vessel revascularisation (TVR). Methods and results: Using pooled efficacy data from the Endeavor clinical trial programme, a model was developed to compare the cost effectiveness of the Endeavor drug eluting stent (DES) with the Driver bare meal stent (BMS) over a four year time period. Endeavor was more costly but had an improved clinical outcome compared to Driver BMS over four years with a 4% reduction in deaths, 33% reduction in AMI and a 45% reduction in TVR. Late stent thrombosis was the only event showing an increased incidence for Endeavor of 0.2% compared to 0% for Driver. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was pound3,757/quality adjusted life years (QALY). Conclusions: Although much controversy has surrounded the appropriate way to assess the cost effectiveness of DES technology, a comprehensive analysis is presented and this suggests that by using extended clinical trial data out to four years, the Endeavor DES in particular, but DES technologies in general, are cost-effective approaches to percutaneous coronary intervention.",2010-01-06091,20142198,EuroIntervention,Edit Remák,2010,5 / 7,826-32,No,20142198,"Edit Remák; Cost-effectiveness of the Endeavor stent in de novo native coronary artery lesions updated with contemporary data, EuroIntervention, 2010-Feb; 5(7):1969-6213; 826-32",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting coronary stent Drug Eluting Stent vs. Bare Metal Stent (Drive),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Years,3.50,3.50,3757,United Kingdom,2007,9388.59
6717,A cost-effectiveness analysis of MMX mesalazine compared with mesalazine in the treatment of mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis from a UK perspective,"Abstract Objectives: To perform a cost-utility analysis of a new formulation of mesalazine (Mezavant XL, MMX mesalazine) versus an existing oral mesalazine (Asacol; mesalazine) from the UK National Health Service perspective. Methods: A 5-year Markov cohort model was developed. Costs were obtained from the literature and utilities from an independent study. Uncertainty was evaluated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). The potential effect of dosing frequency on adherence and possible long-term effects of remission maintenance on colorectal cancer (CRC) rates were also investigated. Results: The model suggested that 5-year therapy with MMX mesalazine was likely to generate gains when compared with mesalazine, including a gain of 0.011 QALYs per patient, 19 more remission days, and 12% fewer hospitalizations and surgical episodes. These gains came at an increase in total NHS direct cost of pound8, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound749. The PSA suggested that MMX mesalazine had a 62% chance of resulting in cost savings, and a 74% chance of being cost effective ( pound20,000 threshold). Extended analysis including adherence and CRC effects suggested further incremental benefit of MMX mesalazine over mesalazine could be expected. Limitations include uncertainty in extrapolation to a 5-year time horizon and impact of adherence and drug acquisition costs on outcomes. Conclusion: The pharmacoeconomic analysis suggested that MMX mesalazine is likely to produce small, but worthwhile, increases in total NHS direct cost while increasing time in remission and associated quality of life, when compared with mesalazine. Advantages in adherence to treatment with MMX mesalazine relative to mesalazine suggested that further health gains and cost savings can be obtained.

6718,To stimulate or withdraw? A cost-utility analysis of recombinant human thyrotropin versus thyroxine withdrawal for radioiodine ablation in patients with low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer in the United States,"CONTEXT: Use of recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) prior to radioactive iodine remnant ablation for patients with differentiated thyroid cancer avoids the hypothyroid state and improves quality of life. European studies have shown that use of rhTSH vs. thyroid hormone withdrawal is a cost-effective method for preparing patients for ablation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the cost-utility of rhTSH prior to ablation in the United States. DESIGN/SETTING/SUBJECTS: A Markov decision model was developed for a hypothetical group of adult patients with low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer who were prepared for ablation by either rhTSH or thyroid hormone withdrawal. Patients entered the model after initial thyroidectomy; follow-up was in accordance with current American Thyroid Association guidelines. Input data were obtained from the literature, Medicare reimbursement schedule, and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all clinically relevant inputs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-utility, measured in U.S. dollars per quality-adjusted life-year ($/QALY), was measured. RESULTS: Use of rhTSH yielded an incremental cost-utility of $52,554/QALY (95% confidence interval $52,058-53,050/QALY) (incremental societal cost of $1,365/patient; incremental benefit of 0.026 QALY/patient). The majority of cost and benefit occurs during the preablation, ablation, and postablation period; differences in cost are due to cost of rhTSH and differences in productivity loss (days off work). The model was most sensitive to changes in time off work, cost of rhTSH, and differences in utilities of health states. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, the cost-effectiveness of rhTSH for ablation in patients with low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer is highly dependent on potential variations in cost of rhTSH, rates of remnant ablation, time off work, and quality of life.",2010-01-06094,20139234,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,Tracy S Wang,2010,95 / 4,1672-80,No,20139234,"Tracy S Wang; To stimulate or withdraw?

6719,The cost-effectiveness of somatropin treatment for short children born small for gestational age (SGA) and children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) in Sweden,"Abstract Objective: Reduction in health-related quality of life is common in children born small for gestational age (SGA) or children with growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Growth hormone treatment with somatropin in these children leads to normalisation of height. The aim of this study was to determine whether somatropin is a cost-effective treatment option for short children born SGA and GHD children in Sweden. Methods: A Markov decision-tree model was used to calculate the relative costs and health benefits associated with somatropin treatment over the lifetime of SGA and GHD children, compared with no treatment. The analysis was undertaken from a Swedish Health Service perspective. As quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) data were not obtained directly in the clinical studies, a degree of uncertainty is related to these results. Sensitivity analyses assessed the degree of uncertainty surrounding central parameters. Results: For short children born SGA, somatropin treatment was associated with an additional 3.29 QALYs at an incremental cost of 792,489 SEK (Swedish Krona), compared with no treatment. For GHD, somatropin treatment resulted in 3.25 additional QALYs at an incremental cost of 391,291 SEK. This equates to an incremental cost per QALY of 240,831 SEK and 120,494 SEK for SGA and GHD, respectively, below a cost-effectiveness threshold of 500,000-600,000 SEK/QALY.

6721,"The cost-effectiveness of solifenacin vs fesoterodine, oxybutynin immediate-release, propiverine, tolterodine extended-release and tolterodine immediate-release in the treatment of patients with overactive bladder in the UK National Health Service","OBJECTIVE To assess the cost-effectiveness of solifenacin vs other antimuscarinic strategies commonly used in UK clinical practice, based on the results of a recent published review. METHODS Overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome is characterized by symptoms of urgency, frequency, incontinence and nocturia. Pharmacological treatment comprises oral antimuscarinic agents, which are divided into older-generation treatments, including oxybutynin, and new-generation treatments, comprising solifenacin, tolterodine, darifenacin and fesoterodine. The latter have reduced central nervous system penetration and have better selectivity for the M3 subclass of acetylcholine receptors, resulting in improved tolerability. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of antimuscarinics provided an opportunity for an economic evaluation of these agents using a rigorous assessment of efficacy. A cost-utility analysis was undertaken using a 1-year decision-tree model. Treatment success was defined separately for urgency, frequency and incontinence, with efficacy data taken from the recent review. Treatment persistence rates were taken from the Information Management System database. Utility values for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were taken from published sources. The analysis included costs directly associated with treatment for OAB, i.e. antimuscarinic therapy, consultations with general practitioners, and outpatient contacts. Resource use was based on expert opinion. Costs were reported at 2007/2008 prices. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the base-case results. RESULTS Solifenacin was associated with the highest QALY gains (per 1000 patients) for all three outcomes of interest, i.e. urgency (712.3), frequency (723.1) and incontinence (695.0). Solifenacin was dominant relative to fesoterodine, tolterodine extended-release (ER) and tolterodine immediate-release (IR), and cost-effective relative to propiverine ER for urgency, frequency and incontinence.

Pharmacological treatment comprises oral antimuscarinic agents, which are divided into older-generation treatments, including oxybutynin, and new-generation treatments, comprising solifenacin, tolterodine, darifenacin and fesoterodine. The latter have reduced central nervous system penetration and have better selectivity for the M3 subclass of acetylcholine receptors, resulting in improved tolerability. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of antimuscarinics provided an opportunity for an economic evaluation of these agents using a rigorous assessment of efficacy. A cost-utility analysis was undertaken using a 1-year decision-tree model. Treatment success was defined separately for urgency, frequency and incontinence, with efficacy data taken from the recent review. Treatment persistence rates were taken from the Information Management System database. Utility values for the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were taken from published sources. The analysis included costs directly associated with treatment for OAB, i.e. antimuscarinic therapy, consultations with general practitioners, and outpatient contacts. Resource use was based on expert opinion. Costs were reported at 2007/2008 prices. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the base-case results. RESULTS Solifenacin was associated with the highest QALY gains (per 1000 patients) for all three outcomes of interest, i.e. urgency (712.3), frequency (723.1) and incontinence (695.0). Solifenacin was dominant relative to fesoterodine, tolterodine extended-release (ER) and tolterodine immediate-release (IR), and cost-effective relative to propiverine ER for urgency, frequency and incontinence. Solifenacin was not found to be cost-effective relative to oxybutynin IR for the frequency and incontinence outcomes, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of > pound30 000/QALY threshold.

6734,Alitretinoin for Severe Chronic Hand Eczema: A NICE Single Technology Appraisal,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of alitretinoin (Basilea Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Basel, Switzerland) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of this drug for the treatment of patients with severe chronic hand eczema (CHE), as part of the Institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process. The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the manufacturer's submission to NICE. The ERG also independently searched for relevant evidence and modified the manufacturer's decision analytic model to examine the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from a single-placebo randomized controlled trial (RCT) of daily treatment with alitretinoin for 12-24 weeks, with follow-up for a further 24 weeks, in patients with severe CHE unresponsive to topical corticosteroids. A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved 'clear' or 'almost clear' hands by week 24 with alitretinoin than those using placebo: 48% with alitretinoin 30 mg (p < 0.001); 28% with alitretinoin 10 mg (p < 0.005); 17% with placebo. Most patients who responded remained in remission during the 24-week follow-up period. The most commonly reported adverse event was dose-dependent headache, with rates of 20% in the alitretinoin 30 mg group and 11% in the alitretinoin 10 mg group, respectively. Serious adverse events were rare, although alitretinoin was associated with increases in both total cholesterol and triglycerides. No direct or indirect comparisons of alitretinoin with any of the relevant treatment comparators (psoralen + UVA [PUVA], ciclosporin or azathioprine) were available. In the manufacturer's original submission to NICE, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported for alitretinoin were pound8614 per QALY versus ciclosporin, - pound469 per QALY versus PUVA (with alitretinoin dominant) and pound10 612 per QALY versus azathioprine (year 2007-8 values). In response to a request from the ERG, the manufacturers provided a revised model that compared alitretinoin only with placebo, for which the ICER was reported to be pound12 931.

6738,"Projected costs, risks, and benefits of expanded newborn screening for MCADD","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) incorporating quality-of-life effects for false-positive newborn screens and recommended dietary treatment. METHODS: A computer simulation model was developed to predict costs and health outcomes for expanded newborn screening for MCADD compared with clinical identification. The modeled target population was a hypothetical cohort of 100 000 newborns in the United States. Probabilities, costs, and quality-of-life weights were derived from a long-term follow-up study of newborn screening compared with clinical identification, primary data collection, published data, and expert opinion. We used a lifetime time horizon and the societal perspective. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Secondary outcomes included averted deaths and hospitalizations. RESULTS: Using base-case assumptions, the cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for MCADD was $21 273 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness ratio increased to $21 278/QALY when the loss in quality of life associated with false-positive test results was incorporated and to $27 423/QALY when the quality of life associated with lifelong dietary recommendations for treating MCADD was incorporated. Results were sensitive to the false-positive rate for the newborn screening test and the cost of the initial screen. CONCLUSIONS: Expanded newborn screening for MCADD is cost-effective compared with well-accepted pediatric health interventions. Losses in quality of life associated with dietary treatment for MCADD, however, may offset some of the gains in QALYs from newborn screening. Consideration of new disorders for expanded newborn screening panels should include the potential reduction in quality of life associated with treatments.",2010-01-06108,20123779,Pediatrics,Lisa A Prosser,2010,125 / 2,e286-94,No,20123779,"Lisa A Prosser; Projected costs, risks, and benefits of expanded newborn screening for MCADD, Pediatrics, 2010-Feb; 125(2):1098-4275; e286-94",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Newborn Screening Program for medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) vs. Clinical Identification of medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,27423,United States,2006,35205.23
6739,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a two-stage screening intervention for hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been the leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan since the 1980s. A two-stage screening intervention was introduced in 1996 and has been implemented in a limited number of hospitals. The present study assessed the costs and health outcomes associated with the introduction of screening intervention, from the perspective of the Taiwanese government. The cost-effectiveness analysis aimed to assist informed decision making by the health authority in Taiwan. METHODS: A two-phase economic model, 1-year decision analysis and a 60-year Markov simulation, was developed to conceptualize the screening intervention within current practice, and was compared with opportunistic screening alone. Incremental analyses were conducted to compare the incremental costs and outcomes associated with the introduction of the intervention. Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the uncertainties that surrounded the model. RESULTS: The Markov model simulation demonstrated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NT$498,000 (US$15,600) per life-year saved, with a 5% discount rate. An ICER of NT$402,000 (US$12,600) per quality-adjusted life-year was achieved by applying utility weights. Sensitivity analysis showed that excess mortality reduction of HCC by screening and HCC incidence rates were the most influential factors on the ICERs. Scenario analysis also indicated that expansion of the HCC screening intervention by focusing on regular monitoring of the high-risk individuals could achieve a more favorable result. CONCLUSION: Screening the population of high-risk individuals for HCC with the two-stage screening intervention in Taiwan is considered potentially cost-effective compared with opportunistic screening in the target population of an HCC endemic area.",2010-01-06111,20123585,J Formos Med Assoc,Sophy Ting-Fang Shih,2010,109 / 1,39-55,No,20123585,"Sophy Ting-Fang Shih; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a two-stage screening intervention for hepatocellular carcinoma in Taiwan, J Formos Med Assoc, 2010-Jan; 109(1):0929-6646; 39-55",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"A two-stage screening, mass screening campaign and subsequent continuing surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) vs. Opportunistic screening alone",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,402000,Taiwan,1997,22598.65
6740,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of fall prevention programs that reduce fall-related hip fractures in older adults,"OBJECTIVES: To model the incremental cost-utility of seven interventions reported as effective for preventing falls in older adults. DESIGN: Mathematical epidemiological model populated by data based on direct clinical experience and a critical review of the literature. SETTING: Model represents population level interventions. PARTICIPANTS: No human subjects were involved in the study. MEASUREMENS: The last Cochrane database review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials categorized effective fall-prevention interventions into seven groups: medical management (withdrawal) of psychotropics, group tai chi, vitamin D supplementation, muscle and balance exercises, home modifications, multifactorial individualized programs for all elderly people, and multifactorial individualized treatments for high-risk frail elderly people. Fall-related hip fracture incidence was obtained from the literature. Salary figures for health professionals were based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Using an integrated healthcare system perspective, healthcare costs were estimated based on practice and studies on falls in older adults. Base case incremental cost utility ratios were calculated, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Medical management of psychotropics and group tai chi were the least-costly, most-effective options, but they were also the least studied. Excluding these interventions, the least-expensive, most-effective options are vitamin D supplementation and home modifications. Vitamin D supplementation costs less than home modifications, but home modifications cost only $14,794/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained more than vitamin D. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses excluding management of psychotropics and tai chi, home modification is most likely to have the highest economic benefit when QALYs are valued at $50,000 or $100,000. CONCLUSION: Of single interventions studied, management of psychotropics and tai chi reduces costs the most. Of more-studied interventions, home modifications provide the best value.

The cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening has not been determined. STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness model simulating disease progression and costs. SETTING & POPULATION: US patients. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, AND TIMEFRAME: The microsimulation model follows up disease progression and costs in a cohort of simulated patients from age 50 to 90 years or death. Costs are evaluated from the health care system perspective. INTERVENTION: Microalbuminuria screening at 1-, 2-, 5-, or 10-year intervals followed by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. We considered universal screening, as well as screening targeted at persons with diabetes, persons with hypertension but no diabetes, and persons with neither diabetes nor hypertension. OUTCOMES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: For the full model population, universal screening increases costs and increases QALYs. Universal annual screening starting at age 50 years has a cost-effectiveness ratio of $73,000/QALY relative to no screening and $145,000/QALY relative to usual care. Cost-effectiveness ratios improved with longer screening intervals. Relative to no screening, targeted annual screening has cost-effectiveness ratios of $21,000/QALY, $55,000/QALY, and $155,000/QALY for persons with diabetes, those with hypertension, and those with neither current diabetes nor current hypertension, respectively.

MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, AND TIMEFRAME: The microsimulation model follows up disease progression and costs in a cohort of simulated patients from age 50 to 90 years or death. Costs are evaluated from the health care system perspective. INTERVENTION: Microalbuminuria screening at 1-, 2-, 5-, or 10-year intervals followed by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers. We considered universal screening, as well as screening targeted at persons with diabetes, persons with hypertension but no diabetes, and persons with neither diabetes nor hypertension. OUTCOMES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: For the full model population, universal screening increases costs and increases QALYs. Universal annual screening starting at age 50 years has a cost-effectiveness ratio of $73,000/QALY relative to no screening and $145,000/QALY relative to usual care. Cost-effectiveness ratios improved with longer screening intervals. Relative to no screening, targeted annual screening has cost-effectiveness ratios of $21,000/QALY, $55,000/QALY, and $155,000/QALY for persons with diabetes, those with hypertension, and those with neither current diabetes nor current hypertension, respectively. LIMITATIONS: Results necessarily are based on a microsimulation model because of the long time horizon appropriate for chronic kidney disease. The model includes only health care costs.

6747,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pemetrexed versus docetaxel in the second-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer in Spain: results for the non-squamous histology population,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness evaluation of pemetrexed compared to docetaxel in the treatment of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients with predominantly non-squamous histology in the Spanish healthcare setting. METHODS: A Markov model was designed consisting of stable, responsive, progressive disease and death states. Patients could also experience adverse events as long as they received chemotherapy. Clinical inputs were based on an analysis of a phase III clinical trial that identified a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for non-squamous patients treated with pemetrexed compared with docetaxel. Costs were collected from the Spanish healthcare perspective. RESULTS: Outcomes of the model included total costs, total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total life years gained (LYG) and total progression-free survival (PFS). Mean survival was 1.03 years for the pemetrexed arm and 0.89 years in the docetaxel arm; QALYs were 0.52 compared to 0.42. Per-patient lifetime costs were 34677 euros and 32343 euros, respectively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 23967 euros per QALY gained and 17225 euros per LYG.

6748,The health and economic effects of HPV DNA screening in The Netherlands,"We studied the health and economic effects of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing in cervical screening using a simulation model. The key data source was a Dutch longitudinal screening trial. We compared cytological testing with repeat cytology (for borderline/mildly abnormal smears) to HPV testing with cytology triage (for HPV-positive smears), combination testing (combined HPV and cytology) and cytological testing with HPV triage (for borderline/mildly abnormal smears). We varied the screening interval from 5 to 10 years. The main outcome measures were the number of cervical cancer cases, the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The base-case estimates were accompanied with ranges across 118 calibrated parameter settings (calibration criteria: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3, cancer and mortality rates). In comparison to 5-yearly cytology, 5-yearly HPV testing with cytology triage gave a reduction in the number of cancer cases of 23% (range, 9-27%). The reduction was 26% (range, 10-29%) for combination testing and 3% (range, -1 to 8%) for cytology with HPV triage. For strategies with primary HPV testing, the model also estimated a reduction in cancer cases when the screening interval was extended to 7.5 years. Five-yearly cytology with HPV triage and 5 to 7.5-yearly HPV testing with cytology triage were cost effective for the base-case settings and the majority of calibrated parameter settings (ICER below Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000/QALY).

6751,Cost effectiveness of eplerenone in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction who were taking both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers: subanalysis of the EPHESUS,"BACKGROUND: The EPHESUS (Eplerenone Post-Acute Myocardial Infarction Heart Failure and Survival Study) showed that the use of aldosterone blockade with eplerenone decreased mortality in patients with heart failure after acute myocardial infarction, and a subsequent analysis showed eplerenone to be highly cost effective in this population. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of eplerenone in an EPHESUS subgroup population who were taking both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers (beta-adrenoceptor antagonists) at baseline. In the EPHESUS, a total of 6632 patients were randomized to receive eplerenone 25-50 mg/day (n = 3319) or placebo (n = 3313) concurrently with standard therapy and were followed for up to 2.5 years. Of these, 4265 (64.3%) patients (eplerenone: n = 2113; placebo: n = 2152) were taking both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers at baseline. METHODS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Resource use after the initial hospitalization included additional hospitalizations, outpatient services, emergency room visits, and medications. Eplerenone was priced at an average wholesale price of $US3.60 per day (year 2004 value). Bootstrap methods were used to estimate the fraction of the joint distribution of the cost and effectiveness. A net-benefit regression model was used to derive the propensity score-adjusted cost-effectiveness curve. The incremental cost effectiveness of eplerenone in cost per life-year gained (LYG) and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained beyond the trial period was estimated using data from the Framingham Heart Study, the Saskatchewan Health database, and the Worcester Heart Attack Registry. Both costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3%. Although not all resource use could be accounted for, the overall perspective was societal. RESULTS: As in the overall EPHESUS population, the total direct treatment costs were higher in the eplerenone arm than the placebo arm for patients who were taking both ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers ($US14,563 vs $US12,850, difference = $US1713; 95% CI 721, 2684). The number of LYGs with eplerenone compared with placebo was 0.1665 based on the Framingham data, 0.0979 using the Saskatchewan data, and 0.2172 using the Worcester data.

6754,Cost-Effectiveness of Osteoporosis Screening Followed by Treatment: The Impact of Medication Adherence,"ABSTRACT Objective: To estimate the impact of medication adherence on the cost-effectiveness of mass-screening by bone densitometry followed by alendronate therapy for women diagnosed with osteoporosis. Methods: A validated Markov microsimulation model with a Belgian health-care payer perspective and a lifetime horizon was used to assess the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of the screening/treatment strategy compared with no intervention. Real-world adherence to alendronate therapy and full adherence over 5 years were both investigated. The real-world adherence scenario employed adherence data from published observational studies, and medication adherence was divided into persistence, compliance, and primary adherence. Uncertainty was investigated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: At 65 years of age, the costs per QALY gained because of the screening/treatment strategy versus no intervention are euro32,008 and euro16,918 in the real-world adherence and full adherence scenarios, respectively. The equivalent values are euro80,836 and euro40,462 at the age of 55 years, and they decrease to euro10,600 and euro1229 at the age of 75 years.

Conclusion: This study indicates that nonadherence with osteoporosis medications substantially increases the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of osteoporosis screening strategies.

Methods: A validated Markov microsimulation model with a Belgian health-care payer perspective and a lifetime horizon was used to assess the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of the screening/treatment strategy compared with no intervention. Real-world adherence to alendronate therapy and full adherence over 5 years were both investigated. The real-world adherence scenario employed adherence data from published observational studies, and medication adherence was divided into persistence, compliance, and primary adherence. Uncertainty was investigated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: At 65 years of age, the costs per QALY gained because of the screening/treatment strategy versus no intervention are euro32,008 and euro16,918 in the real-world adherence and full adherence scenarios, respectively.

6760,Is prophylactic fixation a cost-effective method to prevent a future contralateral fragility hip fracture?,"OBJECTIVE:: A previous hip fracture more than doubles the risk of a contralateral hip fracture. Pharmacologic and environmental interventions to prevent hip fracture have documented poor compliance. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic fixation of the uninjured hip to prevent contralateral hip fracture. METHODS:: A Markov state-transition model was used to evaluate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for unilateral fixation of hip fracture alone (including internal fixation or arthroplasty) compared with unilateral fixation and contralateral prophylactic hip fixation performed at the time of hip fracture or unilateral fixation and bilateral hip pad protection. Prophylactic fixation involved placement of a cephalomedullary nail in the uninjured hip and was initially assumed to have a relative risk of a contralateral fracture of 1%. Health states included good health, surgery-related complications requiring a second operation (infection, osteonecrosis, nonunion, and malunion), fracture of the uninjured hip, and death. The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimated as cost per QALY gained in 2006 US dollars with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below $50,000 per QALY gained considered cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of patient age, annual mortality and complication rates, intervention effectiveness, utilities, and costs on the value of prophylactic fixation. RESULTS:: In the baseline analysis, in a 79-year-old woman, prophylactic fixation was not found to be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $142,795/QALY). However, prophylactic fixation was found to be a cost-effective method to prevent contralateral hip fracture in: 1) women 71 to 75 years old who had 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture; and 2) women younger than age 70 years. Cost-effectiveness was greater when the additional costs of prophylaxis were less than $6000. However, for most analyses, the success of prophylactic fixation was highly sensitive to the effectiveness and the relative morbidity and mortality of the additional procedure. CONCLUSION:: Prophylactic fixation with a cephalomedullary nail was not found to be cost-effective for the average older woman who sustained a hip fracture. However, it may be appropriate for select patient populations.

METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies was compared in a group of hypothetical Finnish RA patients. Initially, the patients received either best supportive care (BSC) or one of the following treatments before BSC: adalimumab (ADAL), abatacept (ABAT), etanercept (ETAN), infliximab (INFL) or rituximab (RTX). Further treatments were added to the most cost-effective strategy in a stepwise manner. The analysis was performed on an Excel-based Markov state transition model using the probabilistic approach. The clinical outcomes related to treatments were estimated from published clinical trials. The gained quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated based on Health Utilities Index (HUI-3) and disease severity scores (HAQ). The resource use and costs were obtained from the Finnish treatment practice, one published study, the Finnish Unit Cost list and Finnish Medicine Tariffs.

6767,Vaccination against pandemic influenza A/H1N1v in England: a real-time economic evaluation,"Decisions on how to mitigate an evolving pandemic are technically challenging. We present a real-time assessment of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative influenza A/H1N1v vaccination strategies. A transmission dynamic model was fitted to the estimated number of cases in real-time, and used to generate plausible autumn scenarios under different vaccination options. The proportion of these cases by age and risk group leading to primary care consultations, National Pandemic Flu Service consultations, emergency attendances, hospitalisations, intensive care and death was then estimated using existing data from the pandemic. The real-time model suggests that the epidemic will peak in early November, with the peak height being similar in magnitude to the summer wave. Vaccination of the high-risk groups is estimated to prevent about 45 deaths (80% credibility interval 26-67), and save around 2900 QALYs (80% credibility interval 1600-4500). Such a programme is very likely to be cost-effective if the cost of vaccine purchase itself is treated as a sunk cost. Extending vaccination to low-risk individuals is expected to result in more modest gains in deaths and QALYs averted. Extending vaccination to school-age children would be the most cost-effective extension. The early availability of vaccines is crucial in determining the impact of such extensions. There have been a considerable number of cases of H1N1v in England, and so the benefits of vaccination to mitigate the ongoing autumn wave are limited. However, certain groups appear to be at significantly higher risk of complications and deaths, and so it appears both effective and cost-effective to vaccinate them. The United Kingdom was the first country to have a major epidemic in Europe. In countries where the epidemic is not so far advanced vaccination of children may be cost-effective.

6768,Review article: methylnaltrexone bromide for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness - a cost-effectiveness analysis,"SUMMARY Background: Opioid-induced constipation is a common adverse event in patients with advanced illness and has a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life and costs. Aim: This study examines the cost-effectiveness of treating opioid-induced constipation with methylnaltrexone bromide (MNTX) plus standard care compared with standard care alone in patients with advanced illness who receive long-term opioid therapy from a third-party payer perspective in the Netherlands. Methods: A decision-analytic model was created in which advanced-illness patients with constipation were treated with MNTX plus standard care or standard care alone. Clinical efficacy in terms of percentage of patients with rescue-free laxation and time to rescue-free laxation were obtained from a randomized, controlled clinical study. Resource use, costs, utilities, and mortality were obtained from published literature and supplemented with data from clinical experts. Results: Treatment with MNTX plus standard care results in more days without constipation symptoms. Cost of MNTX was mostly offset by reduction in other constipation-related costs. Thus, treating with MNTX plus standard care is cost-effective, with an incremental cost per QALY of euro40,865. Results were robust to changes in all parameters. Conclusions: Although using MNTX may increase total costs, MNTX plus standard care is cost-effective in treating advanced-illness patients with opioid-induced constipation.",2010-01-06143,20096019,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,Stephanie R Earnshaw,2010,/,,No,20096019,"Stephanie R Earnshaw; Review article: methylnaltrexone bromide for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness - a cost-effectiveness analysis, Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 2010-Jan-22; ():0269-2813",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Methylnaltrexone bromide + Standard Care (Stable laxative regimen such as contact laxatives, osmotic agents, and stool softeners) vs. Standard Care (Stable laxative regimen such as contact laxatives, osmotic agents, and stool softeners)",Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,49050,Euro,2008,86824.97
6769,Cost effectiveness of mass screening for celiac disease is determined by time-delay to diagnosis and quality of life on a gluten free diet,"ABSTRACT Background: Celiac disease (CD) is frequently diagnosed after a long delay-period resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Aims: To define the parameters which have the highest impact on the cost-effectiveness (CE) of mass screening for celiac disease (CD). Methods: A Markov model examined a CD screening program of the healthy young-adult general population compared to a no-screening strategy. The main outcome measures were quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Effects of variables were examined using sensitivity analyses. Results: The screening strategy resulted in a gain of 0.0027 QALYs. The ICER of screening vs. no-screening strategy was US$48,960/QALYs. The variables with the largest impact on CE were: the time delay from symptom onset to diagnosis, the utility of adherence to a gluten free diet (GFD), and the prevalence of CD. Screening would be cost-effective if the time delay to diagnosis is longer than 6 years, and utility of GFD adherence is greater than 0.978. Conclusions: Our model suggests that mass screening for CD of the young-adult general population is associated with improved QALYs and is a CE strategy. Shortening of the time-delay to diagnosis by heightened awareness of health-care professionals may be a valid alternative to screening.",2010-01-06144,20096017,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,T Hershcovici,2010,/,,No,20096017,"T Hershcovici; Cost effectiveness of mass screening for celiac disease is determined by time-delay to diagnosis and quality of life on a gluten free diet, Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 2010-Jan-19; ():0269-2813",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mass Screening for Celiac disease (CD) vs. No screening,Not Stated,18 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,48960,United States,2004,67079.87

METHODS: A previously-published COPD cost-effectiveness model was adapted for the UK, then used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of tiotropium compared to salmeterol and ipratropium. Additional epidemiological data were used to estimate the budget impact of switching patients from ipratropium or salmeterol to tiotropium. RESULTS: In England, the estimated annual cost per patient on tiotropium was pound1350, on salmeterol was pound1404, and on ipratropium was pound1427; in Scotland/Wales/Northern Ireland (S/W/NI) these costs were pound1439, pound1565, and pound1631, respectively. Tiotropium patients experienced better quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) across all comparisons, and this option was therefore dominant compared to salmeterol and ipratropium.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The internal review board approved the study; written informed consent was obtained from all interviewed patients. Five strategies were evaluated, with CT performed in all patients with MHI; selectively according to the New Orleans criteria (NOC), Canadian CT head rule (CCHR), or CT in head injury patients (CHIP) rule; or in no patients. A decision tree was used to analyze short-term costs and effectiveness, and a Markov model was used to analyze long-term costs and effectiveness. n-Way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and value-of-information (VOI) analysis were performed. Data from the multicenter CHIP Study involving 3181 patients with MHI were used. Outcome measures were first-year and lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Study results showed that performing CT selectively according to the CCHR or the CHIP rule could lead to substantial U.S. cost savings ($120 million and $71 million, respectively), and the CCHR was the most cost-effective at reference-case analysis. When the prediction rule had lower than 97% sensitivity for the identification of patients who required neurosurgery, performing CT in all patients was cost-effective. The CHIP rule was most likely to be cost-effective. At VOI analysis, the expected value of perfect information was $7 billion, mainly because of uncertainty about long-term functional outcomes.

6778,Cost-effectiveness of external cephalic version for term breech presentation,"BACKGROUND: External cephalic version (ECV) is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to convert a breech fetus to vertex position and reduce the need for cesarean delivery. The goal of this study was to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, from society's perspective, of ECV compared to scheduled cesarean for term breech presentation. METHODS: A computer-based decision model (TreeAge Pro 2008, Tree Age Software, Inc.) was developed for a hypothetical base case parturient presenting with a term singleton breech fetus with no contraindications for vaginal delivery. The model incorporated actual hospital costs (e.g., $8,023 for cesarean and $5,581 for vaginal delivery), utilities to quantify health-related quality of life, and probabilities based on analysis of published literature of successful ECV trial, spontaneous reversion, mode of delivery, and need for unanticipated emergency cesarean delivery. The primary endpoint was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained. A threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) was used to determine cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of ECV, assuming a baseline 58% success rate, equaled $7,900/QALY. If the estimated probability of successful ECV is less than 32%, then ECV costs more to society and has poorer QALYs for the patient. However, as the probability of successful ECV was between 32% and 63%, ECV cost more than cesarean delivery but with greater associated QALY such that the cost-effectiveness ratio was less than $50,000/QALY. If the probability of successful ECV was greater than 63%, the computer modeling indicated that a trial of ECV is less costly and with better QALYs than a scheduled cesarean. The cost-effectiveness of a trial of ECV is most sensitive to its probability of success, and not to the probabilities of a cesarean after ECV, spontaneous reversion to breech, successful second ECV trial, or adverse outcome from emergency cesarean. CONCLUSIONS: From society's perspective, ECV trial is cost-effective when compared to a scheduled cesarean for breech presentation provided the probability of successful ECV is > 32%. Improved algorithms are needed to more precisely estimate the likelihood that a patient will have a successful ECV.",2010-01-06152,20092630,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,Jonathan M Tan,2010,10 /,3,No,20092630,"Jonathan M Tan; Cost-effectiveness of external cephalic version for term breech presentation, BMC Pregnancy Childbirth, 2010; 10():1471-2393; 3",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,External cephalic version (ECV) vs. Schedule elective cesarean delivery,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Weeks,3.00,Not Stated,7900,United States,2007,9861.04
6779,Cost-effectiveness of newborn circumcision in reducing lifetime HIV risk among U.S. males,"BACKGROUND: HIV incidence was substantially lower among circumcised versus uncircumcised heterosexual African men in three clinical trials. Based on those findings, we modeled the potential effect of newborn male circumcision on a U.S. male's lifetime risk of HIV, including associated costs and quality-adjusted life-years saved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Given published estimates of U.S. males' lifetime HIV risk, we calculated the fraction of lifetime risk attributable to heterosexual behavior from 2005-2006 HIV surveillance data. We assumed 60% efficacy of circumcision in reducing heterosexually-acquired HIV over a lifetime, and varied efficacy in sensitivity analyses. We calculated differences in lifetime HIV risk, expected HIV treatment costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) among circumcised versus uncircumcised males. The main outcome measure was cost per HIV-related QALY saved. Circumcision reduced the lifetime HIV risk among all males by 15.7% in the base case analysis, ranging from 7.9% for white males to 20.9% for black males. Newborn circumcision was a cost-saving HIV prevention intervention for all, black and Hispanic males. The net cost of newborn circumcision per QALY saved was $87,792 for white males. Results were most sensitive to the discount rate, and circumcision efficacy and cost. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Newborn circumcision resulted in lower expected HIV-related treatment costs and a slight increase in QALYs. It reduced the 1.87% lifetime risk of HIV among all males by about 16%. The effect varied substantially by race and ethnicity. Racial and ethnic groups who could benefit the most from circumcision may have least access to it due to insurance coverage and state Medicaid policies, and these financial barriers should be addressed.

6780,Transferability of Model-Based Economic Evaluations: The Case of Trastuzumab for the Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer in the Netherlands,"ABSTRACT Introduction: Geographic transferability of model-based cost-effectiveness results may facilitate and shorten the reimbursement process of new pharmaceuticals. This study provides a real world example of transferring a cost-effectiveness study of trastuzumab for the adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early breast cancer from the United Kingdom to The Netherlands. Methods: Three successive steps were taken. Step 1: Collect available information with regard to the original model, and assess transferability using existing checklists. Step 2: Adapt transferability-limiting factors. Step 3: Obtain a country-specific estimate of cost-effectiveness. Results: The structure of the UK model was transferable, although some of the model inputs needed adaptation. From a health-care perspective, the Dutch estimate amounted to euro5828/quality-adjusted life-year gained. From a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was dominant. Conclusion: Transferability of a model-based UK-study in three steps proved to be an efficient method to provide an early indication of the cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab and has led to the provisional reimbursement of the treatment.",2010-01-06157,20088894,Value Health,Brigitte AB Essers,2010,/,,Yes,20088894,"Brigitte AB Essers; Transferability of Model-Based Economic Evaluations: The Case of Trastuzumab for the Adjuvant Treatment of HER2-Positive Early Breast Cancer in the Netherlands, Value Health, 2010-Jan-15; ():1098-3015",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adjuvant trastuzumab given for 1 year upon presentation with early breast cancer vs. No adjuvant treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,45 Years,4.00,1.50,-3.76,Euro,2008,-6.65
6781,Pelvic floor consequences of cesarean delivery on maternal request in women with a single birth: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The potential benefit in preventing pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is a frequently cited reason for requesting or performing cesarean delivery on maternal request (CDMR). However, for primigravid women without medical/obstetric indications, the lifetime cost-effectiveness of CDMR remains unknown, particularly with regard to lifelong pelvic floor consequences. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of CDMR in comparison to trial of labor (TOL) for primigravid women without medical/obstetric indications with a single childbirth over their lifetime, while explicitly accounting for the management of PFD throughout the lifetime. METHODS: We used Monte Carlo simulation of a decision model containing 249 chance events and 101 parameters depicting lifelong maternal and neonatal outcomes in the following domains: actual mode of delivery, emergency hysterectomy, transient maternal morbidity and mortality, perinatal morbidity and mortality, and the lifelong management of PFDs. Parameter estimates were obtained from published literature. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective. All costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted to the present value at childbirth. RESULTS: The estimated mean cost and QALYs were $14,259 (95% confidence interval [CI] $8,964-$24,002) and 58.21 (95% CI 57.43-58.67) for CDMR and $13,283 (95% CI $7,861-$23,829) and 57.87 (95% CI 56.97-58.46) for TOL over the combined lifetime of the mother and the child. Parameters related to PFDs play an important role in determining cost and quality of life.

6782,Assessing the cost effectiveness of using prognostic biomarkers with decision models: case study in prioritising patients waiting for coronary artery surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of using information from circulating biomarkers to inform the prioritisation process of patients with stable angina awaiting coronary artery bypass graft surgery. DESIGN: Decision analytical model comparing four prioritisation strategies without biomarkers (no formal prioritisation, two urgency scores, and a risk score) and three strategies based on a risk score using biomarkers: a routinely assessed biomarker (estimated glomerular filtration rate), a novel biomarker (C reactive protein), or both. The order in which to perform coronary artery bypass grafting in a cohort of patients was determined by each prioritisation strategy, and mean lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared. DATA SOURCES: Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry (9935 patients with stable angina awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting and then followed up for cardiovascular events after the procedure for 3.8 years), and meta-analyses of prognostic effects (relative risks) of biomarkers. RESULTS: The observed risk of cardiovascular events while on the waiting list for coronary artery bypass grafting was 3 per 10,000 patients per day within the first 90 days (184 events in 9935 patients). Using a cost effectiveness threshold of pound20,000- pound30,000 (euro22,000-euro33,000; $32,000-$48,000) per additional QALY, a prioritisation strategy using a risk score with estimated glomerular filtration rate was the most cost effective strategy (cost per additional QALY was < pound410 compared with the Ontario urgency score). The impact on population health of implementing this strategy was 800 QALYs per 100,000 patients at an additional cost of pound 245,000 to the National Health Service. The prioritisation strategy using a risk score with C reactive protein was associated with lower QALYs and higher costs compared with a risk score using estimated glomerular filtration rate. CONCLUSION: Evaluating the cost effectiveness of prognostic biomarkers is important even when effects at an individual level are small. Formal prioritisation of patients awaiting coronary artery bypass grafting using a routinely assessed biomarker (estimated glomerular filtration rate) along with simple, routinely collected clinical information was cost effective. Prioritisation strategies based on the prognostic information conferred by C reactive protein, which is not currently measured in this context, or a combination of C reactive protein and estimated glomerular filtration rate, is unlikely to be cost effective.

6786,Huge impact of assumptions on indirect effects on the cost-effectiveness of routine infant vaccination with 7-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar),"Several recently published European cost-effectiveness studies on the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7: Prevnar((R))) have included net-indirect vaccine benefits for non-vaccine protected groups into their studies, which might be too optimistic an approach given recent data. Net-indirect effects result from herd protection minus serotype replacement effects. In this study we analyze the impact of net-indirect effects in non-vaccine protected groups of 5 years of age and older with updated assumptions regarding epidemiologic data and health care unit costs. Without net-indirect benefits for non-vaccine protected groups included the cost-effectiveness ratio is estimated at euro72,360 per QALY. In order to obtain cost-effectiveness ratios below the threshold of euro50,000 per QALY - which is in the middle of the range that is often referred to in the Netherlands - the net-indirect protective effect should at least be 16% of which has been observed in the USA after the introduction of PCV-7.",2010-01-06160,20085833,Vaccine,Mark H Rozenbaum,2010,28 / 12,2367-9,Yes,20085833,"Mark H Rozenbaum; Huge impact of assumptions on indirect effects on the cost-effectiveness of routine infant vaccination with 7-valent conjugate vaccine (Prevnar), Vaccine, 2010-Mar-11; 28(12):1873-2518; 2367-9",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7; Prevnar®) vs. No vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,4.00,1.50,72360,Euro,2008,128086.74

Methods: The routine vaccination of 12-year-old girls and the routine vaccination of 12-year-old girls plus a temporary catch-up programme for girls and women aged 12-24 years was evaluated. Results: The model projected that at year 100, both strategies could reduce the incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-related cervical cancer, CIN 2/3, CIN 1 and genital warts cases among Hungarian women by 90%, 90%, 85% and 93%, respectively.

Methods: Results from four randomized controlled trials comparing the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy regimens: mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, and prednisolone (MCP); cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP); cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP); or cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, prednisolone, and interferon alpha (CHVP + IFNalpha) versus chemotherapy alone were used to develop a Markov model. The rates of disease progression and the duration of treatment effect were obtained from the trial data. Treatments were compared in two ways: 1) an individual comparison of rituximab + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and 2) a multiple treatment comparison using league tables. Economic and clinical outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) were estimated over patient lifetimes and discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: In the individual comparison, the addition of rituximab increased QALYs by (mean, 95% confidence interval) 1.174 (1.02-1.30), 0.909 (0.79-1.01), 0.823 (0.71-0.91), and 0.453 (0.40-0.50) for MCP, CVP, CHOP, and CHVP, respectively, compared with chemotherapy alone.

6791,An Evaluation of the Cost-Effectiveness of Rituximab in Combination with Chemotherapy for the First-Line Treatment of Follicular Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma in the UK,"ABSTRACT Objectives: In this study, the cost-effectiveness of rituximab was evaluated in comparison with commonly used chemotherapy regimens for patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL), from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). Methods: Results from four randomized controlled trials comparing the addition of rituximab to chemotherapy regimens: mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, and prednisolone (MCP); cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP); cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP); or cyclophosphamide, etoposide, doxorubicin, prednisolone, and interferon alpha (CHVP + IFNalpha) versus chemotherapy alone were used to develop a Markov model. The rates of disease progression and the duration of treatment effect were obtained from the trial data. Treatments were compared in two ways: 1) an individual comparison of rituximab + chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and 2) a multiple treatment comparison using league tables. Economic and clinical outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) were estimated over patient lifetimes and discounted at 3.5% per annum. Results: In the individual comparison, the addition of rituximab increased QALYs by (mean, 95% confidence interval) 1.174 (1.02-1.30), 0.909 (0.79-1.01), 0.823 (0.71-0.91), and 0.453 (0.40-0.50) for MCP, CVP, CHOP, and CHVP, respectively, compared with chemotherapy alone. The incremental costs per QALY gained were pound7474, pound8621, pound10,732, and pound8551, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that rituximab plus chemotherapy was a cost-effective treatment option, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below a threshold of pound30,000 per QALY gained.

6793,Cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel in STEMI patients in the Netherlands: a model based on the CLARITY trial,"OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the costs and effects of combination treatment with clopidogrel and aspirin in comparison to aspirin alone in patients with an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a Dutch setting. METHODS: A decision tree model is used to combine data from different sources about efficacy, epidemiology and costs. In the short-run, cost-effectiveness is based on efficacy data derived from the CLARITY trial. The cost-effectiveness of continued treatment is addressed by analysing which conditions need to be fulfilled to deem the strategy 'cost-effective', and discussing whether it is likely that it is. Estimates concerning the benefits of preventing events are derived from Swedish registries. Approximations of both direct and indirect costs are derived from the literature. Effects are expressed as life years gained and Quality Adjust Life Years (QALYs). Uncertainties are addressed by uni- and multivariate sensitivity analyses with and without taking account of the dependency between the separate ischaemic events. RESULTS: A treatment regimen similar to that of the CLARITY trial, including patients similar to those in the trial, is estimated to result in 0.05 additional life years and 0.062 additional quality adjusted life years for a cost that is euro1929 lower than aspirin therapy. Continuation of treatment outside the trial period is expected to result in ICERs of below euro20,000 per QALY as long as the real risk reduction of combination treatment is greater than 0.487% per year. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that clopidogrel therapy combined with aspirin, according to the regimen seen in CLARITY, and using data from Swedish registries to inform the model, is cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses suggest that the model is robust to a wide range of parameter estimates, including those based on data from Swedish registries.

6794,Cost effectiveness of atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a pharmacoeconomic analysis of the collaborative atorvastatin diabetes study in the belgian population,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a high risk of developing cardiovascular (CV) disease. The clinical benefit of use of statins in patients with type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated in several randomized, controlled trials, including the CARDS clinical trial. Based on the clinical CARDS data, the favourable cost effectiveness of atorvastatin 10 mg in patients with type 2 diabetes has been demonstrated in countries such as the UK and France. This study aimed to estimate the cost effectiveness in the Belgian setting of atorvastatin 10 mg compared with no treatment for the primary prevention of CV events in type 2 diabetes patients without a history of CV disease. METHODS: A Markov model with 1-year cycles was developed to simulate the CV event and death risk according to the therapeutic approach initiated. The transition probabilities for CV events in the 'no statin treatment' group were derived from the risk equations reported from the large UKPDS. Risk reductions from the CARDS clinical trial were used to adjust these CV event probabilities in the atorvastatin 10 mg treatment group. The characteristics of type 2 diabetes patients without a CV history were derived from the Belgian OCAPI survey. The public healthcare payers' perspective was taken into account for costing. The direct medical costs of CV events were based on the Public Health Authorities' hospital database for acute care costs and on the literature for the follow-up costs. The impact on the reimbursement system of generic entry to the market was considered in the drug cost. Costs were valued as at year 2009; costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% and 1.5%, respectively. RESULTS: Based on a 5-year time horizon, atorvastatin was demonstrated to be cost effective with an incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of euro 16,681. Over a lifetime horizon (25 years), atorvastatin was demonstrated to be a cost-saving therapeutic intervention. At a threshold of euro 30,000/QALY, atorvastatin had a 98.8% probability of being cost effective.

6796,Cost effectiveness of a lidocaine 5% medicated plaster compared with pregabalin for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in the UK: a Markov model analysis,"BACKGROUND: Published analyses have demonstrated that the lidocaine (lignocaine) plaster is a cost-effective treatment for postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) relative to gabapentin or pregabalin. However, these analyses have been based on indirect comparisons from placebo-controlled trials, and there is evidence of a discrepancy between the outcomes of direct and indirect analyses. Fortunately, recent publication of the results of a head-to-head trial comparing the lidocaine plaster and pregabalin in patients with PHN or diabetic polyneuropathy allows customization of the existing model to more accurately reflect the relative cost effectiveness of these two products. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the lidocaine 5% medicated plaster compared with pregabalin for the treatment of PHN in the UK primary-care setting. METHODS: A Markov model has been developed to assess the costs and benefits of the lidocaine plaster and pregabalin over a 6-month time horizon for the treatment of patients with PHN who are intolerant to tricyclic antidepressants and in whom analgesics are ineffective or contraindicated. The model structure allows for differences in costs, utilities (derived from published data and from the head-to-head trial) and transition probabilities between the initial 30-day run-in period and maintenance therapy, and also takes account of add-in medication and drugs received by patients discontinuing therapy. The calculation was based on data from the recent head-to-head trial described above. Additional data sources included published literature, discussions with a Delphi panel, official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The study was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). RESULTS: The base-case analysis (1.71 lidocaine plasters per day used in the head-to-head trial for the PHN population) indicated that the total cost of treating PHN patients for 6 months with the lidocaine plaster was pound 980 per patient treated, compared with pound 784 for pregabalin (year of costing 2009). Costs for 1 month without pain and intolerable adverse events (AEs) (modified TWIST analysis) were pound 126 for the lidocaine plaster relative to pregabalin. The average patient treated with the lidocaine plaster experienced 0.321 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over the 6-month period modelled compared with 0.254 QALYs for pregabalin. Quality-of-life benefits were attributed to the favourable AE profile of the lidocaine plaster. Subsequently, the lidocaine plaster cost pound 2925 per QALY gained relative to pregabalin. However, patient level longitudinal data have shown that the actual clinical usage of the lidocaine plaster is 1.1 plasters per day. If this more realistic assumption is used in the model, the total cost for a 6-month treatment period was pound 756 for the lidocaine plaster, which dominated treatment with pregabalin. Scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses had minimal impact on the results, confirming the robustness of the study. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the lidocaine plaster remained well below pound 35,000 per QALY gained in all analyses. CONCLUSION: This analysis showed that the lidocaine 5% medicated plaster is a cost-effective method for obtaining sustained relief of localized neuropathic pain associated with PHN compared with pregabalin in a UK setting, in terms of both the cost per QALY gained and the cost per additional month without symptoms, when used for patients who do not experience sufficient pain relief from standard analgesics.",2010-01-06180,20067326,Clin Drug Investig,Mark Ritchie,2010,30 / 2,71-87,Yes,20067326,"Mark Ritchie; Cost effectiveness of a lidocaine 5% medicated plaster compared with pregabalin for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in the UK: a Markov model analysis, Clin Drug Investig, 2010; 30(2):1173-2563; 71-87",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lidocaine plaster (three 140 cm squared per day for duration of pain) vs. Pregabalin 150-600 mg/day,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,2925,United Kingdom,2009,5109.2
6797,A cost-effectiveness analysis of the Chlamydia Monday--a community-based intervention to decrease the prevalence of chlamydia in Sweden,"AIMS: The study was undertaken to assess the cost-effectiveness of the Chlamydia Monday, 2007. This is a community-based intervention aimed at reducing the prevalence of chlamydia by information and increased availability of testing, treatment and contact tracing in Stockholm. The aim was to analyze the cost-effectiveness by estimating costs, savings and effects on health associated with the intervention, and to determine if cost-effectiveness varies between men and women. METHODS: A societal perspective was adopted, meaning all significant costs and consequences were taken into consideration, regardless of who experienced them. A cost-effectiveness model was constructed including costs of the intervention, savings due to avoiding potential costs associated with medical sequels of chlamydia infection, and health gains measured as quality adjusted life years (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were done to explore model and result uncertainty. RESULTS: Total costs were calculated to be 66,787.21; total savings to 30,370.14; and total health gains to 9.852324 QALYs (undiscounted figures). The discounted cost per QALY was 8,346.05 (10,810.77/QALY for women and 6,085.35/QALY for men). Sensitivity analyses included changes in effectiveness, variation of prevalence, reduced risk of sequel progression, inclusion of prevented future production loss and shortened duration for chronic conditions. The cost per QALY was consistently less than 50,000, which is often regarded as cost-effective in a Swedish context.
