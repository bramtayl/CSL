8102,Strategies for the Prevention of Postoperative Recurrence in Crohn's Disease: Results of a Decision Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES:Nearly 70% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) undergo surgical resection, with one-quarter subsequently developing clinical recurrence within 12 months. Several options exist for the prevention of postoperative recurrence in CD, but the comparative cost effectiveness of these competing strategies has not been previously analyzed.METHODS:We developed a decision analytic model comprising five strategies-No Treatment, azathioprine (AZA), antibiotics (ABX), upfront infliximab (IFX), and tailored IFX that consisted of no upfront therapy with initiation of IFX in patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. The base-case 1-year clinical recurrence rate was 24% with reduction in recurrence by 41%, 77%, and 99% for AZA, ABX, and IFX, respectively. A 1-year time horizon was used and sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS:At the base-case analysis, the ABX (0.82 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) and AZA (0.81 QALYs) arms were more effective and less expensive than the No Treatment strategy (0.80 QALYs). The most effective strategy was upfront IFX (0.83 QALYs); however, this was also the most expensive and resulted in a high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ($777,732/QALY) compared with no treatment. The tailored IFX arm was less effective than upfront use but had a more acceptable ICER. On increasing the recurrence rate to 78% (high-risk patients), upfront IFX resulted in 0.07 QALYs (ICER $130,580/QALY) gained compared with No Treatment, whereas ABX, AZA, and tailored IFX arms dominated No Treatment.CONCLUSION:Antibiotics are the most cost-effective option for preventing postoperative recurrence, but they have been associated with high rates of intolerance precluding widespread use. Upfront IFX is the most efficacious strategy but is not cost effective even in high-risk patients. Reserving IFX use for high-risk patients with early endoscopic recurrence is more cost effective than upfront use in all patients.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 26 July 2011; doi:10.1038/ajg.2011.237.",2011-01-07735,21788991,Am J Gastroenterol,Ashwin N Ananthakrishnan,2011,/,,No,21788991,"Ashwin N Ananthakrishnan; Chin Hur; Pascal Juillerat; Joshua R Korzenik; Strategies for the Prevention of Postoperative Recurrence in Crohn's Disease: Results of a Decision Analysis., Am J Gastroenterol, ; ():0002-9270",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Tailored Infliximab (IFX)- patients with severe endoscopic recurrence and low-risk patients developing clinical recurrence are treated with IFX, no therapy for patients with no or mild endoscopic recurrence and patients on no treatment underwent colonoscopy vs. Antibiotics (ABX)",Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-17300000,United States,2010,-20533396.47

On increasing the recurrence rate to 78% (high-risk patients), upfront IFX resulted in 0.07 QALYs (ICER $130,580/QALY) gained compared with No Treatment, whereas ABX, AZA, and tailored IFX arms dominated No Treatment.CONCLUSION:Antibiotics are the most cost-effective option for preventing postoperative recurrence, but they have been associated with high rates of intolerance precluding widespread use. Upfront IFX is the most efficacious strategy but is not cost effective even in high-risk patients.

8123,An economic evaluation of a systems-based strategy to expedite surgical treatment of hip fractures.,"A recent systematic review has indicated that mortality within the first year after hip fracture repair increases significantly if the time from hospital admission to surgery exceeds forty-eight hours. Further investigation has shown that avoidable, systems-based factors contribute substantially to delay in surgery. In this study, an economic evaluation was conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical scenario in which resources are allocated to expedite surgery so that it is performed within forty-eight hours after admission.We created a decision tree to tabulate incremental cost and quality-adjusted life years in order to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two potential strategies. Several factors, including personnel cost, patient volume, percentage of patients receiving surgical treatment within forty-eight hours, and mortality associated with delayed surgery, were considered. One strategy focused solely on expediting preoperative evaluation by employing personnel to conduct the necessary diagnostic tests and a hospitalist physician to conduct the medical evaluation outside of regular hours. The second strategy added an on-call team (nurse, surgical technologist, and anesthesiologist) to staff an operating room outside of regular hours.The evaluation-focused strategy was cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $2318 per quality-adjusted life year, and became cost-saving (a dominant therapeutic approach) if =93% of patients underwent expedited surgery, the hourly cost of retaining a diagnostic technologist on call was <$20.80, or <15% of the hospitalist's salary was funded by the strategy. The second strategy, which added an on-call surgical team, was also cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $43,153 per quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis revealed that this strategy remained cost-effective if the odds ratio of one-year mortality associated with delayed surgery was >1.28, =88% of patients underwent early surgery, or =339.9 patients with a hip fracture were treated annually.The results of our study suggest that systems-based solutions to minimize operative delay, such as a dedicated on-call support team, can be cost-effective.

Yet, to date, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of this approach. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of EGFR testing and first-line treatment with gefitinib for those patients who harbor activating mutations versus standard care, which includes first-line treatment with chemotherapy followed by gefitinib as second-line treatment. The model uses clinical and outcomes data from randomized clinical trials and societal costs from Singapore cancer centers. Health effects were expressed as quality-adjusted life-years. All costs and cost-effectiveness ratios were expressed in 2010 Singapore dollars. Sensitivity and different scenarios analyses were conducted. RESULTS: EGFR testing and first-line treatment with gefitinib is a dominant strategy (with lower costs and greater effectiveness) compared with standard care. Because the primary savings result from not providing gefitinib to those who are not likely to benefit, this finding holds regardless of the prevalence of activating mutations. In a secondary analysis, first-line treatment with gefitinib was also dominant when compared with first-line chemotherapy in patients with activating EGFR mutations. CONCLUSIONS: This strategy can be considered a new standard of care and should be of great interest for health care payers and decision makers in an era in which our greatest challenge is to balance hard-won and incremental, yet small, improvements in patient outcomes with exponentially rising costs.

8127,The cost-effectiveness of an intensive treatment protocol for severe dyslexia in children.,"Studies of interventions for dyslexia have focused entirely on outcomes related to literacy. In this study, we considered a broader picture assessing improved quality of life compared with costs. A model served as a tool to compare costs and effects of treatment according to a new protocol and care as usual. Quality of life was measured and valued by proxies using a general quality-of-life instrument (EQ-5D). We considered medical cost and non-medical cost (e.g. remedial teaching). The model computed cost per successful treatment and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) in time. About 75% of the total costs was related to diagnostic tests to distinguish between children with severe dyslexia and children who have reading difficulties for other reasons. The costs per successful treatment of severe dyslexia were ?36?366. Successful treatment showed a quality-of-life gain of about 11%. At primary school, the average cost per QALY for severe dyslexia amounted to ?58?647. In the long term, the cost per QALY decreased to ?26?386 at secondary school and ?17?663 thereafter.

Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of universal vaccination of 11-year-old girls against human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and increased screening coverage to prevent cervical cancer in Japan where the coverage of Papanicolaou smears is very low. Design A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective. Setting Japan, 2010. Population The female Japanese population aged 11 years or older. Methods A Markov model of the natural history of cervical cancer was constructed to compare six strategies: i.e. a screening coverage rate of 20, 50 and 80% with and without routine vaccination at age 11. Main outcome measures Cervical cancer incidence, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results Expanding the coverage of Papanicolaou smears from the current level of 20-50 and 80% yields a 45.5 and 63.1% reduction in cervical cancer incidence, respectively. Impact of combined strategies increases with coverage. Coverages of 20, 50 and 80% showed a 66.1, 80.9 and 86.8% reduction in disease, respectively. The costs of strategies with vaccination are four times higher than the cost of strategies without vaccination. Vaccinating all 11-year-old girls with bivalent vaccines with a Papanicolaou smear coverage rate of 50% is likely to be the most cost-effective option among the six strategies.

8147,A Markov model to analyze cost-effectiveness of screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID).,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal neonatal screening for T cell lymphocytopenia in enhancing quality of life and life expectancy for children with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). METHODS: Decision trees were created and analyzed to estimate the cost, life years, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) across a population when universal screening for lack of T cells is used to detect SCID, as implemented in five states, compared to detection based on recognizing symptoms and signs of disease. Terminal values of each tree limb were derived through Markov models simulating the natural history of three cohorts: unaffected subjects; those diagnosed with SCID as neonates (early diagnosis); and those diagnosed after becoming symptomatic and arousing clinical suspicion (late diagnosis). Models considered the costs of screening and of care including hematopoietic cell transplantation for affected individuals. Key decision variables were derived from the literature and from a survey of families with children affected by SCID, which was used to describe the clinical history and healthcare utilization for affected subjects. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the influence of these decision variables. RESULTS: Over a 70-year time horizon, the average cost per infant was $8.89 without screening and $14.33 with universal screening. The model predicted that universal screening in the U.S. would cost approximately $22.4million/year with a gain of 880 life years and 802 QALYs. Sensitivity analyses showed that screening test specificity and disease incidence were critical driving forces affecting the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Assuming a SCID incidence of 1/75,000 births and test specificity and sensitivity each at 0.99, screening remained cost-effective up to a maximum cost of $15 per infant screened. CONCLUSION: At our current estimated screening cost of $4.22/infant, universal screening for SCID would be a cost effective means to improve quality and duration of life for children with SCID.",2011-01-07762,21810544,Mol Genet Metab,Kee Chan,2011,/,,No,21810544,"Kee Chan; Joie Davis; Sung-Yun Pai; Francisco A Bonilla; Jennifer M Puck; Michael Apkon; A Markov model to analyze cost-effectiveness of screening for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)., Mol Genet Metab , ; ():1096-7206",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC) assay neonatal screening for T cell lymphocytopenia vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,70 Years,3.00,3.00,27907,United States,2005,36982.28

8151,The effect of pulmonary artery catheter use on costs and long-term outcomes of acute lung injury.,"The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) remains widely used in acute lung injury (ALI) despite known complications and little evidence of improved short-term mortality. Concurrent with NHLBI ARDS Clinical Trials Network Fluid and Catheters Treatment Trial (FACTT), we conducted a prospectively-defined comparison of healthcare costs and long-term outcomes for care with a PAC vs. central venous catheter (CVC). We explored if use of the PAC in ALI is justified by a beneficial cost-effectiveness profile.We obtained detailed bills for the initial hospitalization. We interviewed survivors using the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 questionnaire at 2, 6, 9 and 12 m to determine quality of life (QOL) and post-discharge resource use. Outcomes beyond 12 m were estimated from federal databases. Incremental costs and outcomes were generated using MonteCarlo simulation.Of 1001 subjects enrolled in FACTT, 774 (86%) were eligible for long-term follow-up and 655 (85%) consented. Hospital costs were similar for the PAC and CVC groups ($96.8k vs. $89.2k, p?=?0.38). Post-discharge to 12 m costs were higher for PAC subjects ($61.1k vs. 45.4k, p?=?0.03). One-year mortality and QOL among survivors were similar in PAC and CVC groups (mortality: 35.6% vs. 31.9%, p?=?0.33; QOL [scale: 0-1]: 0.61 vs. 0.66, p?=?0.49). MonteCarlo simulation showed PAC use had a 75.2% probability of being more expensive and less effective (mean cost increase of $14.4k and mean loss of 0.3 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) and a 94.2% probability of being higher than the $100k/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold.PAC use increased costs with no patient benefit and thus appears unjustified for routine use in ALI.www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT00234767.",2011-01-07765,21811626,PLoS One,Gilles Clermont,2011,6 /,e22512,No,21811626,"Gilles Clermont; Lan Kong; Lisa A Weissfeld; Judith R Lave; Gordon D Rubenfeld; Mark S Roberts; Alfred F Connors; Gordon R Bernard; B Taylor Thompson; Arthur P Wheeler; Derek C Angus; NHLBI ARDS Clinical Trials Netwo; The effect of pulmonary artery catheter use on costs and long-term outcomes of acute lung injury., PLoS One , ; 6 ():1932-6203; e22512",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pulmonary artery cathether (PAC) vs. Central venous catheter (CVC),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-48,United States,2010,-56.97
8152,Costs and health effects of adding functional foods containing phytosterols/-stanols to statin therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.,"The present modelling study aimed to evaluate if and by how much functional foods containing phytosterols/-stanols add to the benefits of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular disease in terms of cost-effectiveness. Long-term health effects, measured as quality-adjusted life-years gained, and costs for scenarios with additional phytosterol/-stanol use were compared to scenarios without extra use. Phytosterols/-stanols were given only to persons who were eligible for use according to their 10-year absolute risk of fatal cardiovascular disease (SCORE-risk). Intake levels and discontinuation rates as observed in daily practice were included in the model. Two situations were compared: 1) A real-life situation in which persons at high SCORE-risk were identified through clinical case-finding and, 2) A theoretical maximum situation where universal screening was implemented resulting in known SCORE-risks for the whole Dutch population aged 35-75years (8.4 million people). Sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in the cholesterol-lowering effect and intake level of phytosterols/-stanols, indirect health care costs, time horizon and discount rates. At the model's start year, a total of 1.0 (real-life situation) to 3.3 (maximum situation) million persons qualified for phytosterol/-stanol use based on their SCORE-risk (both statin users and statin non-users). Over the model's time horizon, this resulted in a gain of 2700 to 16,300 quality-adjusted life-years, and yielded cost-effectiveness ratios that ranged between ?92,000 and ?203,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. This simulation study showed that the cost-effectiveness of phytosterols/-stanols as monotherapy and as add-on to statins is above thresholds for cost-effectiveness, generally ranging between ?20,000 and ?50,000, and is thus a non-cost-effective strategy to reduce cardiovascular disease.",2011-01-07768,21816151,Eur J Pharmacol,Simone R B M Eussen,2011,/,,No,21816151,"Simone R B M Eussen; Talitha L Feenstra; Ido B Toxopeus; Jeljer Hoekstra; Olaf H Klungel; Hans Verhagen; Henk J van Kranen; Cathy J M Rompelberg; Costs and health effects of adding functional foods containing phytosterols/-stanols to statin therapy in the prevention of cardiovascular disease., Eur J Pharmacol , ; ():1879-0712",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Passive clinical case finding to identify subjects for treatment with statin therapy followed by addition of phytosterols/-stanols vs. Real-life consumption of phytosterols/-stanols,Not Stated,75 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,4.00,1.50,203000,Euro,2010,318870.25

8155,The cost-effectiveness of male HPV vaccination in the United States.,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of 12-year-old males to a female-only vaccination program for ages 12-26 years in the United States. METHODS: We used a simplified model of HPV transmission to estimate the reduction in the health and economic burden of HPV-associated diseases in males and females as a result of HPV vaccination. Estimates of the incidence, cost-per-case, and quality-of-life impact of HPV-associated health outcomes were based on the literature. The HPV-associated outcomes included were: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN); genital warts; juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP); and cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, oropharyngeal, and penile cancers. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of male vaccination depended on vaccine coverage of females. When including all HPV-associated outcomes in the analysis, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by adding male vaccination to a female-only vaccination program was $23,600 in the lower female coverage scenario (20% coverage at age 12 years) and $184,300 in the higher female coverage scenario (75% coverage at age 12 years). The cost-effectiveness of male vaccination appeared less favorable when compared to a strategy of increased female vaccination coverage. For example, we found that increasing coverage of 12-year-old girls would be more cost-effective than adding male vaccination even if the increased female vaccination strategy incurred program costs of $350 per additional girl vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination of 12-year-old males might potentially be cost-effective, particularly if female HPV vaccination coverage is low and if all potential health benefits of HPV vaccination are included in the analysis.

RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of male vaccination depended on vaccine coverage of females. When including all HPV-associated outcomes in the analysis, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by adding male vaccination to a female-only vaccination program was $23,600 in the lower female coverage scenario (20% coverage at age 12 years) and $184,300 in the higher female coverage scenario (75% coverage at age 12 years). The cost-effectiveness of male vaccination appeared less favorable when compared to a strategy of increased female vaccination coverage. For example, we found that increasing coverage of 12-year-old girls would be more cost-effective than adding male vaccination even if the increased female vaccination strategy incurred program costs of $350 per additional girl vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination of 12-year-old males might potentially be cost-effective, particularly if female HPV vaccination coverage is low and if all potential health benefits of HPV vaccination are included in the analysis.

8162,The cost-effectiveness of male HPV vaccination in the United States.,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination of 12-year-old males to a female-only vaccination program for ages 12-26 years in the United States. METHODS: We used a simplified model of HPV transmission to estimate the reduction in the health and economic burden of HPV-associated diseases in males and females as a result of HPV vaccination. Estimates of the incidence, cost-per-case, and quality-of-life impact of HPV-associated health outcomes were based on the literature. The HPV-associated outcomes included were: cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN); genital warts; juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP); and cervical, vaginal, vulvar, anal, oropharyngeal, and penile cancers.

8163,Early Prevention of Pressure Ulcers Among Elderly Patients Admitted Through Emergency Departments: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Every year, approximately 6.2 million hospital admissions through emergency departments (ED) involve elderly patients who are at risk of developing pressure ulcers. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pressure-redistribution foam mattresses on ED stretchers and beds for early prevention of pressure ulcers in elderly admitted ED patients. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we evaluated the incremental effectiveness (quality-adjusted life-days) and incremental cost (hospital and home care costs) between early prevention and current practice (with standard hospital mattresses) from a health care payer perspective during a 1-year time horizon. RESULTS: The projected incidence of ED-acquired pressure ulcers was 1.90% with current practice and 1.48% with early prevention, corresponding to a number needed to treat of 238 patients. The average upgrading cost from standard to pressure-redistribution mattresses was $0.30 per patient. Compared with current practice, early prevention was more effective, with 0.0015 quality-adjusted life-days gained, and less costly, with a mean cost saving of $32 per patient. If decisionmakers are willing to pay $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, early prevention was cost-effective even for short ED stay (ie, 1 hour), low hospital-acquired pressure ulcer risk (1% prevalence), and high unit price of pressure-redistribution mattresses ($3,775). Taking input uncertainty into account, early prevention was 81% likely to be cost-effective. Expected value-of-information estimates supported additional randomized controlled trials of pressure-redistribution mattresses to eliminate the remaining decision uncertainty. CONCLUSION: The economic evidence supports early prevention with pressure-redistribution foam mattresses in the ED. Early prevention is likely to improve health for elderly patients and save hospital costs.",2011-01-07773,21820208,Ann Emerg Med,Ba' Pham,2011,/,,No,21820208,"Ba' Pham; Laura Teague; James Mahoney; Laurie Goodman; Mike Paulden; Jeff Poss; Jianli Li; Luciano Ieraci; Steven Carcone; Murray Krahn; Early Prevention of Pressure Ulcers Among Elderly Patients Admitted Through Emergency Departments: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis., Ann Emerg Med, ; ():0196-0644",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early prevention of pressure ulcers with pressure-redistribution foam mattress on emergency departments bed and stretchers vs. Standard mattress,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-21333.33,Canada,2009,-22656.39
8164,An economic evaluation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening program in Italy.,"OBJECTIVES: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is defined as a localized dilatation of an aortic vessel. Though predominantly asymptomatic, it is a chronic degenerative condition associated with life-threatening risk of rupture. The early diagnosis of AAA, ie, before it ruptures, is therefore important; a simple, effective diagnostic method is ultrasound examination. To assess the benefit of screening in Italy, we developed a cost-effective Markov model comparing screening vs nonscreening scenarios. METHODS: A 13-health-states Markov model was developed to compare two cohorts of 65- to 75-year-old men: the first group undergoing screening for AAA by means of ultrasound (US), the second following the current practice of incidental detection. The following health states were distinguished: no AAA, unknown small AAA (3-3.9 cm), followed-up small AAA (1 year), unknown medium-sized AAA (4-4.9 cm), followed-up medium-sized AAA (6 months), unknown large AAA (>5 cm), elective repair, emergency repair, postelective-repair AAA, postemergency-repair AAA, rejected large AAA, and death. Transitions between health states were simulated by using 6-month cycles. Transition probabilities were derived from a literature review of relevant randomized controlled trial and from a screening program that is currently ongoing at San Martino Hospital in Genoa, Italy. The Italian National Health Service (NHS) perspective was adopted and incremental cost per life-year saved was calculated with a lifetime horizon; costs and health benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3% from year 2 onward. Uncertainty surrounding the model inputs was tested by means of univariate, multivariate, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Considering an attendance rate of 62%, the individual cost per invited subject was ?60 (US $83.2); 0.011 additional quality adjusted life years (QALY) were gained per patient in the screened cohort, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ?5673/QALY (US $7870/QALY). The results were sensitive to some parameter variations but consistent with the base case scenario. They suggest that on the basis of a willingness-to-pay threshold of ?50,000/QALY, screening for AAA is cost-effective, with a probability approaching 100%. CONCLUSIONS: As in economic evaluations developed in other countries, such as the UK, Canada, and The Netherlands, setting up a screening program for AAA can be considered cost-effective from the Italian NHS perspective.",2011-01-07775,21820837,J Vasc Surg,Stefano Giardina,2011,/,,No,21820837,"Stefano Giardina; Bianca Pane; Giovanni Spinella; Giuseppe Cafueri; Mara Corbo; Pascale Brasseur; Giovanni Orengo; Domenico Palombo; An economic evaluation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening program in Italy., J Vasc Surg, ; ():0741-5214",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening via ultrasound vs. Standard of care,Not Stated,75 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,7870,United States,2009,9494.13
8165,Cost-effectiveness of universal rotavirus vaccination in reducing rotavirus gastroenteritis in Ireland.,"We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of universal infant rotavirus (RV) vaccination compared to current standard of care of ""no vaccination"". Two RV vaccines are currently licensed in Ireland: Rotarix? and RotaTeq?. A cohort model used in several European countries was adapted using Irish epidemiological, resource utilisation and cost data. The base case model considers the impact of Rotarix vaccination on health-related quality of life of children under five years old from a healthcare payer perspective. Other scenarios explored the use of RotaTeq, impact on one caregiver, on societal costs and on cases that do not seek medical attention. Cost was varied between the vaccine list price (?100/course) in the base case and an assumed tender price (?70/course). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Implementing universal RV vaccination may prevent around 1970 GP visits, 3280 A&E attendances and 2490 hospitalisations. A vaccination programme was estimated to cost approximately ?6.54 million per year but ?4.65 million of this would be offset by reducing healthcare resource use. The baseline ICER was ?112,048/QALY and ?72,736/QALY from the healthcare payer and societal perspective, respectively, falling to ?68,896 and ?43,916/QALY, respectively, if the impact on one caregiver was considered. If the price fell to ?70 per course, universal RV vaccination would be cost saving under all scenarios.

8168,Cost effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in Greece: an analysis based on the CArdiac REsychronization in Heart Failure trial.,"Aims Health economic considerations have become increasingly important in healthcare. The aim of this study was to investigate the incremental cost effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) plus medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone in the Greek health-care system. Methods and results The health economic analysis was based on the CARE-HF trial, a randomized clinical trial estimating the efficacy of adding CRT (n = 409) to optimal pharmacological treatment (n = 404) in patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure with markers of cardiac dyssynchrony. Health care resource use from CArdiac REsychronization in Heart Failure was combined with costs for CRT implantation and hospitalization from publicly available sources. The analysis was based on a lifetime perspective, with the life expectancy estimated from the clinical trial data. Shorter time horizons were explored in the sensitivity analysis. The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with CRT was ?6 045 in Greece, with a 95% confidence interval for the cost-effectiveness ratio of ?4 292-9 411 per QALY gained. Conclusions The results of the economic evaluation of CRT in Greek health-care setting indicate that it is a cost-effective treatment compared with traditional pharmacological therapy. Cardiac resynchronization therapy can therefore be recommended for routine use in patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure and markers of dyssynchrony.",2011-01-07777,21821852,Europace,N Maniadakis,2011,/,,No,21821852,"N Maniadakis; M Ekman; M J Calvert; N Freemantle; M Karamalis; P Vardas; Cost effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in Greece: an analysis based on the CArdiac REsychronization in Heart Failure trial., Europace, ; ():1099-5129",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with medical therapy vs. Medical therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,6045,Euro,2011,9678.81
8169,Cost-utility analysis of levetiracetam and phenytoin for posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis.,"The standard for early posttraumatic brain injury (TBI) seizure prophylaxis is phenytoin. Despite its effectiveness, some argue for the use of newer antiepileptics (e.g., levetiracetam) because phenytoin requires close monitoring to maintain its therapeutic window and is associated with rare cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether phenytoin or levetiracetam would be more cost-effective in preventing early post-TBI seizures and reducing their negative impact on TBI outcomes.Cost-effectiveness analysis with the following base case assumptions: (1) phenytoin patients receive 1.0 g fosphenytoin load + 3 days of 100 mg three times a day (TID), have level drawn on day 3, ""therapeutic"" patients receive 100 mg TID on days 4 to 7, and ""subtherapeutic"" patients receive 200 mg TID on days 4 to 7; (2) levetiracetam patients receive 500 mg load + 7 days of 500 mg two times a day. Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores 4 to 5 represent good outcome, and GOS scores 2 to 3 represent poor outcome. Patients who develop early seizures: 40% good outcome, 50% poor outcome, and 10% death. Those who do not develop seizures: 75% good outcome, 20% poor outcome, and 5% death. Quality of life outcomes by GOS: good = 0.7, poor = 0.3, and death = 0.0. Severe adverse events and those impacting costs are rare for each agent. Assumptions were obtained through hospital query and exhaustive literature review.The cost of a 7-day course of fosphenytoin, phenytoin, and free phenytoin level was $37.50, whereas the cost of a 7-day course of levetiracetam was $480.00. Literature review noted phenytoin to be as effective as levetiracetam in preventing early post-TBI seizures (and more effective in subclinical seizures). Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were 23.6 for phenytoin and 23.2 for levetiracetam. As a result, the cost/effectiveness ratios were $1.58/QALY for phenytoin and $20.72/QALY for levetiracetam. All sensitivity analyses favored phenytoin unless levetiracetam prevented 100% of seizures and cost <$400 for 7-day course.Phenytoin is more cost-effective than levetiracetam at all reasonable prices and at all clinically plausible reductions in post-TBI seizure potential.",2011-01-07779,21825941,J Trauma,Bryan A Cotton,2011,71 /,375-9,No,21825941,"Bryan A Cotton; Lillian S Kao; Rosemary Kozar; John B Holcomb; Cost-utility analysis of levetiracetam and phenytoin for posttraumatic seizure prophylaxis., J Trauma, ; 71 ():0022-5282; 375-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Levetiractam vs. Phenytoin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Week,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1106.25,United States,2008,-1329.8

8179,Cost-effectiveness of memantine in moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease in Norway.,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of memantine for the treatment of moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease has been assessed in several European countries. Objective of the study was to assess it in Norwegian settings. METHODS: This cost-utility analysis used a Markov modelling approach to simulate the evolution of patients until their need for full-time care (FTC) over a 5-year period. FTC was defined as a patient becoming either dependent or institutionalised. Transition probabilities were estimated using a newly developed predictive equation of time to FTC. Health resource use and utilities were obtained from the Scandinavian Study of Cost and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease study, and mortality was obtained from the Oslo study. Memantine efficacy was based on a meta-analysis of six large trials. The model compared memantine with its alternative in this population, that is no pharmacological treatment or background therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The model underwent extensive sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In Norway, memantine was found to delay the need for FTC by 4.4?weeks compared with standard care and was associated with increased quality-adjusted life years. Memantine was the dominant strategy with cost savings of ?3739 (30?041 NOK) per patient. The probability of being the dominant strategy was 98.8%. This result was confirmed across multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The model suggests that memantine prolongs time to FTC for no additional cost to the healthcare system and society. It can be regarded as a cost-effective choice in the management of moderate and severe Alzheimer's disease.

8180,The cost-effectiveness of diagnostic management strategies for adults with minor head injury.,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic management strategies for adults with minor head injury. METHODS: A mathematical model was constructed to evaluate the incremental costs and effectiveness (Quality Adjusted Life years Gained, QALYs) of ten diagnostic management strategies for adults with minor head injuries. Secondary analyses were undertaken to determine the cost-effectiveness of hospital admission compared to discharge home and to explore the cost-effectiveness of strategies when no responsible adult was available to observe the patient after discharge. RESULTS: The apparent optimal strategy was based on the high and medium risk Canadian CT Head Rule (CCHRhm), although the costs and outcomes associated with each strategy were broadly similar. Hospital admission for patients with non-neurosurgical injury on CT dominated discharge home, whilst hospital admission for clinically normal patients with a normal CT was not cost-effective compared to discharge home with or without a responsible adult at ?39 and ?2.5 million per QALY, respectively. A selective CT strategy with discharge home if the CT scan was normal remained optimal compared to not investigating or CT scanning all patients when there was no responsible adult available to observe them after discharge. CONCLUSION: Our economic analysis confirms that the recent extension of access to CT scanning for minor head injury is appropriate. Liberal use of CT scanning based on a high sensitivity decision rule is not only effective but also cost-saving. The cost of CT scanning is very small compared to the estimated cost of caring for patients with brain injury worsened by delayed treatment. It is recommended therefore that all hospitals receiving patients with minor head injury should have unrestricted access to CT scanning for use in conjunction with evidence based guidelines. Provisionally the CCHRhm decision rule appears to be the best strategy although there is considerable uncertainty around the optimal decision rule. However, the CCHRhm rule appears to be the most widely validated and it therefore seems appropriate to conclude that the CCHRhm rule has the best evidence to support its use.",2011-01-07788,21835403,Injury,M W Holmes,2011,/,,No,21835403,"M W Holmes; S Goodacre; M D Stevenson; A Pandor; A Pickering; The cost-effectiveness of diagnostic management strategies for adults with minor head injury., Injury, ; ():1879-0267",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Canadian CT Head Rule high or medium risk (CCHRhm) vs. Scandinavian strategy,Not Stated,75 Years,75 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,10397,United Kingdom,2010,19050.65

8183,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a patient-centered care model for management of psoriasis.,"INTRODUCTION: Cost-effectiveness analyses help policymakers make informed decisions regarding funding allocation of health care resources. Cost-effectiveness analysis of technology-enabled models of health care delivery is necessary to assess sustainability of novel online, patient-centered health care models. OBJECTIVE: We sought to compare cost-effectiveness of conventional in-office care with a patient-centered, online model for follow-up treatment of patients with psoriasis. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal perspective on a randomized controlled trial comparing a patient-centered online model with in-office visits for treatment of patients with psoriasis during a 24-week period. Quality-adjusted life expectancy was calculated using the life table method. Costs were generated from the original study parameters and national averages for salaries and services. RESULTS: No significant difference existed in the mean change in Dermatology Life Quality Index scores between the two groups (online: 3.51 ? 4.48 and in-office: 3.88 ? 6.65, P value?= .79). Mean improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy was not significantly different between the groups (P value?= .93), with a gain of 0.447 ? 0.48 quality-adjusted life years for the online group and a gain of 0.463 ? 0.815 quality-adjusted life years for the in-office group. The cost of follow-up psoriasis care with online visits was 1.7?times less than the cost of in-person visits ($315 vs $576). LIMITATIONS: Variations in travel time existed among patients depending on their distance from the dermatologist's office. CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, the patient-centered online care model appears to be cost saving, while maintaining similar effectiveness to standard in-office care.",2011-01-07790,21835497,J Am Acad Dermatol,Kory Parsi,2011,/,,No,21835497,"Kory Parsi; Cindy J Chambers; April W Armstrong; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a patient-centered care model for management of psoriasis., J Am Acad Dermatol, ; ():0190-9622",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,In-office care model vs. Patient-centered online model (communicate directly with a dermatologist via online transmission),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,24 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,16318.75,United States,2009,19686.45
8184,Cost utility analysis based on a head-to-head Phase 3 trial comparing ustekinumab and etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: a Canadian perspective.,"A head-to-head comparator study has shown that the clinical efficacy of ustekinumab is superior to that of etanercept over a 12-week period in patients with psoriasis. Economic models are often hindered by the lack of trials directly comparing outcomes between relevant alternative therapies. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ustekinumab versus etanercept among adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis based on a Phase 3 head-to-head trial.The Markov model incorporates trial data from the Active Comparator (CNTO 1275/Enbrel) Psoriasis Trial study (ustekinumab 45 mg at Weeks 0 and 4; etanercept 50 mg biweekly) to follow patient response to initial treatment using the modeling approach developed by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination, University of York, and often cited by others conducting economic analyses of psoriasis. Beyond the initial trial period, the Canadian model extrapolates results up to 10 years.Over the 10-year time horizon of the model, the mean annual costs were $16,807 for ustekinumab (45 mg) and $19,525 for etanercept (50 mg). The incremental difference in costs and utilities remained in favour of ustekinumab across a range of sensitivity analyses.This model highlights the advantage of having head-to-head comparative trial data relevant to the at-risk population. Our model shows that ustekinumab is more cost-effective than etanercept for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.",2011-01-07792,21839402,Value Health,Feng Pan,0,14 /,652-6,Yes,21839402,"Feng Pan; Nicole C Brazier; Neil H Shear; Farah Jivraj; Brad Schenkel; Ruth Brown; Cost utility analysis based on a head-to-head Phase 3 trial comparing ustekinumab and etanercept in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis: a Canadian perspective., Value Health, ; 14 ():1098-3015; 652-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ustekinumab (2 doses at 45mg) vs. Etanercept (50mg twice weeky),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,-590869.56,Canada,2009,-627514.13
8185,Cost-effectiveness of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor pairs in efavirenz-based regimens for treatment-na?ve adults with HIV infection in the United States.,"To estimate the cost-effectiveness of once-daily tenofovir/emtricitabine compared with twice-daily zidovudine/lamivudine and once-daily abacavir/lamivudine in treatment-na?ve adults with HIV-1 infection in the United States.A Markov model with four therapy lines and six health states based on CD4(+) cell-count ranges was developed to estimate lifetime costs and health outcomes. Efficacy data (virologic response and CD4(+) cell-count changes) for first-line therapy were from 144-week results of Study 934 comparing tenofovir/emtricitabine with zidovudine/lamivudine and 48-week results of Study CNA30024 comparing abacavir/lamivudine with zidovudine/lamivudine, all in combination with efavirenz. Data from Study CNA30024 for abacavir/lamivudine were adjusted to allow for an indirect comparison with tenofovir/emtricitabine. Subsequent therapy lines were based on likely baskets of antiretroviral therapy recommended by US treatment guidelines. Utility values, mortality rates, and costs (2009 US dollars) were obtained from published sources.

Interferon-? release assays are new alternatives to the tuberculin skin test for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, with higher specificity than the tuberculin skin test and without cross-reactivity with the Bacille Calmette-Gu?rin vaccine. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of employee TB screening using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) versus CXR. METHODS: Markov models were constructed. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of immunocompetent 40-year-old individuals, using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon.

8190,Cost-effectiveness of supervised exercise therapy in heart failure patients.,"Exercise therapy in heart failure (HF) patients is considered safe and has demonstrated modest reduction in hospitalization rates and death in recent trials. Previous cost-effectiveness analysis described favorable results considering long-term supervised exercise intervention and significant effectiveness of exercise therapy; however, these evidences are now no longer supported. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of supervised exercise therapy in HF patients under the perspective of the Brazilian Public Healthcare System.We developed a Markov model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of supervised exercise therapy compared to standard treatment in patients with New York Heart Association HF class II and III. Effectiveness was evaluated in quality-adjusted life years in a 10-year time horizon. We searched PUBMED for published clinical trials to estimate effectiveness, mortality, hospitalization, and utilities data. Treatment costs were obtained from published cohort updated to 2008 values. Exercise therapy intervention costs were obtained from a rehabilitation center. Model robustness was assessed through Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis. Cost were expressed as international dollars, applying the purchasing-power-parity conversion rate.Exercise therapy showed small reduction in hospitalization and mortality at a low cost, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Int$26,462/quality-adjusted life year. Results were more sensitive to exercise therapy costs, standard treatment total costs, exercise therapy effectiveness, and medications costs. Considering a willingness-to-pay of Int$27,500, 55% of the trials fell below this value in the Monte Carlo simulation.In a Brazilian scenario, exercise therapy shows reasonable cost-effectiveness ratio, despite current evidence of limited benefit of this intervention.",2011-01-07795,21839879,Value Health,Eduardo M K?hr,0,14 /,S100-7,Yes,21839879,"Eduardo M K?hr; Rodrigo A Ribeiro; Luis Eduardo P Rohde; Carisi A Polanczyk; Cost-effectiveness of supervised exercise therapy in heart failure patients., Value Health, ; 14 ():1098-3015; S100-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Supervised exercise therapy with physiotherapist vs. Standard of care,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,26461,United States,2008,31808.19

Conclusions: Varenicline in addition to counselling is cost-effective compared to placebo and counselling in smokers with CVD.",2011-01-07800,21840967,Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil,Koo Wilson,2011,/,,No,21840967,"Koo Wilson; Robert Hettle; Sophie Marbaix; Silvia Diaz Cerezo; Monica Ines; Laura Santoni; Lieven Annemans; Jacques Prignot; Esteban Lopez de Sa; An economic evaluation based on a randomized placebo-controlled trial of varenicline in smokers with cardiovascular disease: results for Belgium, Spain, Portugal, and Italy., Eur J Cardiovasc Prev Rehabil, ; ():1741-8267",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Varenicline plus counselling vs. Placebo plus counselling,Not Stated,Not Stated,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,5433,Euro,2010,8534.1
8198,Is Hip Arthroscopy Cost-effective for Femoroacetabular Impingement?,"BACKGROUND: The impact of hip arthroscopy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among younger patients with symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is unknown, but with increasing recognition of the condition there is likely to be increasing demand for arthroscopy. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We describe an approach to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of hip arthroscopy compared with observation in patients with FAI; we also identified variables that influence its cost-effectiveness. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov model including possible health states for 36-year-old patients with FAI using decision analysis software and compared two strategies: (1) observation and (2) hip arthroscopy, followed by THA with disease progression. We estimated the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental benefit (reflected by HRQoL) of both strategies. We identified studies reporting Harris hip scores and complications after arthroscopy to estimate health state preferences and their probabilities. We performed sensitivity analyses on 30 input variables over a plausible range of estimates to determine the influence of uncertainty on the ICER with particular emphasis on the magnitude and duration of benefit. RESULTS: Among patients with FAI but no radiographic evidence of arthritis, the estimated ICER of hip arthroscopy was $21,700/QALY while the ICER for patients with preoperative arthritis was $79,500/QALY. Alteration of the natural history of arthritis by hip arthroscopy improved the ICER to $19,200/QALY and resulted in cost savings if THA was not performed until at least 16?years after arthroscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by available data, our model suggests hip arthroscopy in patients with FAI without arthritis may result in a favorable ICER compared with other health interventions considered cost-effective. Further studies of hip arthroscopy are needed to determine the impact on quality of life, duration of symptomatic relief, and the effect on the need for subsequent THA.",2011-01-07801,21842295,Clin Orthop,David W Shearer,2011,/,,No,21842295,"David W Shearer; Jonathan Kramer; Kevin J Bozic; Brian T Feeley; Is Hip Arthroscopy Cost-effective for Femoroacetabular Impingement?, Clin Orthop, ; ():0009-921X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hip arthroscopy followed by total joint arthroplasty (THA) vs. None,Not Stated,36 Years,36 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,21700,United States,2010,25755.76

8200,Clinical and Economic Outcomes of Liberal Versus Selective Drug-Eluting Stent Use: Insights From Temporal Analysis of the Multicenter Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events (EVENT) Registry.,"Background- Although the benefits of drug-eluting stents (DES) for reducing restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention are well established, the impact of alternative rates of DES use on population-level outcomes is unknown. Methods and Results- We used data from the Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events (EVENT) registry to examine the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of varying DES use rates in routine care. Between 2004 and 2007, 10 144 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention were enrolled in the EVENT registry at 55 US centers. Clinical outcomes and cardiovascular-specific costs were assessed prospectively over 1 year of follow-up. Use of DES decreased from 92 in 2004 to 2006 (liberal use era; n=7587) to 68 in 2007 (selective use era; n=2557; P<0.001). One-year rates of death or myocardial infarction were similar in both eras. Over this time period, the incidence of target lesion revascularization increased from 4.1 to 5.1, an absolute increase of 1.0 (95 confidence interval, 0.1 to 1.9; P=0.03), whereas total cardiovascular costs per patient decreased by $401 (95 confidence interval, 131 to 671; P=0.004). The risk-adjusted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the liberal versus selective DES era was $16 000 per target lesion revascularization event avoided, $27 000 per repeat revascularization avoided, and $433 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Conclusions- In this prospective registry, a temporal reduction in DES use was associated with a small increase in target lesion revascularization and a modest reduction in total cardiovascular costs. These findings suggest that although clinical outcomes are marginally better with unrestricted DES use, this approach represents a relatively inefficient use of healthcare resources relative to several common benchmarks for cost-effective care.",2011-01-07802,21844081,Circulation,Lakshmi Venkitachalam,2011,124 /,1028-1037,No,21844081,"Lakshmi Venkitachalam; Yang Lei; Joshua M Stolker; Elizabeth M Mahoney; Amit P Amin; Jason B Lindsey; Kevin F Kennedy; Michael J Pencina; John J Lopez; Neal S Kleiman; David J Cohen; EVENT Registry Investigators; Clinical and Economic Outcomes of Liberal Versus Selective Drug-Eluting Stent Use: Insights From Temporal Analysis of the Multicenter Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events (EVENT) Registry., Circulation, ; 124 ():0009-7322; 1028-1037",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Liberal use of drug eluting stents vs. Selective use of drug eluting stents,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,433000,United States,2007,540484.62
