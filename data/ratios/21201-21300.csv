21201,The cost effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori population screening-economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial with 13-year follow-up,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori eradication improves dyspeptic symptoms in 8%-10%, prevents peptic ulcer and may reduce the risk of gastric cancer. Availability of a high quality diagnostic test and an effective treatment makes population screening and eradication of Helicobacter pylori an attractive option. AIM: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori population screening and eradication. METHODS: Cost effectiveness analysis and cost utility analysis alongside randomised controlled trial with 13 years follow-up. The evaluation has a societal perspective. A random general population sample of 20 011 individuals aged 40-65 were randomised and invited in 1998-1999; 12 530 were enrolled and, of these, 8658 have been successfully followed up at 1, 5, and 13 years after intervention. Questionnaires included the quality of life instrument SF-36. From SF-36 responses an SF-6D score was derived and used for calculation of quality-adjusted life years. Register data on costs, use of health care resources and medication were obtained for all randomised individuals. The intervention was an invitation to Helicobacter pylori screening by in-office blood test; positive tests were validated by (13) C-urea breath test. Those who tested positive were offered eradication therapy. Main outcome measures were Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year and life-years gained. RESULTS: Helicobacter pylori population screening and eradication with 13 years follow-up was not effective in regards to quality of life and the cost per screened person was higher than not screening (mean difference 11 269 DKK [95% CI: 3175-19 362]). The probability of being cost-effective was 80% at a threshold of 400 000 DKK (approximately 53,800 Euros) of willingness-to-pay per life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Helicobacter pylori population screening and eradication with 13 years follow-up was not effective in regards to quality of life and the cost of screening was higher than not screening.",2019-01-30171,30854700,Aliment Pharmacol Ther,Maria Bomme Hogh,2019,49 / 8,1013-1025,No,30854700,"Maria Bomme Hogh; Christian Kronborg; Jane Moller Hansen; Ove B Schaffalitzky de Muckadell; The cost effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori population screening-economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial with 13-year follow-up, Aliment Pharmacol Ther, 2019 Apr; 49(8):0269-2813; 1013-1025",QALY,Denmark,Not Stated,Screening,helicobacter pylori screening vs. None,Not Stated,65 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,4.00,4.00,-563450,Denmark,2014,-109732.68
21202,Cost Effectiveness of Endoscopic Resection vs Transanal Resection of Complex Benign Rectal Polyps,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Complex benign rectal polyps can be managed with transanal surgery or with endoscopic resection (ER). Though the complication rate after ER is lower than transanal surgery, recurrence is higher. Patients lost to follow up after ER might therefore be at increased risk for rectal cancer. We evaluated the costs, benefits, and cost effectiveness of ER compared to 2 surgical techniques for removing complex rectal polyps, using a 50-year time horizon-this allowed us to capture rates of cancer development among patients lost from follow-up surveillance. METHODS: We created a Markov model to simulate the lifetime outcomes and costs of ER, transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), and transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) for the management of a complex benign rectal polyp. We assessed the effect of surveillance by allowing a portion of the patients to be lost to follow up. We calculated the cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or each intervention over a 50-year time horizon. RESULTS: We found that TEM was slightly more effective than TAMIS and ER (TEM, 19.54 QALYs; TAMIS, 19.53 QALYs; and ER19.53, QALYs), but ER had a lower lifetime discounted cost (ER cost $7161, TEM cost $10,459, and TAMIS cost $11,253). TEM was not cost effective compared to ER, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $485,333/QALY. TAMIS was ruled out by extended dominance. TEM became cost effective when the mortality from ER exceeded 0.63%, or if loss to follow up exceeded 25.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Using a Markov model, we found that ER, TEM, and TAMIS have similar effectiveness, but ER is less expensive, in management of benign rectal polyps.

21204,Cost Effectiveness of Limited Vitrectomy for Vision Degrading Myodesopsia,"PURPOSE: Patients afflicted with clinically significant vitreous floaters suffer from Vision Degrading Myopdesopsia, characterized by impairments in contrast sensitivity function (CSF) and decreased quality-of-life. This study determined the cost-utility of limited vitrectomy for this condition. DESIGN: Retrospective, interventional case series and third party insurer cost-utility analysis. METHODS: Sixty-seven patients suffering from unilateral vitreous floaters [20 non-myopes with posterior vitreous detachment (PVD); 17 myopes (>-2D) without PVD; 30 myopes with PVD] completed the NEI Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-39) and were tested with best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and contrast sensitivity function (CSF) measurements before and after limited vitrectomy. A reference case cost-utility analysis was performed. RESULTS: The mean VFQ-39 increased 19% (p<0.00001) after surgery, with general vision improving 27% for the entire group and 37% for non-myopic PVD (p<0.00001 for each). VFQ-39 correlations with time tradeoff utilities indicated a 14.4% improvement in quality-of-life. Mean BCVA improved 13.5% post-operatively (p<0.00001) and CSF improved 53% (p<0.00001). The incremental patient value gain conferred by limited vitrectomy was 2.38 QALYs, and the average cost-utility ratio in 2018 U.S. real dollars was $1,574/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Limited vitrectomy for Vision Degrading Myodesopsia is clinically effective, in that it improves BCVA, CSF, and patient well-being. It is also highly cost-effective ($1,574/QALY), with an average cost-utility ratio versus no therapy that is superior to cataract surgery ($2,262/QALY), amblyopia therapy ($2,710/QALY), and retinal detachment repair ($45,304/QALY).

21205,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of palbociclib or ribociclib in the treatment of advanced hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer","PURPOSE: Three CDK4/6 inhibitors, palbociclib (PAL), ribociclib (RIB), and abemaciclib, when combined with letrozole (LET), have been approved as first-line therapy for postmenopausal women with metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer. However, an economic evaluation of these newer therapies is currently lacking. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PAL or RIB for the treatment of advanced HR+, HER2- breast cancer in the United States. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was constructed using data from published clinical trials evaluating PAL and RIB. Three simulated treatment strategies included PAL + LET, RIB + LET, or LET alone. The main outcome measures were simulated progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Simulated median OS was 38.9 months for PAL + LET and 33.0 months for LET alone. Simulated median OS for RIB + LET was 43.3 months. Compared to LET alone, PAL + LET provided an additional 0.48 QALYs, on average, with an ICER of $634,000 per QALY gained; RIB + LET provided an additional 0.86 QALYs, on average, with an ICER of $440,000 per QALY gained. At current prices, neither PAL nor RIB was cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained. To reach such a cost-effectiveness threshold, PAL and RIB prices must decrease by approximately 70%.

21210,Cost-effectiveness of Screening for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma among Asian American Men in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: Most patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the United States are diagnosed with stage III-IV disease. Screening for NPC in endemic areas results in earlier detection and improved outcomes. We examined the cost-effectiveness of screening for NPC with plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA among Asian American men in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: We used a Markov cohort model to estimate discounted life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for screening as compared with usual care without screening. SETTING: The base case analysis considered onetime screening for 50-year-old Asian American men. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Confirmatory testing was magnetic resonance imaging and nasopharyngoscopy. Cancer-specific outcomes, health utility values, and costs were determined from cancer registries and the published literature. RESULTS: For Asian American men, usual care without screening resulted in the detection of NPC at stages I, II, III-IVB, and IVC among 6%, 29%, 54%, and 11% of those with cancer, respectively, whereas screening resulted in earlier detection with a stage distribution of 43%, 24%, 32%, and 1%. This corresponded to an additional 0.00055 QALYs gained at a cost of $63 per person: an incremental cost of $113,341 per QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, screening Asian American men was cost-effective at $100,000 per QALY gained in 35% of samples. CONCLUSION: Although screening for NPC with plasma Epstein-Barr virus DNA for 50-year-old Asian American men may result in earlier detection, in this study it was unlikely to be cost-effective.

21211,Value-based Pricing for Rifaximin Increases Access of Patients With Irritable Bowel Syndrome With Diarrhea to Therapy,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Increasing drug prices lead to payer coverage restrictions, which access limit to therapy. We assessed the cost effectiveness of rifaximin in management of patients with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) under common payer coverage restrictions and determined the maximum price at which rifaximin would be cost effective using contemporary cost-effectiveness thresholds. METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed to evaluate quality of life, cost, and cost effectiveness of rifaximin for patients with IBS-D and complete noncoverage (insurer pays none of the drug cost), unrestricted access (insurer pays 100% of the drug cost), and formulary-restricted access (insurer pays 100% of the drug cost after for patients failed by initial therapy). The maximum cost-effective drug price was determined for each level of drug coverage using threshold analysis adjusted for willingness to pay thresholds from $50,000 to $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Analysis was performed from a payer perspective with a 1-year time horizon. RESULTS: Unrestricted and formulary-restricted access were more effective than complete non-coverage, resulting in additional 0.03 and 0.05 QALYs gained over noncoverage. However, unrestricted and formulary-restricted coverage were more expensive. At current drug prices, unrestricted or formulary-restricted coverage would cost an additional $171,850 or $1,207,136/QALY gained, compared to complete non-coverage.

21219,Compression Stockings for the Prevention of Venous Leg Ulcer Recurrence: A Health Technology Assessment,"Background: People with chronic venous insufficiency who develop leg ulcers face a difficult condition to treat. Venous leg ulcers may persist for long periods of time and have a negative impact on quality of life. Treatment requires frequent health care provider visits, creating a substantial burden across health care settings.The objective of this health technology assessment was to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, budget impact, and patient experiences of compression stockings for prevention of venous leg ulcer recurrence. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify randomized trials and observational studies examining the effectiveness of compression stockings in reducing the risk of recurrence of venous leg ulcers after healing and/or reported on the quality of life for patients and any adverse events from the wearing of compression stockings. We performed a literature search to identify studies and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.We conducted a cost-utility analysis with a 5-year time horizon from the perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. We compared compression stockings to usual care (no compression stockings) and simulated a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old patients with healed venous ulcers, using a Markov model. Model input parameters were obtained primarily from the published literature. In addition, we used Ontario costing sources and consultation with clinical experts. We estimated quality-adjusted life years gained and direct medical costs. We conducted sensitivity analyses and a budget impact analysis to estimate the additional costs required to publicly fund compression stockings in Ontario. All costs are presented in 2018 Canadian dollars.We spoke to people who recently began using compression stockings and those who have used them for many years to gain an understanding of their day-to-day experience with the management of chronic venous insufficiency and compression stockings. Results: One randomized controlled trial reported that the recurrence rate was significantly lower at 12 months in people who were assigned to the compression stocking group compared with people assigned to the control group (risk ratio 0.43, 95% CI, 0.27-0.69; P = .001) (GRADE: Moderate). Three randomized controlled trials reported no significant difference in recurrence rates between the levels of pressure. One randomized controlled trial also reported that the risk of recurrence was six times higher in those who did not adhere to compression stockings than in those who did adhere. One single-arm cohort study showed that the recurrence rate was considerably higher in people who did not adhere or had poor adherence (79%) compared with those who adhered to compression stockings (4%).Compared with usual care, compression stockings were associated with higher costs and with increased quality-adjusted life years. We estimated that, on average, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of compression stockings was $27,300 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared to no compression stockings. There was some uncertainty in our results, but most simulations (> 70%) showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained below $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We estimated that the annual budget impact of funding compression stockings would range between $0.95 million and $3.19 million per year over the next five years.People interviewed commonly reported that chronic venous insufficiency had a substantial impact on their day-to-day lives. There were social impacts from the difficulty or inability to walk and emotional impacts from the loss of independence and fear of ulcer recurrence. There were barriers to the wearing of compression stockings, including replacement cost and the difficulty of putting them on; however, most people interviewed reported that using compression stockings improved their condition and their quality of life. Conclusions: The available evidence shows that, compared with usual care, compression stockings are effective in preventing venous leg ulcer recurrence and likely to be cost-effective. In people with a healed venous leg ulcer, wearing compression stockings helps to reduce the risk of recurrence by about half. Publicly funding compression stockings for people with venous leg ulcers would result in additional costs to the Ontario health care system over the next 5 years. Despite concerns about cost and the daily chore of wearing compression stockings, most people interviewed felt that compression stockings provided important benefits through reduction of swelling and prevention of recurrence.",2019-01-30231,30828407,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,Health Quality Ontario,2019,19 / 2,1-86,No,30828407,"Health Quality Ontario; Compression Stockings for the Prevention of Venous Leg Ulcer Recurrence: A Health Technology Assessment, Ont Health Technol Assess Ser, 2019; 19(2):1915-7398; 1-86",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Medical Device,compression stockings vs. Standard/Usual Care- No compression stocking,"healed venous ulcers at risk of ulcer recurrence; no significant arterial disease, rheumatoid disease, or diabetes mellitus",65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,1.50,1.50,27300,Canada,2018,21716.58
21220,Cost-effectiveness of first-line versus delayed use of combination dapagliflozin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes,"The present study sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of first-line (immediate) versus delayed use of combination dapagliflozin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes, from the perspective of the Australian healthcare system. We developed a Markov model to simulate the progress of subjects with type 2 diabetes. Decision analysis was applied to assess the cost-effectiveness of first-line combination dapagliflozin and metformin versus first-line metformin monotherapy followed by gradual addition of dapagliflozin over time. Transition probabilities, costs (in Australian dollars) and utility data were derived from published sources. All costs, years of life lived and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) lived were discounted at an annual rate of 5%. Over a 20-year model period, first-line use of combination dapagliflozin and metformin was predicted to reduce the onset of hospitalisation of heart failure, cardiovascular deaths and all cause deaths by 5.5%, 57.6% and 29.6%, respectively. An additional 2.5 years of life (discounted) and 1.9 QALYs (discounted) would be gained per patient, at a cost of AUD $23,367 (discounted) per person. These figures equated to AUD $9,535 per years of life saved (YoLS) and AUD $12,477 per QALYs saved. Sensitivity analyses indicated the results to be robust.

21221,Cognitive-behavioural therapy for clozapine-resistant schizophrenia: the FOCUS RCT,"BACKGROUND: Clozapine (clozaril, Mylan Products Ltd) is a first-choice treatment for people with schizophrenia who have a poor response to standard antipsychotic medication. However, a significant number of patients who trial clozapine have an inadequate response and experience persistent symptoms, called clozapine-resistant schizophrenia (CRS). There is little evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of pharmacological or psychological interventions for this population. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for people with CRS and to identify factors predicting outcome. DESIGN: The Focusing on Clozapine Unresponsive Symptoms (FOCUS) trial was a parallel-group, randomised, outcome-blinded evaluation trial. Randomisation was undertaken using permuted blocks of random size via a web-based platform. Data were analysed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis, using random-effects regression adjusted for site, age, sex and baseline symptoms. Cost-effectiveness analyses were carried out to determine whether or not CBT was associated with a greater number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and higher costs than treatment as usual (TAU). SETTING: Secondary care mental health services in five cities in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: People with CRS aged >/= 16 years, with an International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) schizophrenia spectrum diagnoses and who are experiencing psychotic symptoms. INTERVENTIONS: Individual CBT included up to 30 hours of therapy delivered over 9 months. The comparator was TAU, which included care co-ordination from secondary care mental health services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at 21 months and the primary secondary outcome was PANSS total score at the end of treatment (9 months post randomisation). The health benefit measure for the economic evaluation was the QALY, estimated from the EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version (EQ-5D-5L), health status measure. Service use was measured to estimate costs. RESULTS: Participants were allocated to CBT (n = 242) or TAU (n = 245). There was no significant difference between groups on the prespecified primary outcome [PANSS total score at 21 months was 0.89 points lower in the CBT arm than in the TAU arm, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.32 to 1.55 points; p = 0.475], although PANSS total score at the end of treatment (9 months) was significantly lower in the CBT arm (-2.40 points, 95% CI -4.79 to -0.02 points; p = 0.049). CBT was associated with a net cost of pound5378 (95% CI - pound13,010 to pound23,766) and a net QALY gain of 0.052 (95% CI 0.003 to 0.103 QALYs) compared with TAU. The cost-effectiveness acceptability analysis indicated a low likelihood that CBT was cost-effective, in the primary and sensitivity analyses (probability < 50%). In the CBT arm, 107 participants reported at least one adverse event (AE), whereas 104 participants in the TAU arm reported at least one AE (odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.46; p = 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive-behavioural therapy for CRS was not superior to TAU on the primary outcome of total PANSS symptoms at 21 months, but was superior on total PANSS symptoms at 9 months (end of treatment). CBT was not found to be cost-effective in comparison with TAU. There was no suggestion that the addition of CBT to TAU caused adverse effects. Future work could investigate whether or not specific therapeutic techniques of CBT have value for some CRS individuals, how to identify those who may benefit and how to ensure that effects on symptoms can be sustained.

21222,Cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency,"Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a condition that often results in severe infections and death at young age. Early detection shortly after birth, followed by treatment before infections occur, largely increases the chances of survival. As the incidence of SCID is low, assessing cost-effectiveness of adding screening for SCID to the newborn screening program is relevant for decision making. Lifetime costs and effects of newborn screening for SCID were compared to a situation without screening in the Netherlands in a decision analysis model. Model parameters were based on literature and expert opinions. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Due to earlier detection, the number of deaths due to SCID per 100,000 children was assessed to decrease from 0.57 to 0.23 and a number of 11.7 quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was expected. Total yearly healthcare costs, including costs of screening, diagnostics, and treatment, were euro390,800 higher in a situation with screening compared to a situation without screening, resulting in a cost-utility ratio of euro33,400 per QALY gained.Conclusion: Newborn screening for SCID might be cost-effective. However, there is still a lot of uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness estimate. Pilot screening projects are warranted to obtain more accurate estimates for the European situation. What is Known: * Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a condition that often results in severe infections and death at a young age. * As the incidence of SCID is low, assessing cost-effectiveness of adding screening for SCID to the newborn screening program is needed. What is New: * Newborn screening for SCID is expected to reduce mortality from 0.57 to 0.23 per 100,000 children at additional healthcare costs of euro390,800. The cost-utility ratio is euro33,400 per QALY gained. * Due to large uncertainty around cost-effectiveness estimates, pilot screening projects are warranted for Europe.",2019-01-30275,30805731,Eur J Pediatr,Catharina P B Van der Ploeg,2019,178 / 5,721-729,No,30805731,"Catharina P B Van der Ploeg; Maartje Blom; Robbert G M Bredius; Mirjam van der Burg; Peter C J I Schielen; Paul H Verkerk; M Elske van den Akker-van Marle; Cost-effectiveness of newborn screening for severe combined immunodeficiency, Eur J Pediatr, 2019 May; 178(5):1432-1076; 721-729",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Screening,severe combined immunodeficiency screening vs. None,Newborn,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,33400,Euro,2016,39854.77
21223,Cost-Utility of a Two-Dose Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Programme Added to Cervical Cancer Screening Compared with Cervical Cancer Screening Alone in Korea,"Background: Cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus and is a leading cause of cancer death among young Korean women. Current screening programmes could benefit from the addition of HPV vaccination into their schedule to help reduce disease burden. Two-dose vaccination schedules targeting HPV types 16 and 18, which are responsible for most cervical cancer cases, have recently been approved. Of the two available vaccines, AS04-adjuvanted HPV16/18 vaccine (AS04-HPV16/18v) provides greater protection against non-vaccine oncogenic HPV, while HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine (4vHPVv) provides protection against genital warts. Methods: The health and economic consequences of introducing a two-dose HPV vaccination programme in 12-year-old girls together with screening were assessed in the Korean healthcare setting using a previously-published Markov model. Results: Compared with screening alone, AS04-HPV16/18v was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio below and within the Korean Won [KRW] 20-30 million treshold). When comparing the two vaccines, at 3% discount rate, AS04-HPV16/18v dominated 4vHPVv (i.e., provided 174 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 304 more life-years (LYs) and cost-savings of KRW 980 million). At a 5% discount rate, AS04-HPV16/18v provided comparable QALYs (albeit 5 fewer), 105 more LYs and cost-savings of KRW 292 million compared with 4vHPVv. Results were particularly sensitive to the discount rate used, as the health benefits of preventing cervical cancer are observed much later than those of preventing genital warts. Conclusion: For the Korean setting, HPV vaccination with a two-dose schedule is a cost-effective option, and AS04-HPV16/18v is likely to offer better health outcomes at a cost-saving compared with 4vHPVv.",2019-01-30281,30803204,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Hyunju Lee,2019,20 / 2,425-435,No,30803204,"Hyunju Lee; Sooyoung Hur; Hyeongap Jang; I-Heng Lee; Woo Yun Sohn; Georges Van Kriekinge; Byoung-Gie Kim; Cost-Utility of a Two-Dose Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Programme Added to Cervical Cancer Screening Compared with Cervical Cancer Screening Alone in Korea, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, 2019 Feb 26; 20(2):1513-7368; 425-435",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,"Immunization, Screening",two-dose as04-hpv16/18v + cervical cancer screening vs. Standard/Usual Care- Cervical Cancer Screening,no HPV,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,23893114,Korea,2014,23924.3

Weight loss can be an effective treatment for obesity and may slow the progression of advanced liver disease. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation study used a Markov-based state-transition model to simulate the benefits and risks of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GB), and intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) compared with usual care in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis and varying baseline weight (overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe obesity). Patients faced varied risks of perioperative mortality and complications depending on the type of surgery they underwent. Data were collected on March 22, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (in 2017 $US), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: Demographic characteristics of the patient population were based on a previously published prospective study (n = 161). Patients in the model were 41.0% female, and the base case age was 54 years. Compared with usual care, SG was associated with an increase in QALYs of 0.263 to 1.180 (bounds of ranges represent overweight to severe obesity); GB, 0.263 to 1.207; and ILI, 0.004 to 0.216. Sleeve gastrectomy was also associated with an increase in life-years of 0.693 to 1.930; GB, 0.694 to 1.947; and ILI, 0.012 to 0.114. With usual care, expected life-years in overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe obesity were 12.939, 11.949, 10.976, and 10.095, respectively. With usual care, QALY in overweight was 6.418; mild obesity, 5.790; moderate obesity, 5.186; and severe obesity, 4.577. Sleeve gastrectomy was the most cost-effective option for patients across all weight classes assessed: ICER for SG in patients with overweight was $66119 per QALY; mild obesity, $18716 per QALY; moderate obesity, $10274 per QALY; and severe obesity, $6563 per QALY. A threshold analysis on the procedure cost of GB found that for GB to be cost-effective, the cost of the surgery must be decreased from its baseline value of $28 734 by $4889 for mild obesity, by $3189 for moderate obesity, and by $2289 for severe obesity. In overweight patients, GB involved fewer QALYs than SG, and thus decreasing the cost of surgery would not result in cost-effectiveness.

Weight loss can be an effective treatment for obesity and may slow the progression of advanced liver disease. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic evaluation study used a Markov-based state-transition model to simulate the benefits and risks of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (GB), and intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) compared with usual care in patients with NASH and compensated cirrhosis and varying baseline weight (overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe obesity). Patients faced varied risks of perioperative mortality and complications depending on the type of surgery they underwent. Data were collected on March 22, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (in 2017 $US), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: Demographic characteristics of the patient population were based on a previously published prospective study (n = 161). Patients in the model were 41.0% female, and the base case age was 54 years. Compared with usual care, SG was associated with an increase in QALYs of 0.263 to 1.180 (bounds of ranges represent overweight to severe obesity); GB, 0.263 to 1.207; and ILI, 0.004 to 0.216.

21237,Long-term Survival and Cost-effectiveness Associated With Axicabtagene Ciloleucel vs Chemotherapy for Treatment of B-Cell Lymphoma,"Importance: Axicabtagene ciloleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, represents a new and potentially curative treatment option for B-cell lymphoma. It is expected to have long-term survival benefits; however, long-term survival data are limited. Objective: To estimate the long-term survival and cost-effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel for treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. Design, Setting, and Participants: Economic evaluation study using a survival analysis that digitized and extrapolated survival curves published in the ZUMA-1 trial (Safety and Efficacy of KTE-C19 in Adults With Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma), which enrolled patients between November 2015 and September 2016 and had a maximum follow-up of 24 months. Five different survival models (standard parametric, flexible parametric, 2 mixture cure models, and a flexible parametric mixture model) were used to extrapolate the survival curves to a lifetime horizon from January through June 2018. A cost-effectiveness analysis, from both a trial-based and lifetime horizon, was also conducted to inform the value of this novel therapy. The model was based on data from 111 patients with B-cell lymphoma who were enrolled in the ZUMA-1 trial. Interventions: One-time administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with chemotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Undiscounted and discounted life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs, and incremental costs per LY and QALY gained. Results: The modeled cohort of 111 patients started at 58 years of age. At the end of the trial, treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel resulted in 0.48 more LYs and 0.34 more QALYs than chemotherapy, producing a cost-effectiveness estimate of $896600 per QALY for public payers and $1615000 per QALY for commercial payers. Extrapolated long-term survival for patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel ranged from 2.83 to 9.19 discounted LYs and from 2.07 to 7.62 discounted QALYs. Incrementally, treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel was associated with 1.89 to 5.82 discounted LYs and 1.52 to 4.90 discounted QALYs vs chemotherapy. With the use of these incremental estimates of survival, cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from $82400 to $230900 per QALY gained for public payers and from $100400 to $289000 per QALY gained for commercial payers. Conclusions and Relevance: Treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel appears to be associated with incremental gains in survival over chemotherapy.

21242,Economic modeling of risk-adapted screen-and-treat strategies in women at high risk for breast or ovarian cancer,"BACKGROUND: The ''German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer'' (GC-HBOC) offers women with a family history of breast and ovarian cancer genetic counseling. The aim of this modeling study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of genetic testing for BRCA 1/2 in women with a high familial risk followed by different preventive interventions (intensified surveillance, risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy, risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or both mastectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy) compared to no genetic test. METHODS: A Markov model with a lifelong time horizon was developed for a cohort of 35-year-old women with a BRCA 1/2 mutation probability of >/= 10%. The perspective of the German statutory health insurance (SHI) was adopted. The model included the health states ''well'' (women with increased risk), ''breast cancer without metastases'', ''breast cancer with metastases'', ''ovarian cancer'', ''death'', and two post (non-metastatic) breast or ovarian cancer states. Outcomes were costs, quality of life years gained (QALYs) and life years gained (LYG). Important data used for the model were obtained from 4380 women enrolled in the GC-HBOC. RESULTS: Compared with the no test strategy, genetic testing with subsequent surgical and non-surgical treatment options provided to women with deleterious BRCA 1 or 2 mutations resulted in additional costs of euro7256 and additional QALYs of 0,43 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro17,027 per QALY; cost per LYG: euro22,318). The results were robust in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The provision of genetic testing to high-risk women with a BRCA1 and two mutation probability of >/= 10% based on the individual family cancer history appears to be a cost-effective option for the SHI.",2019-01-30315,30790097,Eur J Health Econ,Dirk Muller,2019,20 / 5,739-750,Yes,30790097,"Dirk Muller; Marion Danner; Rita Schmutzler; Christoph Engel; Kirsten Wassermann; Bjorn Stollenwerk; Stephanie Stock; Kerstin Rhiem; Economic modeling of risk-adapted screen-and-treat strategies in women at high risk for breast or ovarian cancer, Eur J Health Econ, 2019 Jul; 20(5):1618-7598; 739-750",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Screening, Surgical",provision of genetic testing vs. None,Not Stated,69 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,65 Years,3.00,3.00,17027,Euro,2017,20316.09
21243,First-line Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab vs Sunitinib for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"Importance: Recently, new drugs have been approved for the first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Nivolumab plus ipilimumab significantly increases overall survival for intermediate- and poor-risk patients with mRCC. However, considering the high cost of nivolumab plus ipilimumab, there is a need to assess its value by considering both efficacy and cost. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs sunitinib in the first-line setting for intermediate- and poor-risk patients with mRCC from the US payer perspective. Design, Setting, and Participants: A Markov model was developed to compare the lifetime cost and effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs sunitinib in the first-line treatment of mRCC using outcomes data from the CheckMate 214 phase 3 randomized clinical trial, which included 1096 patients with mRCC (median age, 62 years) and compared nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs sunitinib as first-line treatment of mRCC. In the analysis, patients were modeled to receive sunitinib or nivolumab plus ipilimumab for 4 doses followed by nivolumab monotherapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and lifetime costs were estimated, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000 to $150000 per QALY. Univariable, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the model uncertainty. Additional subgroup analyses were performed. Results: Nivolumab plus ipilimumab provided an additional 0.96 QALYs, at a cost of $108363 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses found the results to be most sensitive to overall survival hazard ratio (0.63; 95% CI, 0.44-0.89) and mean patient weight (70 kg, range, 40-200 kg). Other variables, such as the cost of nivolumab plus ipilimumab (mean, $32213.44; range, $25770.75-$38656.13), utility values for nivolumab plus ipilimumab (mean, 0.82; range, 0.65-0.98), and proportion receiving nivolumab in sunitinib arm (mean, 0.27; range, 0.22-0.32), had a moderate or minor influence on model results. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that nivolumab plus ipilimumab was most cost-effective for patients with programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 expression of at least 1% ($86390 per QALY). Conclusions and Relevance: In this model, nivolumab plus ipilimumab was estimated to be cost-effective compared with sunitinib for intermediate- and poor-risk patients with mRCC at a willingness-to-pay threshold from $100000 to $150000 per QALY.",2019-01-30316,30789633,Int Health,Xiaomin Wan,2019,/,,No,30789633,"Xiaomin Wan; YuCong Zhang; Chongqing Tan; Xiaohui Zeng; Liubao Peng; First-line Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab vs Sunitinib for Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis, Int Health, 2019 Mar 28; ():1876-3405",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- sunitinib,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,108363,United States,2018,111687.59

21248,Cost-effectiveness analysis of lenvatinib treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) compared with sorafenib in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib demonstrated a treatment effect on overall survival by the statistical confirmation of non-inferiority to sorafenib for the first-line treatment of uHCC. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib compared with sorafenib for patients with uHCC in Japan. METHODS: A partitioned-survival model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib versus sorafenib when treating uHCC patients over a lifetime horizon and considering total public healthcare expenditure. Efficacy and safety data were extracted from the REFLECT trial. Utility values were derived from the European Quality-of-Life 5-Dimension Questionnaire, conducted with patients enrolled in the REFLECT trial. Direct medical costs, such as primary drug therapy, outpatient visits, diagnostic tests, hospitalization, post-progression therapy, and adverse-event treatments, were included. Cost parameters unavailable in the clinical trial or publications were obtained based on the consolidated clinical standards from a Delphi panel of four Japanese medical experts. RESULTS: For lenvatinib versus sorafenib, the incremental cost was - 406,307 Japanese Yen (JPY), and the incremental life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 0.27 and 0.23, respectively. Thus, lenvatinib dominated sorafenib, due to the mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio falling in the fourth quadrant, conferring more benefit at lower costs compared with sorafenib. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that 81.3% of the simulations were favorable to lenvatinib compared with sorafenib, with a payer''s willingness-to-pay-per-QALY of 5 million JPY.

21249,Sarilumab monotherapy compared with adalimumab monotherapy for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis: an analysis of incremental cost per effectively treated patient,"Purpose: Treatment outcomes and direct medical costs were examined, from a US health payer perspective, of monotherapy with sarilumab 200 mg subcutaneous (SC) every 2 weeks (Q2W) vs adalimumab 40 mg SC Q2W/QW in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who are intolerant of, inadequate responders to, or considered inappropriate candidates for continued methotrexate treatment. Patients and methods: Short-term analysis was based on 24-week wholesale acquisition costs of drugs and treatment response observed in the MONARCH Phase III trial (NCT02332590) per American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50 criteria and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Moderate/Good Disease Activity Score 28-joint count erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Long-term analysis, which also considered drug administration and routine care costs, was conducted via a 6-month decision tree and a 1- to 10-year Markov model with microsimulation of patient profiles from the MOBILITY Phase III trial (NCT01061736). Utilities and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated by mapping 6-month ACR levels to a relative change in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index score and via published algorithms. Results: For sarilumab and adalimumab, respectively, 24-week drug costs were $18,954 and $29,232, and costs per responder were $26,435 vs $50,055 on ACR20; $41,475 vs $98,425 on ACR50; and $22,511 vs $41,230 on EULAR Moderate/Good.

21253,A screening strategy for latent tuberculosis in healthcare workers: Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of universal versus targeted screening,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical, cost-efficiency, and budgetary implications of universal versus targeted latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) screening strategies among healthcare workers (HCWs) in an intermediate tuberculosis (TB)-burden country. DESIGN: Pragmatic cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis using decision-analytic modeling. SETTING: A tertiary-care hospital in Singapore. METHODS: We compared 7 potentially implementable LTBI screening programs including universal and targeted strategies with different screening frequencies. Feasible targeting methods included stratification by country of origin (a proxy for risk of prior TB exposure) and by high-risk occupation. The clinical and financial consequences of each strategy were estimated relative to ""no screening"" (current practice) and compared to locally appropriate cost-effectiveness thresholds. All analyses were conducted from the hospital''s perspective over a 3-year time horizon, based on the typical hospital planning period. Parameter uncertainties were accounted for using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In our model, relative to current practice, screening new international hires and triennial screening of existing high-risk workers is most cost-effective (US$58 per quality adjusted life year [QALY]) and decreases active TB cases from 19 to 14. Screening all new hires combined with triennial universal screening, with or without annual high-risk screening or annual universal screening, reduced active TB to a range of 19 to 6 cases, but these strategies are less cost-effective and require substantially higher expenditures.

21259,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the MiniMed 670G Hybrid Closed-Loop System Versus Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion for Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Hybrid closed-loop (HCL) systems combine continuous glucose monitoring with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) to continuously self-adjust basal insulin delivery. Relative to CSII, HCL improves glycemic control and reduces the risk of hypoglycemia but has higher acquisition costs. The aim of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the MiniMed 670G HCL system versus CSII in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Sweden. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis, from a societal perspective, was performed over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Clinical data were sourced from a study comparing the MiniMed 670G system with CSII in people with T1D. Cost data, expressed in 2018 Swedish krona (SEK), were obtained from Swedish reference prices and published literature. RESULTS: The MiniMed 670G system was associated with a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain of 1.90 but higher overall costs versus CSII, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SEK 164,236 per QALY gained. Use of the HCL system resulted in a lower cumulative incidence of diabetes-related complications. Higher HCL system acquisition costs were partially offset by reduced complication costs and productivity losses. In people with T1D poorly controlled at baseline, the MiniMed 670G system was associated with 2.25 incremental QALYs versus CSII, yielding an ICER of SEK 15,830 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The MiniMed 670G system was associated with clinical benefits and quality-of-life improvements in people with T1D relative to CSII.

21260,Cost-Effectiveness of Osteoporosis Interventions to Improve Quality of Care After Upper Extremity Fracture: Results From a Randomized Trial (C-STOP Trial),"We assessed the cost-effectiveness of two models of osteoporosis care after upper extremity fragility fracture using a high-intensity Fracture Liaison Service (FLS) Case-Manager intervention versus a low-intensity FLS (ie, Active Control), and both relative to usual care. This analysis used data from a pragmatic patient-level parallel-arm comparative effectiveness trial of 361 community-dwelling participants 50 years or older with upper extremity fractures undertaken at a Canadian academic hospital. We used a decision-analytic Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the three treatment alternatives. The perspective was health service payer; the analytical horizon was lifetime; costs and health outcomes were discounted by 3%. Costs were expressed in 2016 Canadian dollars (CAD) and the health effect was measured by quality adjusted life years (QALYs). The average age of enrolled patients was 63 years and 89% were female. Per patient cost of the Case Manager and Active Control interventions were $66CAD and $18CAD, respectively. Compared to the Active Control, the Case Manager saved $333,000, gained seven QALYs, and averted nine additional fractures per 1000 patients. Compared to usual care, the Case Manager saved $564,000, gained 14 QALYs, and incurred 18 fewer fractures per 1000 patients, whereas the Active Control saved $231,000, gained seven QALYs, and incurred nine fewer fractures per 1000 patients. Although both interventions dominated usual care, the Case Manager intervention also dominated the Active Control. In 5000 probabilistic simulations, the probability that the Case Manager intervention was cost-effective was greater than 75% whereas the Active Control intervention was cost-effective in less than 20% of simulations. In summary, although the adoption of either of these approaches into clinical settings should lead to cost savings, reduced fractures, and increased quality-adjusted life for older adults following upper extremity fracture, the Case Manager intervention would be the most likely to be cost-effective.

21263,Cost-Effectiveness of Osteoporosis Screening Using Biomechanical Computed Tomography for Patients With a Previous Abdominal CT,"Osteoporosis screening rates by DXA are low (9.5% women, 1.7% men) in the US Medicare population aged 65 years and older. Addressing this care gap, we estimated the benefits of a validated osteoporosis diagnostic test suitable for patients age 65 years and older with an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan taken for any indication but without a recent DXA. Our analysis assessed a hypothetical cohort of 1000 such patients in a given year, and followed them for 5 years. Separately for each sex, we used Markov modeling to compare two mutually exclusive scenarios: (i) utilizing the CT scans, perform one-time ""biomechanical computed tomography"" (BCT) analysis to identify high-risk patients on the basis of both femoral strength and hip BMD T-scores; (ii) ignore the CT scan, and rely instead on usual care, consisting of future annual DXA screening at typical Medicare rates. For patients with findings indicative of osteoporosis, 50% underwent 2 years of treatment with alendronate. We found that BCT provided greater clinical benefit at lower cost for both sexes than usual care. In our base case, compared to usual care, BCT prevented hip fractures over a 5-year window (3.1 per 1000 women; 1.9 per 1000 men) and increased quality-adjusted life years (2.95 per 1000 women; 1.48 per 1000 men). Efficacy and savings increased further for higher-risk patient pools, greater treatment adherence, and longer treatment duration. When the sensitivity and specificity of BCT were set to those for DXA, the prevented hip fractures versus usual care remained high (2.7 per 1000 women; 1.5 per 1000 men), indicating the importance of high screening rates on clinical efficacy. Therefore, for patients with a previously taken abdominal CT and without a recent DXA, osteoporosis screening using biomechanical computed tomography may be a cost-effective alternative to current usual care.

21266,The Cost-Effectiveness of Interventions to Increase Utilization of Prone Positioning for Severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome,"OBJECTIVES: Despite strong evidence supporting proning in acute respiratory distress syndrome, few eligible patients receive it. This study determines the cost-effectiveness of interventions to increase utilization of proning for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. DESIGN: We created decision trees to model severe acute respiratory distress syndrome from ICU admission through death (societal perspective) and hospital discharge (hospital perspective). We assumed patients received low tidal volume ventilation. We used short-term outcome estimates from the PROSEVA trial and longitudinal cost and benefit data from cohort studies. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, we used distributions for each input that included the fifth to 95th percentile of its CI. SETTING: ICUs that care for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. SUBJECTS: Patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: The implementation of a hypothetical intervention to increase the appropriate utilization of prone positioning. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the societal perspective model, an intervention that increased proning utilization from 16% to 65% yielded an additional 0.779 (95% CI, 0.088-1.714) quality-adjusted life years at an additional long-term cost of $31,156 (95% CI, -$158 to $92,179) (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $38,648 per quality-adjusted life year [95% CI, $1,695-$98,522]). If society was willing to pay $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year, any intervention costing less than $51,328 per patient with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome would represent good value. From a hospital perspective, the intervention yielded 0.072 (95% CI, 0.008-0.147) more survivals-to-discharge at a cost of $5,242 (95% CI, -$19,035 to $41,019) (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $44,615 per extra survival [95% CI, -$250,912 to $558,222]). If hospitals were willing to pay $100,000 per survival-to-discharge, any intervention costing less than $5,140 per patient would represent good value.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov models were developed to estimate life expectancy and lifetime costs for 60-year-old patients with a Bosniak IIF or III renal cyst (the reference cases) managed by AS versus NSS. The models incorporated the malignancy rates, reclassification rates during follow-up, treatment effectiveness, complications and costs, and short- and long-term outcomes. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to identify management preference under an assumed $75,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) societal willingness-to-pay threshold, using data from studies in the literature and the 2015 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule. The effects of key parameters were addressed in a multiway sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of malignancy for Bosniak IIF and III renal cysts was 26% (25/96) and 52% (542/1046). Under base case assumptions for Bosniak IIF cysts, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of NSS relative to AS was $731,309 per QALY for women, exceeding the assumed societal willingness-to-pay threshold, and AS outperformed NSS for both life expectancy and cost for men. For Bosniak III cysts, AS yielded greater life expectancy (24.8 and 19.4 more days) and lower lifetime costs (cost difference of $12,128 and $11,901) than NSS for men and women, indicating dominance of AS over NSS.

21271,MR Angiography Screening and Surveillance for Intracranial Aneurysms in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"Background Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) affects one in 400 to one in 1000 individuals; 10%-11% of these individuals have intracranial aneurysms. The frequency and patterns of screening for intracranial aneurysms have not been defined. Purpose To evaluate different MR angiography screening and surveillance strategies for unruptured intracranial aneurysms in patients with ADPKD. Materials and Methods A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed accounting for both costs and outcomes from a societal perspective. Five different management strategies were evaluated: (a) no screening for intracranial aneurysm, (b) one-time screening with annual MR angiography follow-up in patients with intracranial aneurysm, (c) MR angiographic screening every 5 years with endovascular treatment in detected intracranial aneurysm, (d) MR angiography screening every 5 years with annual MR angiography follow-up in patients with intracranial aneurysm, and (e) MR angiography screening every 5 years with biennial follow-up in patients with intracranial aneurysm. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results Base case calculation shows that MR angiography screening of patients with ADPKD every 5 years and annual follow-up in patients with detected intracranial aneurysm is the optimal strategy (cost, $19 839; utility, 25.86 quality-adjusted life years), which becomes more favorable as the life expectancy increases beyond 6 years. The conclusion remains robust in probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses. When the prevalence of intracranial aneurysms is greater than 10%, annual rupture risk is 0.35%-2.5%, and the rate of de novo aneurysm detection is lower than 1.8%, MR angiography screening every 5 years with annual MR angiography follow-up is the favorable strategy. Conclusion Screening for intracranial aneurysms with MR angiography in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is cost-effective. Repeat screening every 5 years should be performed after a negative initial study. Annual surveillance MR angiography is optimal in patients with detected, incidental intracranial aneurysm, and treatment may be considered in patients with growing, high-risk aneurysms.

21275,Cost-effectiveness analysis of endovascular versus open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm in a high-volume center,"OBJECTIVE: Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is the standard treatment for anatomically suitable patients. EVAR has been associated with a lower perioperative morbidity and mortality compared with open surgical repair (OSR) at the expense of increased reinterventions and costs. We aimed to compare the outcomes of EVAR and OSR for elective AAA repair. The primary end point was cost per QALY at 3 years. Secondary end points were perioperative morbidity and mortality; freedom from reintervention; length of hospital, high-dependency unit, and intensive care unit stay; and freedom from all-cause mortality. METHODS: The project was approved by the Galway Clinical Research Ethics Committee. This project followed the Declaration of Helsinki. This was an audit of interventions that had already taken place. No active clinical intervention was undertaken, and patients'' anonymity was preserved; thus, individual patient consent was not obtained. Data on all elective AAA repairs at a tertiary referral vascular center were collected from 2002 to 2015. Demographics and outcomes were reported according to the Society for Vascular Surgery guidelines. QALY was measured on the basis of a quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity assessment. Data were analyzed using parametric and nonparametric tests. RESULTS: Between 2002 and 2015, a total of 494 patients required elective AAA surgery; 401 underwent EVAR and 93 underwent OSR. Demographics and vascular-related risk factors were similar in both groups. Median (interquartile range) cost per QALY at 3 years was euro5776 (euro5541-euro6481) for EVAR vs euro7101 (euro5812-euro8952) for OSR (P < .001). EVAR was associated with reduced perioperative morbidity (12.2% vs 50%; P < .001). There was no significant association between procedure and perioperative mortality (EVAR, 1.7%; OSR, 4.3%; P = .130). There was no significant association found between the procedure and reintervention (P = .502).

21277,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Vaccination for Prevention of Herpes Zoster and Related Complications: Input for National Recommendations,"Background: The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recently developed recommendations for use of a new recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV). Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with RZV compared with zoster vaccine live (ZVL) and no vaccination, the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with RZV for persons who have previously received ZVL, and the cost-effectiveness of preferential vaccination with RZV over ZVL. Design: Simulation (state-transition) model using U.S. epidemiologic, clinical, and cost data. Data Sources: Published data. Target Population: Hypothetical cohort of immunocompetent U.S. adults aged 50 years or older. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal and health care sector. Intervention: Vaccination with RZV (recommended 2-dose regimen), vaccination with ZVL, and no vaccination. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results of Base-Case Analysis: For vaccination with RZV compared with no vaccination, ICERs ranged by age from $10 000 to $47 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), using a societal perspective and assuming 100% completion of the 2-dose RZV regimen. For persons aged 60 years or older, ICERs were less than $60 000 per QALY. Vaccination with ZVL was dominated by vaccination with RZV for all age groups 60 years or older. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results were most sensitive to changes in vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, herpes zoster incidence, and probability of postherpetic neuralgia. Vaccination with RZV after previous administration of ZVL yielded an ICER of less than $60 000 per QALY for persons aged 60 years or older. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, RZV remained the preferred strategy in at least 95% of simulations, including those with 50% completion of the second dose. Limitation: Few data were available on risk for serious adverse events, adherence to the recommended 2-dose regimen, and probability of recurrent zoster.

21281,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Vaccination for Prevention of Herpes Zoster and Related Complications: Input for National Recommendations,"Background: The U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recently developed recommendations for use of a new recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV). Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with RZV compared with zoster vaccine live (ZVL) and no vaccination, the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with RZV for persons who have previously received ZVL, and the cost-effectiveness of preferential vaccination with RZV over ZVL. Design: Simulation (state-transition) model using U.S. epidemiologic, clinical, and cost data. Data Sources: Published data. Target Population: Hypothetical cohort of immunocompetent U.S. adults aged 50 years or older. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal and health care sector. Intervention: Vaccination with RZV (recommended 2-dose regimen), vaccination with ZVL, and no vaccination. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results of Base-Case Analysis: For vaccination with RZV compared with no vaccination, ICERs ranged by age from $10 000 to $47 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), using a societal perspective and assuming 100% completion of the 2-dose RZV regimen. For persons aged 60 years or older, ICERs were less than $60 000 per QALY. Vaccination with ZVL was dominated by vaccination with RZV for all age groups 60 years or older. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results were most sensitive to changes in vaccine effectiveness, duration of protection, herpes zoster incidence, and probability of postherpetic neuralgia. Vaccination with RZV after previous administration of ZVL yielded an ICER of less than $60 000 per QALY for persons aged 60 years or older. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, RZV remained the preferred strategy in at least 95% of simulations, including those with 50% completion of the second dose.

21287,Cost-Effectiveness Comparison of Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines in Turkish Children,"BACKGROUND: The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) is used for universal infant vaccination in Turkey. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness of replacing PCV13 with pneumococcal nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV). METHODS: A Markov cohort model with monthly cycles following 1 cohort of infants over a 10-year time horizon was used. Local input parameters were obtained from published sources and expert consultation whenever possible. The model was adapted to estimate the health benefits and economic impact of each vaccine on invasive pneumococcal disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM). An annual discount rate of 3% was used for benefits and costs (2016 euros). RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, vaccinating 1 birth cohort of 1 325 783 infants with PHiD-CV instead of PCV13 was predicted to have the same impact on meningitis and pneumonia, a similar impact on bacteremia (+30 cases), but greater reductions in AOM-related general practitioner visits (-34 955) and hospitalizations (-624). Assuming equal vaccine prices, PHiD-CV was predicted to be dominant over PCV13 (176 additional quality-adjusted life-years while saving euro635 330 [discounted]). One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that varying the vaccine price differential had the largest effect on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and then AOM parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted PHiD-CV to be dominant over PCV13 in 92.4% of simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Any difference in price between PHiD-CV and PCV13 is expected to be the key driver of vaccine choice for preventing childhood pneumococcal disease in Turkey.

21288,Cost-Effectiveness of Web-Based Patient-Reported Outcome Surveillance in Patients With Lung Cancer,"INTRODUCTION: A multicenter randomized clinical trial in France found an overall survival benefit of web-based patient-reported outcome (PRO)-based surveillance after initial treatment for lung cancer compared with conventional surveillance. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this PRO-based surveillance in lung cancer patients. METHODS: This medico-economic analysis used data from the clinical trial, augmented by abstracted chart data and costs of consultations, imaging, transportations, information technology, and treatments. Costs were calculated based on actual reimbursement rates in France, and health utilities were estimated based on scientific literature review. Willingness-to-pay thresholds of euro30,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and euro90,000 per QALY were used to define a very cost-effective and cost-effective strategy, respectively. Average annual costs of experimental and control surveillance approaches were calculated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed as cost per life-year gained and QALY gained, from the health insurance payer perspective. One-way and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Average annual cost of surveillance follow-up was euro362 lower per patient in the PRO arm (euro941/year/patient) compared to control (euro1,304/year/patient). The PRO approach presented an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro12,127 per life-year gained and euro20,912 per QALY gained.

21290,"Ten-year follow-up of a randomised trial of drainage, irrigation and fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT) in infants with post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation","BACKGROUND: The drainage, irrigation and fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT) trial, conducted in 2003-6, showed a reduced rate of death or severe disability at 2 years in the DRIFT compared with the standard treatment group, among preterm infants with intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation. OBJECTIVES: To compare cognitive function, visual and sensorimotor ability, emotional well-being, use of specialist health/rehabilitative and educational services, neuroimaging, and economic costs and benefits at school age. DESIGN: Ten-year follow-up of a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Neonatal intensive care units (Bristol, Katowice, Glasgow and Bergen). PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-two of the original 77 infants randomised. INTERVENTIONS: DRIFT or standard therapy (cerebrospinal fluid tapping). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary - cognitive disability. Secondary - vision; sensorimotor disability; emotional/behavioural function; education; neurosurgical sequelae on magnetic resonance imaging; preference-based measures of health-related quality of life; costs of neonatal treatment and of subsequent health care in childhood; health and social care costs and impact on family at age 10 years; and a decision analysis model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of DRIFT compared with standard treatment up to the age of 18 years. RESULTS: By 10 years of age, 12 children had died and 13 were either lost to follow-up or had declined to participate. A total of 52 children were assessed at 10 years of age (DRIFT, n = 28; standard treatment, n = 24). Imbalances in gender and birthweight favoured the standard treatment group. The unadjusted mean cognitive quotient (CQ) score was 69.3 points [standard deviation (SD) 30.1 points] in the DRIFT group compared with 53.7 points (SD 35.7 points) in the standard treatment group, a difference of 15.7 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.9 to 34.2 points; p = 0.096. After adjusting for the prespecified covariates (gender, birthweight and grade of IVH), this evidence strengthened: children who received DRIFT had a CQ advantage of 23.5 points (p = 0.009). The binary outcome, alive without severe cognitive disability, gave strong evidence that DRIFT improved cognition [unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 3.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 11.0; p = 0.026) and adjusted OR 10.0 (95% CI 2.1 to 46.7; p = 0.004)]; the number needed to treat was three. No significant differences were found in any secondary outcomes. There was weak evidence that DRIFT reduced special school attendance (adjusted OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.05; p = 0.059). The neonatal stay (unadjusted mean difference pound6556, 95% CI - pound11,161 to pound24,273) and subsequent hospital care ( pound3413, 95% CI - pound12,408 to pound19,234) costs were higher in the DRIFT arm, but the wide CIs included zero. The decision analysis model indicated that DRIFT has the potential to be cost-effective at 18 years of age. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( pound15,621 per quality-adjusted life-year) was below the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold. The cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to adjustment for birthweight and gender. LIMITATIONS: The main limitations are the sample size of the trial and that important characteristics were unbalanced at baseline and at the 10-year follow-up. Although the analyses conducted here were prespecified in the analysis plan, they had not been prespecified in the original trial registration. CONCLUSIONS: DRIFT improves cognitive function when taking into account birthweight, grade of IVH and gender. DRIFT is probably effective and, given the reduction in the need for special education, has the potential to be cost-effective as well. A future UK multicentre trial is required to assess efficacy and safety of DRIFT when delivered across multiple sites. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN80286058.

21291,Risk assessment scales to predict risk of hospital treated repeat self-harm: A cost-effectiveness modelling analysis,"BACKGROUND: Risk scales are used widely for assessing individuals presenting to Emergency Departments (EDs) following self-harm. There is growing evidence that risk scales have limited clinical utility in identifying episodes at highest risk of repeat self-harm. However, their cost-effectiveness in terms of treatment allocation and subsequent repeat self-harm is unknown. We aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of five risk scales (SAD PERSONS Scale, Modified SAD PERSONS Scale, ReACT Self-Harm Rule, Manchester Self-Harm Rule, Barratt Impulsivity Scale) and single item clinician and patient ratings of risk. METHOD: Quality-Adjusted Life Years were estimated for each episode. The five risk scales and the patient rating were compared to the clinician rating. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated for each scale, using a range of ICER thresholds. Sensitivity analysis explored different model assumptions. RESULTS: The formal scales were less cost-effective than the clinician and patient ratings across a range of ICER thresholds ( pound0- pound30,000). The five scales were also less cost-effective than the clinician rating in most alternative scenario analyses. However, the clinician rating would be likely to result in unnecessary treatment costs for over half of patients identified as high risk.

21297,"Economic evaluation of a publicly funded hepatitis A travel vaccination program in Ontario, Canada","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis A virus (HAV) causes acute liver infection and is spread through the fecal-oral route. Travel to countries in HAV-endemic regions (e.g., Asia and Latin America) is a well-described risk factor for infection. Currently, Ontario publicly funds hepatitis A vaccination for some populations at high risk of HAV infection but not for all travellers to endemic countries. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of expanding publicly funded HAV vaccination to people planning travel to HAV-endemic regions, from the Ontario healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis comparing an expanded high-risk publicly-funded hepatitis A vaccination program including funded vaccine for travellers to endemic regions to the current high risk program in Ontario. A Markov state transition model was developed, including six possible health states. Model parameters were informed through targeted literature searches and included hepatitis A disease probabilities, utilities associated with health states, health system expenditures, and vaccine costs. Future costs and health outcomes were discounted at 1.5%. Primary outcomes included cost, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over a lifetime time horizon. We conducted one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The expanded high risk HAV vaccine program provided few incremental health gains in the travel population (mean 0.000037 QALYs/person), at an incremental cost of $124.31. The ICER of the expanded program compared to status quo is $3,391,504/QALY gained. The conclusion of the model was robust to changes in key parameters across reasonable ranges. CONCLUSIONS: The expanded vaccination program substantially exceeds commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds. Further research concerning possible cost-effective implementation of high-risk travel hepatitis A vaccination should focus on a more integrated understanding of the risk of acquiring hepatitis A during travel to endemic regions (e.g., purpose, length of stay).",2019-01-30372,30770225,Vaccine,L C Ramsay,2019,37 / 11,1467-1475,Yes,30770225,"L C Ramsay; K Anyiwe; M Li; L Macdonald; P C Coyte; B Sander; Economic evaluation of a publicly funded hepatitis A travel vaccination program in Ontario, Canada, Vaccine, 2019 Mar 7; 37(11):1873-2518; 1467-1475",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Immunization,publically funded hepatitis a vaccination program including all travelers to endemic countries vs. Standard/Usual Care- Hepatitis A vaccination privately purchased by travelers that do not meet one of the current Ontario high risk eligibility criteria,2016 Ontario travel population cohort,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,3391504,Canada,2017,2758013.88
21298,Induction of labor at 39 weeks of gestation versus expectant management for low-risk nulliparous women: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: A large, recent multicenter trial found that induction of labor at 39 weeks for low-risk nulliparous women was not associated with an increased risk of cesarean delivery or adverse neonatal outcomes. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine the cost-effectiveness and outcomes associated with induction of labor at 39 weeks vs expectant management for low-risk nulliparous women in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness model using TreeAge software was designed to compare outcomes in women who were induced at 39 weeks vs expectantly managed. We used a theoretical cohort of 1.6 million women, the approximate number of nulliparous term births in the United States annually that are considered low risk. Outcomes included mode of delivery, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, macrosomia, stillbirth, permanent brachial plexus injury, and neonatal death, in addition to cost and quality-adjusted life years for both the woman and neonate. Model inputs were derived from the literature, and a cost-effectiveness threshold was set at $100,000/quality-adjusted life years. RESULTS: In our theoretical cohort of 1.6 million women, induction of labor resulted in 54,498 fewer cesarean deliveries and 79,152 fewer cases of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. We also found that induction of labor resulted in 795 fewer cases of stillbirth and 11 fewer neonatal deaths, despite 86 additional cases of brachial plexus injury. Induction of labor resulted in increased costs but increased quality-adjusted life years with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $87,691.91 per quality-adjusted life year. In sensitivity analysis, if the cost of induction of labor was increased by $180, elective induction would no longer be cost effective. Similarly, we found that if the rate of cesarean delivery was the same in both strategies, elective induction of labor at 39 weeks would not be a cost-effective strategy. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis via Monte Carlo simulation, we found that induction of labor was cost effective only 65% of the time. CONCLUSION: In our theoretical cohort, induction of labor in nulliparous term women at 39 weeks of gestation resulted in improved outcomes but increased costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was marginally cost effective but would lead to an additional 2 billion dollars of healthcare costs. Whether individual clinicians and healthcare systems offer routine induction of labor at 39 weeks will need to depend on local capacity, careful evaluation and allocation of healthcare resources, and patient preferences.

21299,"Cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and the budget impact of antidepressants versus preventive cognitive therapy with or without tapering of antidepressants","BACKGROUND: As depression has a recurrent course, relapse and recurrence prevention is essential.AimsIn our randomised controlled trial (registered with the Nederlands trial register, identifier: NTR1907), we found that adding preventive cognitive therapy (PCT) to maintenance antidepressants (PCT+AD) yielded substantial protective effects versus antidepressants only in individuals with recurrent depression. Antidepressants were not superior to PCT while tapering antidepressants (PCT/-AD). To inform decision-makers on treatment allocation, we present the corresponding cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and budget impact. METHOD: Data were analysed (n = 289) using a societal perspective with 24-months of follow-up, with depression-free days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as health outcomes. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated and cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were derived to provide information about cost-effectiveness. The budget impact was examined with a health economic simulation model. RESULTS: Mean total costs over 24 months were euro6814, euro10 264 and euro13 282 for AD+PCT, antidepressants only and PCT/-AD, respectively. Compared with antidepressants only, PCT+AD resulted in significant improvements in depression-free days but not QALYs. Health gains did not significantly favour antidepressants only versus PCT/-AD. High probabilities were found that PCT+AD versus antidepressants only and antidepressants only versus PCT/-AD were dominant with low willingness-to-pay thresholds. The budget impact analysis showed decreased societal costs for PCT+AD versus antidepressants only and for antidepressants only versus PCT/-AD. CONCLUSIONS: Adding PCT to antidepressants is cost-effective over 24 months and PCT with guided tapering of antidepressants in long-term users might result in extra costs. Future studies examining costs and effects of antidepressants versus psychological interventions over a longer period may identify a break-even point where PCT/-AD will become cost-effective.Declaration of interestC.L.H.B. is co-editor of PLOS One and receives no honorarium for this role.
