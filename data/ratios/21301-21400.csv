21301,Cost-effectiveness analysis of telephone cognitive-behaviour therapy for adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder,"BACKGROUND: Telephone cognitive-behaviour therapy (TCBT) may be a cost-effective method for improving access to evidence-based treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in young people.AimsEconomic evaluation of TCBT compared with face-to-face CBT for OCD in young people. METHOD: Randomised non-inferiority trial comparing TCBT with face-to-face CBT for 72 young people (aged 11 to 18) with a diagnosis of OCD. Cost-effectiveness at 12-month follow-up was explored in terms of the primary clinical outcome (Children''s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale, CY-BOCS) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (trial registration: ISRCTN27070832). RESULTS: Total health and social care costs were higher for face-to-face CBT (mean total cost pound2965, s.d. = pound1548) than TCBT (mean total cost pound2475, s.d. = pound1024) but this difference was non-significant (P = 0.118). There were no significant between-group differences in QALYs or the CY-BOCS and there was strong evidence to support the clinical non-inferiority of TCBT. Cost-effectiveness analysis suggests a 74% probability that face-to-face CBT is cost-effective compared with TCBT in terms of QALYs, but the result was less clear in terms of CY-BOCS, with TCBT being the preferred option at low levels of willingness to pay and the probability of either intervention being cost-effective at higher levels of willingness to pay being around 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Although cost-effectiveness of TCBT was sensitive to the outcome measure used, TCBT should be considered a clinically non-inferior alternative when access to standard clinic-based CBT is limited, or when patient preference is expressed.Declaration of interestD.M.-C. reports research grants from the Swedish Research Council (Vetenskapsradet), the Swedish Research Council for Health, working life and welfare (Forte), the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the UK National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), as well as royalties from Wolters Kluwer Health and Elsevier, all unrelated to the submitted work.",2019-01-30389,30762502,BJPsych Open,Hiong Tie,2019,5 / 1,e7,No,30762502,"Hiong Tie; Georgina Krebs; Katie Lang; James Shearer; Cynthia Turner; David Mataix-Cols; Karina Lovell; Isobel Heyman; Sarah Byford; Cost-effectiveness analysis of telephone cognitive-behaviour therapy for adolescents with obsessive-compulsive disorder, BJPsych Open, 2019 Jan; 5(1):2056-4724; e7",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Health Education or Behavior,cognitive behavioral therapy vs. Telephone CBT,"Inclusion criteria were: (a) primary OCD according to DSM-IV criteria,18 (b) a Childrenâ€™s Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS)19 score of 16 or greater, indicating moderate to severe impairment, (c) aged 11 to 18 years; (d) medication free or on a stable dose of medication for a period of 12 weeks or longer, (e) no suicidal intent, drug or alcohol misuse, or psychotic symptoms, (f) no intellectual disability (also known in UK health services as learning disability) or pervasive developmental disability, (g) need and want CBT, and agreeable to randomisation, and (h) agreeable to parental involvement in treatment.",18 Years,11 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,9461,United Kingdom,2011,17463.9
21302,Universal cervical length screening with a cervicometer to prevent preterm birth <34 weeks: a decision and economic analysis,"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide; evidence-based strategies to decrease preterm birth are desperately needed. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate which of three strategies for screening for shortened cervix in asymptomatic low-risk women is the most cost-effective in terms of prevention of preterm birth and associated morbidity. STUDY DESIGN: A decision analysis model was developed from available published evidence comparing three strategies in screening asymptomatic low-risk women for shortened cervix: (1) cervicometer with subsequent referral for transvaginal ultrasound, (2) transvaginal ultrasound screening, and (3) no screening. The cost and effectiveness of each strategy was assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost in US dollars. RESULTS: Screening with a cervicometer with referral was the most cost-effective strategy and represented a savings of $999.65 ($11,617.28 versus $12,616.93) over screening with ultrasound, and a savings of $15,601.62 ($11,617.28 versus $27,218.90) over no screening. Costs for outcomes ranged from $3528 for a healthy neonate >/=34 weeks to $717,467.5 for a neonate <34 weeks with severe morbidity. The cervicometer strategy avoided 11.68 neonatal deaths per 1000 deliveries (3.59 deaths versus 15.27 deaths) compared with no screening, and avoided 0.73 neonatal deaths per 1000 deliveries (3.59 deaths versus 4.32 deaths) compared with ultrasound strategy. The cervicometer strategy prevented 82.44 preterm births per 1000 deliveries (22.56 versus 105.00) compared with no screening, and 5.10 preterm births per 1000 deliveries (22.56 versus 27.66) compared with ultrasound strategy. Per QALY, cervicometer screening cost $386.57, transvaginal ultrasound cost $420.31, and no screening cost $922.73. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings, including evaluation across the range of quoted transvaginal ultrasound costs ($43-$300). CONCLUSION: A simulation of universal screening of asymptomatic low-risk women with a cervicometer with subsequent referral for ultrasound for those with a cervix <25 mm is cost-effective and yields the greatest reduction in preterm births at <34 weeks.

21304,Cost-utility analysis of mechanical thrombectomy between 6 and 24 hours in acute ischemic stroke,"BACKGROUND: Recently, two randomized controlled trials demonstrated the benefit of mechanical thrombectomy performed between 6 and 24 h in acute ischemic stroke. The current economic evidence is supporting the intervention only within 6 h, but extended thrombectomy treatment times may result in better long-term outcomes for a larger cohort of patients. AIMS: We compared the cost-utility of mechanical thrombectomy in addition to medical treatment versus medical treatment alone performed beyond 6 h from stroke onset in the UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of mechanical thrombectomy compared to medical treatment was performed using a Markov model that estimates expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 20-year time horizon. We present the results of three models using the data from the DEFUSE 3 and DAWN trials and evidence from published sources. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, the incremental cost per QALY of mechanical thrombectomy was $1564 ( pound1219) when performed after 12 h from onset, $5253 ( pound4096) after 16 h and $3712 ( pound2894) after 24 h. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that thrombectomy had a 99.9% probability of being cost-effective at the minimum willingness to pay for a QALY commonly used in the UK.

21307,Rehabilitation after resurfacing hip arthroplasty: cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs, effects, and cost-utility of an accelerated physiotherapy programme versus a standard physiotherapy programme following resurfacing hip arthroplasty. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A UK National Health Service hospital and patients'' homes. SUBJECTS: A total of 80 male resurfacing hip arthroplasty patients randomized post procedure to one of the two programmes. INTERVENTIONS: The accelerated physiotherapy programme commenced in hospital with patients being fully weight bearing, without hip precautions, and following a range of exercises facilitating gait re-education, balance, and lower limb strength. Standard physiotherapy commenced in hospital, but hip precautions were used and exercises were only partially weight bearing. In both groups, patients continued with their exercises at home for an eight-week period. MAIN MEASURES: Data on healthcare contacts were collected from patients to 12 months and costed using unit costs from national sources. Information was also collected on patients'' costs. Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire and used to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to 12 months. Mean costs and QALYs for each trial arm were compared. RESULTS: On average, the accelerated physiotherapy programme was less expensive (mean cost difference - pound200; 95% confidence interval: - pound656 to pound255) and more effective (mean QALY difference 0.13; 95% confidence interval: 0.05 to 0.21) than standard physiotherapy and had a high probability of being cost-effective.

21308,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of glucosamine for osteoarthritis based on simulation of individual patient data obtained from aggregated data in published studies,"BACKGROUND: The economic evaluation of treatments usually requires access to individual patient data, which is difficult to obtain. Moreover, in osteoarthritis, health utility scores are unavailable and can be assessed only using a validated equation model based on various clinical data. We aimed to develop and validate a methodology to simulate individual health utility scores from aggregated clinical data available in published studies to calculate the cost-effectiveness of different glucosamine preparations (i.e., crystalline glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine sulfate, and glucosamine hydrochloride) used for osteoarthritis. METHODS: We developed a method to simulate individual utility values and validated the model by comparing the results obtained with the simulation and the results of one trial where the utility scores are available. Then, we simulated the utility scores of 10 published trials that used different glucosamine preparations. The utility estimates were used to calculate the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) using the area-under-the-curve method. Costs were for the glucosamine product only. The incremental cost/effectiveness ratio (ICER) was then calculated. RESULTS: The values of utility scores calculated from data sources and those simulated with the model were similar. From 10 studies where utility was simulated, four used crystalline glucosamine sulfate, and six used other formulations. The ICER revealed that compared to placebo, crystalline glucosamine sulfate only was cost-effective at all time points and up to 3 years with a median ICER of 5347.2 euro/QALY at month 3, 4807.2 euro/QALY at month 6 and 11535.5 euro/QALY at year 3. The use of other formulations was not cost-effective.

21311,The Cost-Effectiveness of Multigene Panel Testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Norway,"Background. Expansion of routine genetic testing for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer from conventional BRCA testing to a multigene test could improve diagnostic yield and increase the opportunity for cancer prevention in both identified carriers and their relatives. We use an economic decision model to assess whether the current knowledge on non-BRCA mutation prevalence, cancer risk, and patient preferences justifies switching to a multigene panel for testing of early-onset breast cancer patients. Methods. We evaluated routine testing by BRCA testing, a 7-gene panel, and a 14-gene panel using individual-level simulations of annual health state transitions over a lifetime perspective. Breast and ovarian cancer incidence is reduced and posttreatment survival is improved when high-risk mutations are detected and risk-reducing treatment offered. Most model inputs were synthesized from published literature. Intermediate health outcomes included breast and ovarian cancer incidence rates, along with organ-specific cancer mortality. Cost-effectiveness outcomes were health sector costs and quality-adjusted life years. Results. Intermediate health outcomes improved by testing with multigene panels. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of $77,000, a 7-gene panel test with five non-BRCA genes was the optimal strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $53,310 per quality-adjusted life year compared to BRCA-only testing. Limitations. Unable to stratify carriers to specific mutations within genes, we can only make predictions on the gene level, with combined risk estimates for known variants. As mutation prevalence is the absolute upper bound of returns to more expansive testing, the rarity of modelled mutations makes analysis outcomes sensitive to model implementation. Conclusions. A 7-gene panel to diagnose hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in early-onset breast cancer patients can be a cost-effective alternative to current BRCA-only testing in Norway.",2019-01-30410,30746499,MDM Policy Pract,Lars Asphaug,2019,4 / 1,2381468318821103,No,30746499,"Lars Asphaug; Hans Olav Melberg; The Cost-Effectiveness of Multigene Panel Testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Norway, MDM Policy Pract, 2019 Jan-Jun; 4(1):2381-4683; 2381468318821103",QALY,Norway,Not Stated,Screening,7-gene panel vs. BRCA only,relatives of identified BRCA carriers,64 Years,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,53310,United States,2016,57486.72

Most model inputs were synthesized from published literature. Intermediate health outcomes included breast and ovarian cancer incidence rates, along with organ-specific cancer mortality. Cost-effectiveness outcomes were health sector costs and quality-adjusted life years. Results. Intermediate health outcomes improved by testing with multigene panels. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of $77,000, a 7-gene panel test with five non-BRCA genes was the optimal strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $53,310 per quality-adjusted life year compared to BRCA-only testing. Limitations. Unable to stratify carriers to specific mutations within genes, we can only make predictions on the gene level, with combined risk estimates for known variants. As mutation prevalence is the absolute upper bound of returns to more expansive testing, the rarity of modelled mutations makes analysis outcomes sensitive to model implementation. Conclusions. A 7-gene panel to diagnose hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in early-onset breast cancer patients can be a cost-effective alternative to current BRCA-only testing in Norway.",2019-01-30410,30746499,MDM Policy Pract,Lars Asphaug,2019,4 / 1,2381468318821103,No,30746499,"Lars Asphaug; Hans Olav Melberg; The Cost-Effectiveness of Multigene Panel Testing for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer in Norway, MDM Policy Pract, 2019 Jan-Jun; 4(1):2381-4683; 2381468318821103",QALY,Norway,Not Stated,Screening,14-gene panel vs. 7-gene panel to diagnose hereditary breast and ovarian cancer in early-onset breast cancer patients,relatives of identified BRCA carriers,64 Years,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,127071,United States,2016,137026.72
21313,Dexamethasone implant for non-infectious uveitis: is it cost-effective?,"BACKGROUND: Uveitis is inflammation inside the eye. The objective of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of a dexamethasone implant plus current practice (immunosuppressants and systemic corticosteroids) compared with current practice alone, in patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior or pan-uveitis and to identify areas for future research. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate the costs and benefits of dexamethasone. Systematic reviews were performed to identify available relevant evidence. Quality of life data from the key randomised-controlled trial (HURON) was used to estimate the interventions'' effectiveness compared with the trial''s comparator arm (placebo plus limited current practice (LCP)). The analysis took a National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Costs were calculated based on standard UK sources. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of one dexamethasone implant compared with LCP is estimated as pound19 509 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The factors with the largest impact on the results were rate of blindness and relative proportion of blindness cases avoided by dexamethasone. Using plausible alternative assumptions, dexamethasone could be cost saving or it may be associated with an ICER of pound56 329 per QALY gained compared with LCP. CONCLUSIONS: Dexamethasone is estimated to be cost-effective using generally accepted UK thresholds. However, there is substantial uncertainty around these results due to scarcity of evidence. Future research on the following would help provide more reliable estimates: effectiveness of dexamethasone versus current practice (instead of LCP), with subgroup analyses for unilateral and bilateral uveitis, incidence of long-term blindness and effectiveness of dexamethasone in avoiding blindness.",2019-01-30414,30745307,Br J Ophthalmol,Hazel Squires,2019,/,,No,30745307,"Hazel Squires; Inigo Bermejo; Edith N Poku; Katy Cooper; John Stevens; Jean Hamilton; Ruth Wong; Alastair K Denniston; Ian Pearce; Fahd Mohammed Quhill; Dexamethasone implant for non-infectious uveitis: is it cost-effective?, Br J Ophthalmol, 2019 Feb 11; ():0007-1161",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,one dexamethasone implant vs. placebo plus limited current practice,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,19509,United States,2015,21302.88

However, a retrospective analysis of real-world data from the French Comprehensive Cancer Centers (FCCC) through the Epidemiological Strategy and Medical Economics (ESME) Research Program, suggested that in this setting, the addition of bevacizumab may confer a significant benefit in terms of both PFS and OS. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone in the first-line treatment of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer at specialist oncology centers in France. METHODS: The analysis was performed using a three-state Markov model and clinical input data from N = 3426 HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients treated with bevacizumab plus paclitaxel or paclitaxel alone. The analysis was performed from a third party payer perspective over a 10-year time horizon; future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 4% per annum. RESULTS: In the overall population, the addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel led to incremental gain of 0.72 life years and 0.48 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to paclitaxel alone. The incremental lifetime cost of the addition of bevacizumab was EUR 27,390, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EUR 56,721 per QALY gained for bevacizumab plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone.

21317,Cost-effectiveness analysis of isavuconazole versus voriconazole for the treatment of patients with possible invasive aspergillosis in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Voriconazole is well established as standard treatment for invasive aspergillosis (IA). In 2017, isavuconazole, a new antifungal from the azole class, with a broader pathogen spectrum, was introduced in Sweden. A model has therefore been developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole and voriconazole in the treatment of possible IA in adults in Sweden. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole versus voriconazole was evaluated using a decision-tree model. Patients with possible IA entered the model, with 6% assumed to actually have mucormycosis. It was also assumed that pathogen information would become available during the course of treatment for only 50% of patients, with differential diagnosis unavailable for the remainder. Patients who were considered unresponsive to first-line treatment were switched to second-line treatment with liposomal amphotericin-B. Data and clinical definitions included in the model were taken from the published randomised clinical trial comparing isavuconazole with voriconazole for the treatment of IA and other filamentous fungi (SECURE) and the single-arm, open-label trial and case-control analysis of isavuconazole for the treatment of mucormycosis (VITAL). A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to estimate the combined parameter uncertainty, and a deterministic sensitivity analysis and a scenario analysis were performed to test the robustness of the model assumptions. The model followed a Swedish healthcare payer perspective, therefore only considering direct medical costs. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that isavuconazole resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 174,890 Swedish krona (SEK) per additional quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. This was mainly due to the efficacy of isavuconazole against IA and mucormycosis, as opposed to voriconazole, which is only effective against IA. Sensitivity and scenario analyses of the data showed that the average ICER consistently fell below the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 1,000,000 SEK. The probability of isavuconazole being cost-effective at a WTP of 170,000 SEK per QALY gained was 50% and at a WTP of 500,000 SEK per QALY gained was 100%.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Retrospective analysis. PATIENT SAMPLE: Patients who underwent either MD or ED for primary LDH with 1-year follow-up between the ages of 20 and 60 years old. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). METHODS: Five hundred sixty-five patients aged 20-60 years who underwent treatment using one of the four surgical techniques with at least 1-year follow-up were reviewed.

The study compared early versus deferred endovenous ablation for superficial venous truncal reflux in patients with a venous leg ulcer. The outcome measure was the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) over 1 year. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with alternative methods of handling missing data, alternative preference weights for health-related quality of life, and per protocol. RESULTS: After early intervention, the mean(s.e.m.) cost was higher (difference in cost per patient pound163(318) (euro184(358))) and early intervention was associated with more QALYs at 1 year (mean(s.e.m.) difference 0.041(0.017)). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound3976 (euro4482) per QALY. There was an 89 per cent probability that early venous intervention is cost-effective at a threshold of pound20 000 (euro22 546)/QALY. Sensitivity analyses produced similar results, confirming that early treatment of superficial reflux is highly likely to be cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Early treatment of superficial reflux is highly likely to be cost-effective in patients with venous leg ulcers over 1 year.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data were taken from the European Xultophy Treatment Retrospective Audit (EXTRA) real-world evidence study in which patients failing to meet glycaemic targets were switched to IDegLira. Baseline regimens (prior to IDegLira treatment) were categorized as: multiple daily insulin injections (MDI; 28%); glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists in combination with insulin (24%); basal insulin (19%); GLP-1 receptor agonists (10%); and non-injectable medications (19%). The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was used to project long-term outcomes for patients switching to IDegLira or continuing their baseline regimens (excluding non-injectable regimens). Costs were accounted from a Spanish National Health System perspective. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IDegLira was projected to reduce the incidence of diabetes-related complications and improve quality-adjusted life expectancy versus all four comparators. IDegLira reduced direct medical costs versus GLP-1 receptor agonists in combination with insulin, and versus GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy, and was therefore considered dominant (cost saving while improving outcomes). IDegLira was found to be cost-effective versus MDI and basal insulin with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of EUR 3013 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and EUR 6890 per QALY gained, respectively.

21327,A cost-utility analysis comparing large volume displacement oncoplastic surgery to mastectomy with free flap reconstruction in the treatment of breast cancer,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer surgical treatment may include large volume displacement oncoplastic surgery (LVOS) or mastectomy with free flap reconstruction (MFFR). We investigated the cost-utility between LVOS versus MFFR to determine which approach was most cost-effective. METHODS: A literature review was performed to calculate probabilities for clinical outcomes for each surgical option (LVOS versus MFFR), and to obtain utility scores that were converted into quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as measures for clinical effectiveness. Average Medicare payments were surrogates for cost. A decision tree was constructed and an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was used to calculate cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The decision tree demonstrates associated QALYs and costs with probabilities used to calculate the ICUR of $3699/QALY with gain of 2.7 QALY at an additional cost of $9987 proving that LVOS is a cost-effective surgical option. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that LVOS became cost-ineffective when its clinical effectiveness had a QALY of less than 30.187. Tornado Diagram Analysis and Monte-Carlo simulation supported our conclusion. CONCLUSION: LVOS is cost-effective when compared to MFFR for the appropriate breast cancer patient.

21328,Cost Effectiveness of Early Treatment with Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy in Adolescent Patients with Hepatitis C Virus Infection,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of early treatment with direct-acting antiviral therapy in adolescent patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection compared with treatment deferral. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a Markov model to assess the cost effectiveness of treating a hypothetical cohort of 30 000 adolescent patients with chronic HCV at age 12 years compared with deferring treatment until adulthood from a societal perspective. Model inputs for transition probabilities, HCV treatment and medical care costs, and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) utilities were derived from the literature and wholesale acquisition estimates. Deterministic sensitivity analyses varied parameters for non-HCV medical care and treatment cost, reinfection rates, treatment uptake, disease progression, liver transplant survival, and treatment with recently approved pangenotypic direct-acting antiviral agents. Discounted costs and total QALYs per person were quantified after 30 years. Cost effectiveness was evaluated as the incremental change in total medical costs per QALY gained. RESULTS: The incremental cost effectiveness of early treatment initiation compared with deferred treatment was approximately $27 000 per QALY gained after 30 years and considered cost effective. In a scenario analysis, hypothetical treatment initiation with currently available pangenotypic agents would be even more cost effective, ranging from $10 000 to $21 000 per QALY gained. Cost-effectiveness estimates were sensitive to variations in decompensated cirrhosis progression in adolescence, adult reinfection, and treatment uptake in adults.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of sequential treatment with abaloparatide (ABL) followed by alendronate (ALN) [(ABL/ALN)] compared with teriparatide (TPTD) followed by ALN (TPTD/ALN). METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was adapted to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequential ABL/ALN compared with sequential TPTD/ALN and no treatment with a lifetime horizon from the US payer perspective.

21333,Cost-Effectiveness of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Versus Multiple Daily Injections in Patients with Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetes in Finland,"INTRODUCTION: Although primarily utilized in type 1 diabetes, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) represents a useful treatment alternative for patients with type 2 diabetes who are unable to achieve good glycemic control despite optimization of multiple daily injections (MDI). The aim of the analysis reported here was to investigate the long-term cost-effectiveness of CSII versus MDI in type 2 diabetes patients with poor glycemic control in Finland. METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model was used to make long-term projections of the clinical and economic outcomes associated with CSII use in type 2 diabetes, based on clinical input data from the OpT2mise trial, which showed that CSII was associated with a 1.1% decrease in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with poor glycemic control at baseline. The analysis was performed from a societal perspective and the time horizon was that of patient lifetimes. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was associated with a gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.32 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with MDI (8.15 vs. 7.83 QALYs, respectively), as well as higher mean lifetime costs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Euro (EUR) 47,834 per QALY gained for CSII versus MDI. The higher treatment costs in the CSII group were partly mitigated by a 15% reduction in diabetes-related complication costs. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that CSII was most cost-effective in patients with the highest baseline HbA1c values. CONCLUSION: In Finland, CSII is likely to represent a cost-effective treatment alternative for patients with type 2 diabetes with poor glycemic control despite optimization of MDI.

Given the lack of independent analyses comparing numerous pharmacotherapies for osteoporosis, the study objective was to identify the optimal osteoporosis treatment based on a woman''s age, fracture history, and ability to tolerate oral bisphosphonates adopting practices recommended in the recently revised Canadian guidelines. Methods. A cost utility analysis from the health care system perspective compared alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, zoledronate, denosumab, and no pharmacotherapy using a Markov model incorporating data on fracture risk and their associated costs, mortality, and disutility and treatment effect. Stratified analysis was conducted based on age, fracture history, and ability to tolerate oral bisphosphonates.

21341,Adalimumab for non-infectious uveitis: is it cost-effective?,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Uveitis is inflammation inside the eye. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab compared with current practice (immunosuppressants and systemic corticosteroids) in patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior or panuveitis and to identify areas for future research. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate costs and benefits of the interventions. Systematic reviews were performed to identify the available relevant clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence. Data collected in two key randomised controlled trials (VISUAL I and VISUAL II) were used to estimate the interventions'' effectiveness compared with the trials'' comparator arms (placebo plus limited current practice (LCP)). The analysis was performed from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Costs were calculated based on standard UK sources. RESULTS: The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of adalimumab versus LCP for the base case are pound92 600 and pound318 075 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for active and inactive uveitis, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, the ICER varied from pound15 579 to pound120 653 and pound35 642 to pound800 775 per QALY for active and inactive uveitis. CONCLUSION: The estimated ICERs of adalimumab versus LCP are above generally accepted thresholds for cost-effectiveness in the UK. Adalimumab may be more cost-effective in patients with active uveitis at greater risk of blindness. However, there is an unmet need for additional primary data to provide more reliable estimates in several important areas, including effectiveness of adalimumab versus current practice (instead of LCP), incidence of long-term blindness, adalimumab effectiveness in avoiding blindness, and rates and time to remission while on adalimumab.",2019-01-30456,30728124,Br J Ophthalmol,Inigo Bermejo,2019,/,,No,30728124,"Inigo Bermejo; Hazel Squires; Edith N Poku; Katy Cooper; John W Stevens; Jean Hamilton; Ruth Wong; Ian Pearce; Fahd Mohammed Quhill; Alastair K Denniston; Adalimumab for non-infectious uveitis: is it cost-effective?, Br J Ophthalmol, 2019 Feb 11; ():0007-1161",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,adalimumab + limited current practice with active uveitis vs. Limited Current Practice,"active non-infectious intermediate, posterior or panuveitis, with more than 90% having bilateral uveitis",Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,92600,United Kingdom,2015,154554.2
21342,Intravitreal Ranibizumab for the Treatment of Visual Impairment Due to Choroidal Neovascularization Associated with Rare Diseases: Cost-Effectiveness in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab compared with best supportive care (BSC; considered to be no active treatment) for the treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with causes other than neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and pathologic myopia (PM) in a UK setting. METHODS: An individual patient-level simulation model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of ranibizumab vs. BSC. Regression analyses, performed on patient-level data collected within the pivotal phase III MINERVA trial, modelled visual acuity (VA) progression while patients remained on treatment. Patient utilities were modelled as a function of VA in both eyes and resource use estimates were based on trial data or the literature. Costs were evaluated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and personal social services, with future costs and health outcomes discounted at 3.5% per annum. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for intravitreal ranibizumab was pound1363 per QALY compared to BSC and was associated with an incremental benefit of 1.06 QALYs and an incremental cost of pound1444 per patient. Drug and administration costs of intravitreal ranibizumab were offset by the prevention of the development of blindness and its associated costs, while the increase in benefits was driven by a reduction in mortality risk and an improved health-related quality of life attributed to an improvement in VA. The findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses and ranibizumab consistently remained cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000-30,000 per QALY gained for all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Intravitreal ranibizumab is a highly cost-effective intervention for the treatment of CNV due to causes other than nAMD and PM as it delivers substantial QALY gains to patients while making cost savings vs. BSC.

21343,Cost-effectiveness of antidepressants versus active monitoring for mild-to-moderate major depressive disorder: a multisite non-randomized-controlled trial in primary care (INFAP study),"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antidepressants vs active monitoring (AM) for patients with mild-moderate major depressive disorder. METHODS: This was a 12-month observational prospective controlled trial. Adult patients with a new episode of major depression were invited to participate and assigned to AM or antidepressants according to General Practitioners'' clinical judgment and experience. Patients were evaluated at baseline, and 6 and 12-month follow-up. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were estimated and used to calculate incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) from the healthcare and government perspective. To minimize the bias resulting from non-randomization, a propensity score-based method was used. RESULTS: At 6 and 12-month follow-up, ICUR was 2549 euro/QALY and 6,142 euro/QALY, respectively, in favor of antidepressants. At 6 months, for a willingness to pay (WTP) of 25,000 euro/QALY, antidepressants had a probability of 0.89 (healthcare perspective) and 0.81 (government perspective) of being more cost-effective than AM. At 12 months, this probability was 0.86 (healthcare perspective) and 0.73 (government perspective). CONCLUSIONS: Incremental cost-utility ratios favor pharmacological treatment as a first-line approach for patients with mild-moderate major depressive disorder.

Patients were evaluated at baseline, and 6 and 12-month follow-up. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were estimated and used to calculate incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) from the healthcare and government perspective. To minimize the bias resulting from non-randomization, a propensity score-based method was used. RESULTS: At 6 and 12-month follow-up, ICUR was 2549 euro/QALY and 6,142 euro/QALY, respectively, in favor of antidepressants. At 6 months, for a willingness to pay (WTP) of 25,000 euro/QALY, antidepressants had a probability of 0.89 (healthcare perspective) and 0.81 (government perspective) of being more cost-effective than AM. At 12 months, this probability was 0.86 (healthcare perspective) and 0.73 (government perspective). CONCLUSIONS: Incremental cost-utility ratios favor pharmacological treatment as a first-line approach for patients with mild-moderate major depressive disorder.

21347,The cost-effectiveness of osteochondral allograft transplantation in the knee,"PURPOSE: Osteochondral allografts (OCA) consist of a layer of hyaline cartilage and a layer of underlying bone. They are used to repair combined defects of articular cartilage and bone. Such defects often occur in people far too young to have knee arthroplasty, for whom the main alternative to OCA is conservative symptomatic care, which will not prevent development of osteoarthritis. The aim of this report was to assess the cost-effectiveness of osteochondral allograft transplantation in the knee. METHODS: Systematic review of evidence on clinical effectiveness and economic modelling. RESULTS: The evidence on osteochondral allograft transplantation comes from observational studies, but often based on good quality prospective registries of all patients having such surgery. Without controlled trials, it was necessary to use historical cohorts to assess the effect of osteochondral grafts. There is good evidence that OCA are clinically effective with a high graft survival rate over 20 years. If an OCA graft fails, there is some evidence that revision with a second OCA is also effective, though less so than primary OCA. Economic modelling showed that osteochondral allograft transplantation was highly cost-effective, with costs per quality adjusted life year much lower than many other treatments considered cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Osteochondral allograft transplantation appears highly cost-effective though the cost per quality adjusted life year varies according to the widely varying costs of allografts. Based on one small study, revision OCA also appears very cost-effective, but more evidence is needed.

21348,Health-economic benefits of treating trauma in psychosis,"Background: Co-occurrence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in psychosis (estimated as 12%) raises personal suffering and societal costs. Health-economic studies on PTSD treatments in patients with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder have not yet been conducted, but are needed for guideline development and implementation. This study aims to analyse the cost-effectiveness of guideline PTSD therapies in patients with a psychotic disorder. Methods: This health-economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial included 155 patients with a psychotic disorder in care as usual (CAU), with comorbid PTSD. Participants received eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) (n = 55), prolonged exposure (PE) (n = 53) or waiting list (WL) (n = 47) with masked assessments at baseline (T0) and at the two-month (post-treatment, T2) and six-month follow-up (T6). Costs were calculated using the TiC-P interview for assessing healthcare consumption and productivity losses. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and economic acceptability were calculated for quality-adjusted life years (EQ-5D-3L-based QALYs) and PTSD ''Loss of diagnosis'' (LoD, CAPS). Results: Compared to WL, costs were lower in EMDR (-euro1410) and PE (-euro501) per patient per six months. In addition, EMDR (robust SE 0.024, t = 2.14, p = .035) and PE (robust SE 0.024, t = 2.14, p = .035) yielded a 0.052 and 0.051 incremental QALY gain, respectively, as well as 26% greater probability for LoD following EMDR (robust SE = 0.096, z = 2.66, p = .008) and 22% following PE (robust SE 0.098, z = 2.28, p = .023).

21352,Cost-effectiveness of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) at interval debulking of epithelial ovarian cancer following neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"OBJECTIVES: A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated an overall survival benefit to the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for stage III epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The objective of the current study was to quantify the cost-effectiveness of HIPEC in this setting. METHODS: A decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was designed from a payer perspective to compare 2 surgical management strategies for EOC: (1) interval cytoreductive surgery (ICS); (2) ICS+HIPEC. Overall survival and ostomy rates with HIPEC were modeled from published studies. We assumed that 25% of each arm would later undergo secondary cytoreductive surgery, with the ICS arm eligible for HIPEC at that time. Costs were obtained from Medicare data, published studies, and the financial department of an academic hospital. Quality of life was not different between the arms; we assigned utilities based on a prior time-trade off study of ovarian cancer treatment. A Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed in the base case; primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed in 2017 US Dollars/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: ICS was the least costly strategy at $78,849, compared to ICS+HIPEC at $79,954. ICS+HIPEC was more effective than ICS (2.9 QALYs versus 2.45 QALYs for ICS). ICS+HIPEC was highly cost-effective, with an ICER of $2436/QALY compared to ICS. In one-way sensitivity analyses, probability of ostomy reversal and use of HIPEC at secondary cytoreduction did not substantially impact the cost-effectiveness of ICS+HIPEC.

21353,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of HPV self-testing offered to non-attendees in cervical cancer screening in Switzerland,"OBJECTIVE: About 30% of women who are eligible for cervical cancer (CC) screening remain un-screened or under-screened in Switzerland. HPV testing on self-collected vaginal samples (Self-HPV) has shown to be more sensitive than cytology while also reaching non-attendees. The objective of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of offering Self-HPV to non-attendees in Switzerland. METHODS: A recursive decision-tree with one-year cycles was used to model the life-long natural HPV history. Markov cohort simulations were used to assess the expected outcomes from the model. The outcomes of three strategies were compared with the absence of screening: Self-HPV and triage with colposcopy (Self-HPV/colpo), Self-HPV and triage with Pap cytology (Self-HPV/PAP), cytological screening and triage with HPV (PAP/HPV). Sensitivity analyses for the key parameters of the model were conducted to check the robustness of findings. RESULTS: Offering a Self-HPV screening to non-attendees could prevent 90% of CC and 94% of CC-related deaths in the study population. The current cytology-based program could reduce by 83% the number of CC cases and by 88% the number of CC-related deaths over the population''s lifetime. Compared to the absence of screening, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated to be, per saved Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY), 12413US$ for the strategy Self-HPV/colpo, 11138US$ for the strategy Self-HPV/Pap and 22488US$ for the strategy PAP/HPV.

HPV testing on self-collected vaginal samples (Self-HPV) has shown to be more sensitive than cytology while also reaching non-attendees. The objective of this study was to explore the cost-effectiveness of offering Self-HPV to non-attendees in Switzerland. METHODS: A recursive decision-tree with one-year cycles was used to model the life-long natural HPV history. Markov cohort simulations were used to assess the expected outcomes from the model.

21359,Cost-utility of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients with cardiac arrest,"BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is a resource-intensive tool that provides haemodynamic and respiratory support in patients who have suffered cardiac arrest. In this study, we investigated the cost-utility of ECPR (cost/QALY) in cardiac arrest patients treated at our institution. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients who received ECPR following cardiac arrest between 2012 and 2018. All medical care-associated charges with ECPR and subsequent hospital admission were recorded. The quality-of-life of survivors was assessed with the Health Utilities Index Mark II. The cost-utility of ECPR was calculated with cost and quality-of-life data. RESULTS: ECPR was used in 32 patients (15/32 in-hospital, 47%) with a median age of 55.0 years (IQR 46.3-63.3 years), 59% male and 66% African American. The median duration of ECPR support was 2.1 days (IQR 0.9-3.8 days). Survival to hospital discharge was 16%. The median score of the Health Utilities Index Mark II at discharge for the survivors was 0.44 (IQR 0.32-0.52). The median operating cost for patients undergoing ECMO was $125,683 per patient (IQR $49,751-$206,341 per patient). The calculated cost-utility for ECPR was $56,156/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The calculated cost-utility is within the threshold considered cost-effective in the United States (<$150,000/QALY gained). These results are comparable to the cost-effectiveness of heart transplantation for end-stage heart failure. Larger studies are needed to assess the cost-utility of ECPR and to identify whether other factors, such as patient characteristics, affect the cost-utility benefit.",2019-01-30486,30716427,Resuscitation,Murtaza I Bharmal,2019,136 /,126-130,No,30716427,"Murtaza I Bharmal; Joseph M Venturini; Rhys F M Chua; Willard W Sharp; David G Beiser; Corey E Tabit; Taishi Hirai; Jonathan R Rosenberg; Janet Friant; John E A Blair; Jonathan D Paul; Sandeep Nathan; Atman P Shah; Cost-utility of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation in patients with cardiac arrest, Resuscitation, 2019 Mar; 136():0300-9572; 126-130",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,56156,United States,2018,57878.87
21360,Modelling the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Extended Screening and Treatment with Direct-Acting Antivirals in a Swiss Custodial Setting,"Background: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) amongst people living in detention (PLD) is typically high in many countries including Switzerland, where it is estimated that the HCV prevalence rate is between 5.7% and 6.2%. In Switzerland, the existing screening strategy involves routine screening of PLD who indicate they are from HCV high-risk populations based on questionnaire responses upon entry to the detention center, rather than an offer to screen all PLD. Methods: A cost-effectiveness analysis from a Swiss healthcare provider perspective was conducted by combining a five-year decision tree screening model with results from a Markov model of HCV treatment outcomes. This model explored the cost-effectiveness of increased HCV screening to cover all PLD compared to the current approach, using a standard test package and subsequent treatment with a single-tablet regimen in Swiss custodial settings. Sensitivity and scenario analyses examined the uncertainty of results. Results: At the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 100,000 Swiss Francs (CHF) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), comprehensive general screening was cost-effective compared to current risk-based screening, with a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CHF 14,312 per QALY. The net monetary benefit of screening the whole PLD population was CHF 23,298,046, and CHF 4,298 per person. The proportion of PLD tested was predicted to increase from 13.6% to 67.0% under comprehensive screening. Conclusion: The results showed that comprehensive screening strategies in detention centres in Switzerland can be cost-effective, with the probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimating an 82.3% probability of cost-effectiveness.",2019-01-30487,30715266,Clin Infect Dis,Francois Girardin,2019,/,,No,30715266,"Francois Girardin; Natalie Hearmon; Erika Castro; Francesco Negro; Lucy Eddowes; Laurent Getaz; Hans Wolff; Modelling the Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of Extended Screening and Treatment with Direct-Acting Antivirals in a Swiss Custodial Setting, Clin Infect Dis, 2019 Jun 18; ():1537-6591",QALY,Switzerland,Not Stated,Screening,hepatitis c screening vs. Standard/Usual Care- Hepatitis C screening for high-risk populations based on questionnaire responses,Living in detention,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,14312,Switzerland,2017,15353.47
21361,Cost Effectiveness of Nusinersen in the Treatment of Patients with Infantile-Onset and Later-Onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare neuromuscular disorder with a spectrum of severity related to age at onset and the number of SMN2 gene copies. Infantile-onset (</= 6 months of age) is the most severe spinal muscular atrophy and is the leading monogenetic cause of infant mortality; patients with later-onset (> 6 months of age) spinal muscular atrophy can survive into adulthood. Nusinersen is a new treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of nusinersen for the treatment of patients with infantile-onset spinal muscular atrophy and later-onset spinal muscular atrophy in Sweden. METHODS: One Markov cohort health-state transition model was developed for each population. The infantile-onset and later-onset models were based on the efficacy results from the ENDEAR phase III trial and the CHERISH phase III trial, respectively. The cost effectiveness of nusinersen in both models was compared with standard of care in Sweden. RESULTS: For a time horizon of 40 years in the infantile-onset model and 80 years in the later-onset model, treatment with nusinersen resulted in 3.86 and 9.54 patient incremental quality-adjusted life-years and 0.02 and 2.39 caregiver incremental quality-adjusted life-years and an incremental cost of 21.9 and 38.0 million SEK (Swedish krona), respectively. These results translated into incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (including caregiver quality-adjusted life-years) of 5.64 million SEK (euro551,300) and 3.19 million SEK (euro311,800) per quality-adjusted life-year gained in the infantile-onset model and later-onset model, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with nusinersen resulted in overall survival and quality-adjusted life-year benefits but with incremental costs above 21 million SEK (euro2 million) [mainly associated with maintenance treatment with nusinersen over a patient''s lifespan]. Nusinersen was not cost effective when using a willingness-to-pay threshold of 2 million SEK (euro195,600), which has been considered in a recent discussion by the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency as a reasonable threshold for rare disease.

21365,Cost-effectiveness of Insulin Degludec Versus Insulin Glargine in Insulin-naive Chinese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,"PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to investigate the long-term economic outcomes of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine use in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) whose oral antidiabetic drugs did not provide sufficient glycemic control. METHODS: A published and validated Chinese diabetes health policy model, which reflects Chinese T2DM epidemiologic profiles, was used to assess the lifetime economic outcomes of microvascular and macrovascular complications and mortality. Efficacy and safety, medical expenditure, and utility data were derived from the literature, which were assigned to model variables for estimating the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of Chinese health care service providers. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. FINDINGS: Compared with insulin glargine, insulin degludec was associated with 0.0053 QALY at an additional cost of $3278 in our simulated cohort. This outcome resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of insulin degludec over insulin glargine of $613,443 per QALY gained. The one-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were sensitive to several model inputs.

21366,The potential impact and cost-effectiveness of tobacco reduction strategies for tuberculosis prevention in Canadian Inuit communities,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant public health problem in Canadian Inuit communities. In 2016, Canadian Inuit had an incidence rate 35 times the Canadian average. Tobacco use is an important risk factor for TB, and over 60% of Inuit adults smoke. We aimed to estimate changes in TB-related outcomes and costs from reducing tobacco use in Inuit communities. METHODS: Using a transmission model to estimate the initial prevalence of latent TB infection (LTBI), followed by decision analysis modelling, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis that compared the current standard of care for management of TB and LTBI without additional tobacco reduction intervention (Status Quo) with (1) increased tobacco taxation, (2) pharmacotherapy and counselling for smoking cessation, (3) pharmacotherapy, counselling plus mass media campaign, and (4) the combination of all these. Projected outcomes included the following: TB cases, TB-related deaths, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and health system costs, all over 20 years. RESULTS: The combined strategy was projected to reduce active TB cases by 6.1% (95% uncertainty range 4.9-7.0%) and TB deaths by 10.4% (9.5-11.4%) over 20 years, relative to the status quo.

We previously reported that aprepitant, an NK1RA, was needed to control CINV in 43% and 12% of patients who received HEC and MEC, respectively (Support Care Cancer 23:905-912, 2015). To elucidate the cost-effectiveness of aprepitant in these patients, a cost-utility analysis according to the necessity of aprepitant was performed. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed according to the necessity of aprepitant and CINV responses in both acute and delayed phases of chemotherapy. Probabilities of health states and medical costs were derived from the results of the abovementioned trial. RESULT: In patients who received HEC and needed aprepitant, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with aprepitant, relative to the regimen with no aprepitant, was 7912 US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, which was far below the commonly accepted threshold of 50,000 USD/QALY.

21378,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Versus Sunitinib in First-Line Intermediate- to Poor-Risk Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: The treatment paradigm of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed rapidly in recent years. In first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk patients, the CheckMate 214 study demonstrated a significant survival advantage for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib. The high cost of combined immune-modulating agents warrants an understanding of the combination''s value by considering both efficacy and cost. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab compared with sunitinib for first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC from the U.S. payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab with those of sunitinib in the first-line treatment of intermediate- to poor-risk advanced RCC. Health outcomes were measured in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Drug costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates in 2017. We extrapolated survival beyond the trial closure using Weibull distribution. Model robustness was addressed in univariable and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The total mean cost per-patient of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib was $292,308 and $169,287, respectfully. Nivolumab and ipilimumab generated a gain of 0.978 QALYs over sunitinib. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for nivolumab and ipilimumab was $125,739/QALY versus sunitinib. CONCLUSION: Our analysis established that the base case ICER in the model for nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib is below what some would consider the upper limit of the theoretical willingness-to-pay threshold in the U.S. ($150,000/QALY) and is thus estimated to be cost-effective. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article assessed the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib for treatment of patients with intermediate- to poor-risk metastatic kidney cancer, from the U.S. payer perspective. It would cost $125,739 to gain 1 quality-adjusted life-year with nivolumab and ipilimumab versus sunitinib in these patients.",2019-01-30502,30710066,Oncologist,Daniel Reinhorn,2019,24 / 3,366-371,No,30710066,"Daniel Reinhorn; Michal Sarfaty; Moshe Leshno; Assaf Moore; Victoria Neiman; Eli Rosenbaum; Daniel A Goldstein; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Versus Sunitinib in First-Line Intermediate- to Poor-Risk Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma, Oncologist, 2019 Mar; 24(3):1083-7159; 366-371",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,nivolumab + ipilimumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- sunitinib,Intermediate to poor-risk,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,125739,United States,2017,132762.06
21379,Treating Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Uncontrolled on Basal Insulin in the Czech Republic: Cost-Effectiveness of IDegLira Versus iGlarLixi,"INTRODUCTION: Few patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) achieve recommended glycemic control targets in the Czech Republic. Novel therapies, such as fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, may contribute to better glycemic control. In the analysis presented here, the present analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of two fixed-ratio combinations, IDegLira (insulin degludec/liraglutide) and iGlarLixi (insulin glargine/lixisenatide), for the treatment of patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with basal insulin from a healthcare payer perspective in the Czech Republic. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effects were obtained from an indirect treatment comparison as no head-to-head data for IDegLira versus iGlarLixi are currently available. IDegLira was compared with two iGlarLixi pens (100 U/mL insulin glargine + 33 mug/mL and 50 mug/mL of lixisenatide, respectively). Direct medical costs associated with pharmaceutical interventions, screening and diabetes-related complications were captured. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with gains in life expectancy of 0.11 years and in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) versus iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative incidence and delayed onset of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was also associated with higher projected costs due to higher acquisition costs; however, these were partially offset by cost savings from avoided complications. IDegLira was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Czech Koruna (CZK) 695,998 and CZK 348,323 per QALY gained versus iGlarLixi pens containing 33 and 50 mug/mL of lixisenatide, respectively. These ratios were below the commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of CZK 1,200,000 per QALY gained.

21380,Treating Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Uncontrolled on Basal Insulin in the Czech Republic: Cost-Effectiveness of IDegLira Versus iGlarLixi,"INTRODUCTION: Few patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) achieve recommended glycemic control targets in the Czech Republic. Novel therapies, such as fixed-ratio combinations of basal insulin plus glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, may contribute to better glycemic control. In the analysis presented here, the present analysis assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of two fixed-ratio combinations, IDegLira (insulin degludec/liraglutide) and iGlarLixi (insulin glargine/lixisenatide), for the treatment of patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with basal insulin from a healthcare payer perspective in the Czech Republic. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Treatment effects were obtained from an indirect treatment comparison as no head-to-head data for IDegLira versus iGlarLixi are currently available. IDegLira was compared with two iGlarLixi pens (100 U/mL insulin glargine + 33 mug/mL and 50 mug/mL of lixisenatide, respectively). Direct medical costs associated with pharmaceutical interventions, screening and diabetes-related complications were captured. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with gains in life expectancy of 0.11 years and in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.14 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) versus iGlarLixi, due to a lower cumulative incidence and delayed onset of diabetes-related complications. IDegLira was also associated with higher projected costs due to higher acquisition costs; however, these were partially offset by cost savings from avoided complications. IDegLira was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of Czech Koruna (CZK) 695,998 and CZK 348,323 per QALY gained versus iGlarLixi pens containing 33 and 50 mug/mL of lixisenatide, respectively. These ratios were below the commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of CZK 1,200,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The present analysis indicated that IDegLira was associated with clinical benefits relative to iGlarLixi over patient lifetimes and was likely to be cost-effective in the treatment of patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin in the Czech Republic.

21381,Economic impact of potentially inappropriate prescribing and related adverse events in older people: a cost-utility analysis using Markov models,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the economic impact of three drugs commonly involved in potentially inappropriate prescribing (PIP) in adults aged >/=65 years, including their adverse effects (AEs): long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), benzodiazepines and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) at maximal dose; to assess cost-effectiveness of potential interventions to reduce PIP of each drug. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. We developed Markov models incorporating the AEs of each PIP, populated with published estimates of probabilities, health system costs (in 2014 euro) and utilities. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of 65 year olds analysed over 35 1-year cycles with discounting at 5% per year. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios with 95% credible intervals (CIs, generated in probabilistic sensitivity analysis) between each PIP and an appropriate alternative strategy. Models were then used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of potential interventions to reduce PIP for each of the three drug classes. RESULTS: All three PIP drugs and their AEs are associated with greater cost and fewer QALYs compared with alternatives. The largest reduction in QALYs and incremental cost was for benzodiazepines compared with no sedative medication (euro3470, 95% CI euro2434 to euro5001; -0.07 QALYs, 95% CI -0.089 to -0.047), followed by NSAIDs relative to paracetamol (euro806, 95% CI euro415 and euro1346; -0.07 QALYs, 95% CI -0.131 to -0.026), and maximal dose PPIs compared with maintenance dose PPIs (euro989, 95% CI -euro69 and euro2127; -0.01 QALYs, 95% CI -0.029 to 0.003). For interventions to reduce PIP, at a willingness-to-pay of euro45 000 per QALY, targeting NSAIDs would be cost-effective up to the highest intervention cost per person of euro1971. For benzodiazepine and PPI interventions, the equivalent cost was euro1480 and euro831, respectively.

21384,Targeted surgical prevention of epithelial ovarian cancer is cost effective and saves money in BRCA mutation carrying family members of women with epithelial ovarian cancer. A Canadian model,"OBJECTIVE: Survival but not cure rates have improved for epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), demonstrating the need for effective prevention. Targeted prevention in BRCA carriers by risk reducing surgery (RRS) prevents 80% of cases but incurs additional up-front costs, compensated for by the potential for long term savings from treatment avoidance. Does prevention represent value for money? In the absence of long-term data from prospective trials, determining the cost effectiveness of a prevention strategy requires economic modelling. METHODS: A patient level simulation was developed comparing outcomes between two groups, using Canadian data. Group 1: no mutation testing with treatment if EOC developed. Group 2: cascade testing (index patient BRCA tested and the first and second-degree relatives tested if index patient or first-degree relative respectively were positive) with RRS in carriers. End points were Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and budget impact. RESULTS: 2786 women with EOC (1year incidence) had 766 first and 207 second-degree female relatives. BRCA mutations were present in 390 index cases, 366 first and 49 second-degree relatives. With 100% RRS uptake, 59 EOC were prevented and testing dominated no testing (more effective and less costly; ICER -$8919). The total cost saving over 50years was $2,904,486 (cost saving of $9,660,381 in treatment costs versus increased cost from cascade testing/RRS of $6,755,895). At a threshold of $100,000 per QALY, prevention was cost effective in all modelled scenarios.

21385,The value of maintaining normokalaemia and enabling RAASi therapy in chronic kidney disease,"BACKGROUND: People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at an increased risk of developing hyperkalaemia due to their declining kidney function. In addition, these patients are often required to reduce or discontinue guideline-recommended renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor (RAASi) therapy due to increased risk of hyperkalaemia. This original research developed a model to quantify the health and economic benefits of maintaining normokalaemia and enabling optimal RAASi therapy in patients with CKD. METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was designed to fully characterise the natural history of CKD over a lifetime horizon, and predict the associations between serum potassium levels, RAASi use and long-term outcomes based on published literature. The clinical and economic benefits of maintaining sustained potassium levels and therefore avoiding RAASi discontinuation in CKD patients were demonstrated using illustrative, sensitivity and scenario analyses. RESULTS: Internal and external validation exercises confirmed the predictive capability of the model. Sustained potassium management and ongoing RAASi therapy were associated with longer life expectancy (+ 2.36 years), delayed onset of end stage renal disease (+ 5.4 years), quality-adjusted life-year gains (+ 1.02 QALYs), cost savings ( pound3135) and associated net monetary benefit ( pound23,446 at pound20,000 per QALY gained) compared to an absence of RAASi to prevent hyperkalaemia. CONCLUSION: This model represents a novel approach to predicting the long-term benefits of maintaining normokalaemia and enabling optimal RAASi therapy in patients with CKD, irrespective of the strategy used to achieve this target, which may support decision making in healthcare.",2019-01-30512,30704421,BMC Nephrol,Marc Evans,2019,20 / 1,31,No,30704421,"Marc Evans; Eirini Palaka; Hans Furuland; Hayley Bennett; Cecilia Linde; Lei Qin; Phil McEwan; Ameet Bakhai; The value of maintaining normokalaemia and enabling RAASi therapy in chronic kidney disease, BMC Nephrol, 2019 May 30; 20(1):1471-2369; 31",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,optimizing ongoing renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors therapy vs. Discontinuing Renin-angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors therapy,Stage 3a onwards,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-3103.96,United Kingdom,2014,-5593.79
21386,Cost-effectiveness of targeted screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in siblings,"Background: Population screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in 65-year-old men has been shown to be cost-effective. A risk group with higher prevalence is siblings of patients with an AAA. This health economic model-based study evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of targeted AAA screening of siblings. Methods: A Markov model validated against other screening programmes was used. Two methods of identifying siblings were analysed: direct questioning of patients with an AAA (method A), and employing a national multigeneration register (method B). The prevalence was based on observed ultrasound data on AAAs in siblings. Additional parameters were extracted from RCTs, vascular registers, literature and ongoing screening. The outcome was cost-effectiveness, probability of cost-effectiveness at different willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds, reduction in AAA death, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and total costs on a national scale. Results: Methods A and B were estimated to reduce mortality from AAA, at incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of euro7800 (95 per cent c.i. 4627 to 12 982) and euro7666 (5000 to 13 373) per QALY respectively. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 99 per cent at a WTP of euro23 000. The absolute risk reduction in AAA deaths was five per 1000 invited. QALYs gained were 27 per 1000 invited. In a population of ten million, methods A and B were estimated to prevent 12 and 17 AAA deaths, among 2418 and 3572 siblings identified annually, at total costs of euro499 500 and euro728 700 respectively.

INTRODUCTION: Gastro-resistant (GR) risedronate tablets are associated with improved persistence compared to common oral bisphosphonates but are slightly more expensive. This study assessed its cost-effectiveness compared to weekly alendronate and generic risedronate for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in France. METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was used to estimate the lifetime costs (expressed in euro2017) per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of GR risedronate compared with weekly alendronate, generic risedronate, and no treatment. Pooled efficacy data for bisphosphonates derived from a previous meta-analysis were used for all treatment options, and persistence data (up to 3 years) were obtained from a large Australian longitudinal study. Evaluation was done for high-risk women 60-80 years of age, with a bone mineral density (BMD) T-score </= - 2.5 and/or prevalent vertebral fractures. RESULTS: In all of the simulated populations, GR risedronate was cost-effective compared to alendronate, generic risedronate, and no treatment at a threshold of euro60,000 per QALY gained. In women with a BMD T-score </= - 2.5 and prevalent vertebral fractures, the cost per QALY gained of GR risedronate compared to alendronate, generic risedronate, and no treatment falls below euro20,000 per QALY gained. In women aged 75 years and older, GR risedronate was even shown to be dominant (more QALYs, less costs) compared to alendronate, generic risedronate, and no treatment.

21397,The cost-effectiveness of oral contraceptives compared to 'no hormonal treatment' for endometriosis-related pain: An economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a preliminary cost-effectiveness model that compares oral contraceptives and ''no hormonal treatment'' for the treatment of endometriosis-related pain. METHODS: A de novo preliminary state transition (Markov) model was developed. The model was informed by systematic literature review and expert opinion. The uncertainty around the results was assessed both by deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The economic evaluation was conducted from National Health Service (NHS) England perspective. The main outcome measure was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), with cost-effectiveness plane and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves presented for alternative willingness-to-pay thresholds. RESULTS: Oral contraceptives dominated ''no hormonal treatment'' and provided more QALYs at a lower cost than ''no hormonal treatment'', with a cost-effectiveness probability of 98%. A one-way sensitivity analysis excluding general practitioner consultations showed that oral contraceptives were still cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses showed that oral contraceptives could be an effective option for the treatment of endometriosis, as this treatment was shown to provide a higher level of QALYs at a lower cost, compared to ''no hormonal treatment''. The results are subject to considerable parameter uncertainty as a range of assumptions were required as part of the modelling process.",2019-01-30524,30699134,PLoS One,Tobias Sydendal Grand,2019,14 / 1,e0210089,No,30699134,"Tobias Sydendal Grand; Hasan Basarir; Louise J Jackson; The cost-effectiveness of oral contraceptives compared to 'no hormonal treatment' for endometriosis-related pain: An economic evaluation, PLoS One , 2019; 14(1):1932-6203; e0210089",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,oral contraceptives vs. None,Endometriosis,50 Years,32 Years,Female,Full,18 Years,3.50,3.50,-1381.4,United Kingdom,2017,-1880.11
21398,Genotype-guided thiopurine dosing does not lead to additional costs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,"Background and aims: Decreased thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) enzyme activity increases the risk of hematologic adverse drug reactions (ADR) in patients treated with thiopurines. Clinical studies have shown that in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pharmacogenetic TPMT-guided thiopurine treatment reduces this risk of ADR. The aim of this study was to investigate, whether this intervention impacts on healthcare costs and/or quality of life. Methods: An a priori defined cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in the Thiopurine response Optimization by Pharmacogenetic testing in Inflammatory bowel disease Clinics (TOPIC) trial, a randomized controlled trial performed in 30 Dutch hospitals. Patients diagnosed with IBD (age >/=18 years) were randomly assigned to the intervention (i.e. pre-treatment genotyping) or control group. Total costs in terms of volumes of care, and effects in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), based on EuroQol-5D3L utility scores, were measured for 20 weeks. Mean incremental cost savings and QALYs with confidence intervals were calculated using non-parametric bootstrapping with 1000 replications. Results: The intervention group consisted of 381 patients, the control group had 347 patients. The mean incremental cost savings were euro52 per patient (95% percentiles -682, 569). Mean incremental QALYs were 0.001 (95% percentiles -0.009, 0.010). Sensitivity analysis showed that results were robust for potential change in costs of screening, costs of biologicals, and costs associated with productivity loss. Conclusions: Genotype-guided thiopurine treatment in IBD patients reduced the risk of ADR among patients carrying a TPMT variant, without increasing overall healthcare costs and resulting in comparable quality of life, as compared to standard treatment.",2019-01-30526,30698675,J Crohns Colitis,Reinier L Sluiter,2019,/,,No,30698675,"Reinier L Sluiter; Corine van Marrewijk; Dirk de Jong; Hans Scheffer; Henk-Jan Guchelaar; Luc Derijks; Dennis R Wong; Piet Hooymans; Sita H Vermeulen; Andre L M Verbeek; Barbara Franke; Gert Jan van der Wilt; Wietske Kievit; Marieke J H Coenen; Genotype-guided thiopurine dosing does not lead to additional costs in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, J Crohns Colitis , 2019 Mar 20; ():1876-4479",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Screening",personalized thiopurine dosing based on pre-treatment tpmt genotyping vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard treatment according to IBD guidelines,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-51000,Euro,2016,-60856.08
21399,Estimating the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness profile of a nonavalent HPV vaccine in Spain,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the main causes of infection-related cancer. The bivalent vaccine (2vHPV) (16/18) and quadrivalent (6/11/16/18) HPV vaccine (4vHPV) have been included in the Spanish vaccination calendar since 2007. The new nonavalent HPV vaccine (9vHPV), approved in Europe in 2015, includes nine HPV types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 and has been available in Spain since May 2017. Our study aims to estimate the epidemiological impact and the cost-effectiveness of a girls-only and a gender-neutral vaccination program with 9vHPV compared to the current vaccination program in Spain.
