13101,Cost utility of telaprevir-PR (peginterferon-ribavirin) versus boceprevir-PR and versus PR alone in chronic hepatitis C in The Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: The hepatitis C virus may lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver transplant, and increased mortality. With standard treatment peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin (PR), sustained viral response (SVR) was less than 50 %. SVR rates improve greatly when PR is combined with telaprevir or boceprevir. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the cost utility of telaprevir-peginterferon-ribavirin (TPR) versus PR and boceprevir-peginterferon-ribavirin (BPR) in treatment-naive (TN) and treatment-experienced (TE) adults with chronic hepatitis C in the Netherlands. METHODS: A Markov model with a lifelong time horizon and annual cycles was developed. Clinical data stemmed from phase III trials (TPR vs PR, BPR vs PR). A mixed treatment comparison (MTC) was developed to compare TPR and BPR indirectly. Unit costs and utilities based on EQ-5D were established in a Dutch cross-sectional study. Cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was calculated according to the societal perspective. RESULTS: Treating TN patients with TPR generates 1.12 additional QALYs with euro333 additional cost compared with PR, resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio of euro299/QALY. In TE patients, TPR dominates PR with cost savings (-euro7,819) and 1.63 additional QALYs. TPR dominates BPR yielding additional QALYs (0.26 in TN; 0.71 in TE) and cost savings (-euro7,296, -euro18,144, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: TPR seems a cost-effective alternative to PR in TN patients and dominant in TE patients. TPR was a dominant, more effective and less costly alternative to BPR in both patient types. The cost effectiveness of both TPR and BPR is well below generally accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds and may be considered cost effective.",2014-01-16078,25103219,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Aikaterini Vellopoulou,2014,12 / 6,647-59,Yes,25103219,"Aikaterini Vellopoulou; Michel van Agthoven; Annemarie van der Kolk; Robert J de Knegt; Gilles Berdeaux; Sandrine Cure; Florence Bianic; Mark Lamotte; Cost utility of telaprevir-PR (peginterferon-ribavirin) versus boceprevir-PR and versus PR alone in chronic hepatitis C in The Netherlands, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 12(6):1179-1896; 647-59",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Telaprevir regimen vs. Boceprevir regimen: 4 weeks of PR are followed by BPR (boceprevir 800 mg three times daily ?

13106,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of dabigatran etexilate versus warfarin in atrial fibrillation in different age subgroups,"This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran 150 mg twice daily versus warfarin for stroke and systemic embolism risk reduction in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation initiating treatment before age 75 (<75), at or after age 75 (>/= 75), and the overall population (All) from a US Medicare payer perspective. Clinical event rates by age cohort with dabigatran or warfarin for safety-on-treatment and intent-to-treat populations were estimated from Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY). An economic model was adapted using these data to evaluate the impact of starting age on clinical and economic outcomes. Costs were obtained from Medicare payment schedules and utilities from publications. Model outputs included event rates, costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The RE-LY analysis shows that the <75 cohort has lower rates of all events than the >/= 75 cohort; versus warfarin, dabigatran performed better in main efficacy and safety in all age cohorts with the exception of extracranial hemorrhage in the >/= 75 cohort. The clinical event costs avoided per patient for dabigatran were $1,100, $135, and $713 for cohorts <75, >/= 75, and All, respectively. Extrapolating over a lifetime horizon, the model found that dabigatran resulted in lower rates of stroke and intracranial hemorrhage and higher rates for extracranial hemorrhage versus warfarin for all age cohorts. Lifetime quality-adjusted life-years and costs were higher for dabigatran than warfarin, resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $52,773, $65,946, and $56,131 for cohorts <75, >/= 75, and All, respectively.

13107,Cost-effectiveness of routine surveillance endomyocardial biopsy after 12 months post-heart transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Despite low risk of late rejection after heart transplant (HT), surveillance endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) are often continued for years. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of routine EMB after 12 months post-HT. METHODS AND RESULTS: Markov model compared the following surveillance EMB strategies to baseline strategy of stopping EMB 12 months post-HT: (1) every 4 months during year 2 post-HT, (2) every 6 months during year 2, (3) every 4 months for years 2 to 3, and (4) every 6 months for years 2 to 3. Patients entered the model 12 months post-HT and were followed until 36 months. In all strategies, patients had EMB with symptoms; in biopsy strategies after 12 months, EMB was also performed as scheduled regardless of symptoms. One-way and Monte Carlo sensitivity analyses were performed. Stopping EMB at 12 months was dominant (more effective, less costly), saving $2884 per patient compared with the next best strategy (every 6 months for year 2) and gaining 0.0011 quality-adjusted life-years. Increasing the annual risk of asymptomatic rejection in years 2 to 3 from previously reported 2.5% to 8.5% resulted in the biopsy every 6 months for year 2 strategy gaining 0.0006 quality-adjusted life-years, but cost $4 913 599 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. EMB for 12 months was also no longer dominant when mortality risk from untreated asymptomatic rejection approached 11%; competing strategies still cost >$200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year as that risk approached 99%. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance EMB for 12 months post-HT is more effective and less costly than EMB performed after 12 months, unless risks of asymptomatic cellular rejection and its mortality are strikingly higher than previously observed.",2014-01-16083,25104042,Circ Heart Fail,Brent C Lampert,2014,7 / 5,807-13,No,25104042,"Brent C Lampert; Jeffrey J Teuteberg; Michael A Shullo; Jonathan Holtz; Kenneth J Smith; Cost-effectiveness of routine surveillance endomyocardial biopsy after 12 months post-heart transplantation, Circ Heart Fail , ; 7(5):1941-3297; 807-13",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Stopping endomyocardial biopsies 12 months post heart transplant vs. Endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) every 6 months for year 2 post-HT,Post heart transplant (HT),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,36 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2621818.18,United States,2010,-3111840.01
13108,Low-dose chest computed tomography for lung cancer screening among Hodgkin lymphoma survivors: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors face an increased risk of treatment-related lung cancer. Screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) may allow detection of early stage, resectable cancers. We developed a Markov decision-analytic and cost-effectiveness model to estimate the merits of annual LDCT screening among HL survivors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Population databases and HL-specific literature informed key model parameters, including lung cancer rates and stage distribution, cause-specific survival estimates, and utilities. Relative risks accounted for radiation therapy (RT) technique, smoking status (>10 pack-years or current smokers vs not), age at HL diagnosis, time from HL treatment, and excess radiation from LDCTs. LDCT assumptions, including expected stage-shift, false-positive rates, and likely additional workup were derived from the National Lung Screening Trial and preliminary results from an internal phase 2 protocol that performed annual LDCTs in 53 HL survivors. We assumed a 3% discount rate and a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Annual LDCT screening was cost effective for all smokers. A male smoker treated with mantle RT at age 25 achieved maximum QALYs by initiating screening 12 years post-HL, with a life expectancy benefit of 2.1 months and an incremental cost of $34,841/QALY. Among nonsmokers, annual screening produced a QALY benefit in some cases, but the incremental cost was not below the WTP threshold for any patient subsets. As age at HL diagnosis increased, earlier initiation of screening improved outcomes. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the model was most sensitive to the lung cancer incidence and mortality rates and expected stage-shift from screening. CONCLUSIONS: HL survivors are an important high-risk population that may benefit from screening, especially those treated in the past with large radiation fields including mantle or involved-field RT.

13110,Cost-effectiveness of boceprevir co-administration versus pegylated interferon-alpha2b and ribavirin only for patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 in Singapore,"BACKGROUND: Patients infected with chronic HCV genotype 1 experience liver complications as the disease progresses. This study aims to project the long-term reduction of liver complications and cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies, including co-administrating boceprevir (BOC) with pegylated interferon-alpha2b (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin compared with standard of care (SOC) of PEG-IFN and ribavirin only. METHODS: A Markov model was created to estimate the expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with treatment strategies outlined in the BOC package insert in Singapore. Patient characteristics were from pivotal trials, the transition probabilities and QALYs were estimated from publications, and the pharmaceutical and health status costs were obtained from a public hospital in Singapore. The threshold of cost-effectiveness was chosen as 65,000 SGD for this study. RESULTS: For treatment-naive patients, BOC is highly cost-effective compared with SOC (179 SGD/QALY) and cost-saving for patients who have failed prior treatment, due to higher QALYs from better sustained virological response (SVR) and lower costs from avoidance of complications. Sub-group analyses show that BOC is cost-effective for non-cirrhotic treatment-experienced patients and null responders. It out-performs SOC for treatment-naive non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients who have failed prior treatment. Even after adjusting for higher prevalence of favourable IL28B genotype in Asians, BOC is cost-effective compared with SOC. Only untreated cirrhotic patients showed inconclusive cost-effectiveness for BOC. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with SOC, BOC prevents more HCV liver complications from HCV genotype 1, particularly in patients who have failed previous SOC. Improved SVR and shortened duration of treatment result in BOC being potentially cost-saving or cost-effective in an Asian population.",2014-01-16085,25105844,Antivir Ther,Yock Young Dan,2015,20 / 2,,No,25105844,"Yock Young Dan; Shannon A Ferrante; Elamin H Elbasha; Tun-Ying Hsu; Cost-effectiveness of boceprevir co-administration versus pegylated interferon-alpha2b and ribavirin only for patients with hepatitis C genotype 1 in Singapore, Antivir Ther, 2015; 20(2):1359-6535",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Boceprevir co-administration vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,179,Singapore,2013,158.98
13111,Arthroscopy for mechanical symptoms in osteoarthritis: a cost-effective procedure,"PURPOSE: The place of knee arthroscopy as a therapeutic option for osteoarthritis (OA) has been the subject of some debate. The hypothesis for this study was that arthroscopic debridement is beneficial in patients with OA who have significant mechanical symptoms. METHODS: Forty-three patients with radiological OA on plain radiographs and mechanical symptoms were prospectively followed. No further imaging was obtained. They were assessed pre- and postoperatively with an Oxford Knee Score (OKS) and pain visual analogue score (VAS). Postoperative patient satisfaction was measured with a VAS. A cost-benefit analysis was performed using a transformed OKS to generate a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measurement. RESULTS: At a mean of 1.5 years, seven patients (16 %) had undergone total knee arthroplasty at a mean of 8.2 months postarthroscopy. For the remaining 35 patients, there were significant improvements in pain (median 7-5, p < 0.05) and OKS (median 24-36.5, p < 0.05). Satisfaction was a median 6.2 for all patients. The mean calculated EQ-5D improved from 0.43 (SD 0.16) to 0.79 (SD 0.23), which gave a gain of 0.52 QALYs in the study period. This generated a cost per QALY of pound2,088, well below the threshold of pound30,000 quoted by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as demonstration of cost-effective treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study demonstrates that although not universally effective, arthroscopic debridement for patients with knee OA and mechanical symptoms can result in significant improvements in pain and function. The procedure gave good patient satisfaction, and even at an early follow-up period proves to be cost-effective.

13112,Cost-effectiveness of nurse-based case management versus usual care for elderly patients with myocardial infarction: results from the KORINNA study,"OBJECTIVES: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of a case management intervention by trained nurses in elderly (>/=65 years) patients with myocardial infarction from a societal perspective. METHODS: The intervention and observation period spanned 1 year and 329 participants were enrolled. The intervention consisted of at least one home visit and quarterly telephone calls. Data on resource use and quality of life were collected quarterly. The primary measurements of effect were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), based on the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) health utilities from the German time trade-off. The secondary measurements were EQ-5D-3L utility values and patients' self-rated health states according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) among survivors. To estimate mean differences, a linear regression model was used for QALYs and a gamma model for costs. Health states among the survivors were analysed using linear mixed models. To assess the impact of different health state valuation methods, VAS-adjusted life years were constructed. RESULTS: The mean difference in QALYs was small and not significant (-0.0163; CI -0.0681-0.0354, p value: 0.536, n = 297). Among survivors, EQ-5D-3L utilities showed significant improvements within 6 months in the intervention group (0.051; CI 0.0028-0.0989; p value: 0.0379, n = 280) but returned towards baseline levels by month 12. The mean improvement in self-rated health (VAS) within 1 year was significantly larger in the intervention group (+9.2, CI 4.665-13.766, p value: <0.0001, n = 266). The overall cost difference was -<euro>17.61 (CI - <euro>2,601-<euro>2,615; p value: 0.9856, n = 297). The difference in VAS-adjusted life years was 0.0378 (CI -0.0040-0.0796, p value: 0.0759, n = 297).

13113,"Costs, consequences, and cost-effectiveness of strategies for Babesia microti donor screening of the US blood supply","BACKGROUND: Babesia microti is regarded as the foremost infectious risk to the US blood supply for which a regulatory-approved screening test is unavailable. More than 160 cases of transfusion-transmitted Babesia microti (TTB) have been reported to date, yet there is little consensus regarding a mitigation strategy. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study sought to assess the cost-utility of donation screening by mode of testing (immunofluorescence assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], polymerase chain reaction [PCR], and combinations thereof) as well as extent of geographic inclusion (4-state, 7-state, 20-state, or national screening). A discrete-time Markov cohort model to simulate the outcomes of B. microti infection and survival of the transfused population was developed. Seroprevalence was estimated by extrapolating babesiosis claims from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services and reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Test performance was estimated from clinical diagnostics and limited donor screening studies, while transmissibility was estimated as a weighted average of three studies. Results are reported as the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for each strategy compared to no screening. RESULTS: Given model inputs, 4-state and 7-state ELISA in combination with PCR would cost $5.2 million and $6.6 million/QALY, respectively.

13118,Cascade screening based on genetic testing is cost-effective: evidence for the implementation of models of care for familial hypercholesterolemia,"BACKGROUND: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) imposes significant burden of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of FH detection based on genetic testing, supplemented with the measurement of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, and treatment with statins. METHODS: A Markov model with a 10-year time horizon was constructed to simulate the onset of first-ever CHD and death in close relatives of probands with genetically confirmed FH. The model comprised of 3 health states: ""alive without CHD,"" ""alive with CHD,"" and ""dead."" Decision-analysis compared the clinical consequences and costs of cascade-screening vs no-screening from an Australian health care perspective. The annual risk of CHD and benefits of treatment was estimated from a cohort study. The underlying prevalence of FH, sensitivity, specificity, cost of screening, treatment, and clinic follow-up visits were derived from a cascade screening service for FH in Western Australia. An annual discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. RESULTS: The model estimated that screening for FH would reduce the 10-year incidence of CHD from 50.0% to 25.0% among people with FH. Of every 100 people screened, there was an overall gain of 24.95 life-years and 29.07 quality-adjusted life years (discounted). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was in Australian dollars, $4155 per years of life saved and $3565 per quality-adjusted life years gained. CONCLUSION: This analysis within an Australian context, demonstrates that cascade screening for FH, using genetic testing supplemented with the measurement of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and treatment with statins, is a cost-effective means of preventing CHD in families at risk of FH.",2014-01-16094,25110220,J Clin Lipidol,Zanfina Ademi,2014,8 / 4,390-400,No,25110220,"Zanfina Ademi; Gerald F Watts; Jing Pang; Eric J G Sijbrands; Frank M van Bockxmeer; Peter O'Leary; Elizabeth Geelhoed; Danny Liew; Cascade screening based on genetic testing is cost-effective: evidence for the implementation of models of care for familial hypercholesterolemia, J Clin Lipidol, ; 8(4):1933-2874; 390-400",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cascade screening vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,3565,Australia,2013,3835.11
13119,Cost-utility analysis of a treatment advice to discontinue inappropriate long-term antidepressant use in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Antidepressant prescriptions have increased exponentially, burdening health care costs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the costs and effects of an antidepressant cessation advice in case of inappropriate long-term use in primary care, i.e. long-term usage without a (current) indication. METHODS: A economic evaluation during 1-year follow-up was performed, from a societal perspective, as part of a cluster-randomised controlled clinical trial (PANDA). Costs were assessed using the Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for costs associated with psychiatric illness. Health-related quality of life was measured using the EuroQol 5D. Outcome was costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Missing values were estimated using multiple imputation, bootstrap simulations were performed to address the uncertainty surrounding the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: There was no difference in average QALYs between the intervention (0.70) and control group (0.72) [difference -0.02 (95% CI -0.05 to 0.10)]. The intervention group, however, was less expensive than the control group (total costs euro3636 versus euro5267, respectively). Most cost-effectiveness pairs were located in the south-west quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane, implying the intervention was less effective but also less costly. The ICER of the pooled data was euro70,180, meaning that for one QALY lost, euro70,180 is saved. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that an antidepressant cessation advice given to patients (and their FPs) with inappropriate long-term antidepressant usage, albeit not effective, does seem to result in a reduction of societal costs. This reduction in costs is mostly due to reduction of productivity losses, possibly due to patient empowerment and loss of stigma.",2014-01-16116,25121977,Fam Pract,Rhona Eveleigh,2014,31 / 5,578-84,No,25121977,"Rhona Eveleigh; Janneke Grutters; Esther Muskens; Richard Oude Voshaar; Chris van Weel; Anne Speckens; Peter Lucassen; Cost-utility analysis of a treatment advice to discontinue inappropriate long-term antidepressant use in primary care, Fam Pract, ; 31(5):0263-2136; 578-84",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Advice: discontinuation of inappropriate used of antidepressants vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,56 Years,56 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,81550,Euro,2012,118207.39

DESIGN: A within-trial cost-utility analysis with a 2-year time horizon, based on a multicentre factorial, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 23 hospital ophthalmology clinics. PARTICIPANTS: 610 patients aged >/=50 years with untreated nAMD in the study eye. INTERVENTIONS: 0.5 mg ranibizumab or 1.25 mg bevacizumab given continuously (monthly) or discontinuously (as-needed) for 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Total 2-year costs ranged from pound3002/patient ($4700; 95% CI pound2601 to pound3403) for discontinuous bevacizumab to pound18 590/patient ($29 106; 95% CI pound18 258 to pound18 922) for continuous ranibizumab. Ranibizumab was significantly more costly than bevacizumab for both continuous (+ pound14 989/patient ($23 468); 95% CI pound14 522 to pound15 456; p<0.001) and discontinuous treatment (+ pound8498 ($13 305); 95% CI pound7700 to pound9295; p<0.001), with negligible difference in QALYs. Continuous ranibizumab would only be cost-effective compared with continuous bevacizumab if the NHS were willing to pay pound3.5 million ($5.5 million) per additional QALY gained. Patients receiving continuous bevacizumab accrued higher total costs (+ pound599 ($938); 95% CI pound91 to pound1107; p=0.021) than those receiving discontinuous bevacizumab, but also accrued non-significantly more QALYs (+0.020; 95% CI -0.032 to 0.071; p=0.452). Continuous bevacizumab therefore cost pound30 220 ($47 316) per QALY gained versus discontinuous bevacizumab. However, bootstrapping demonstrated that if the NHS is willing to pay pound20 000/QALY gained, there is a 37% chance that continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective versus discontinuous bevacizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab is not cost-effective compared with bevacizumab, being substantially more costly and producing little or no QALY gain.

Ranibizumab was significantly more costly than bevacizumab for both continuous (+ pound14 989/patient ($23 468); 95% CI pound14 522 to pound15 456; p<0.001) and discontinuous treatment (+ pound8498 ($13 305); 95% CI pound7700 to pound9295; p<0.001), with negligible difference in QALYs. Continuous ranibizumab would only be cost-effective compared with continuous bevacizumab if the NHS were willing to pay pound3.5 million ($5.5 million) per additional QALY gained. Patients receiving continuous bevacizumab accrued higher total costs (+ pound599 ($938); 95% CI pound91 to pound1107; p=0.021) than those receiving discontinuous bevacizumab, but also accrued non-significantly more QALYs (+0.020; 95% CI -0.032 to 0.071; p=0.452). Continuous bevacizumab therefore cost pound30 220 ($47 316) per QALY gained versus discontinuous bevacizumab. However, bootstrapping demonstrated that if the NHS is willing to pay pound20 000/QALY gained, there is a 37% chance that continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective versus discontinuous bevacizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Ranibizumab is not cost-effective compared with bevacizumab, being substantially more costly and producing little or no QALY gain. Discontinuous bevacizumab is likely to be the most cost-effective of the four treatment strategies evaluated in this UK trial, although there is a 37% chance that continuous bevacizumab is cost-effective.

DESIGN: A within-trial cost-utility analysis with a 2-year time horizon, based on a multicentre factorial, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 23 hospital ophthalmology clinics.

13124,Teleneurology in stroke management: costs of service in different organizational models,"Telemedicine is in increasing use in clinical neuroscience such as acute stroke care, especially by applying remote audiovisual communication for patient evaluation. However, telephone consultation was also used linking stroke centres to smaller hospitals. We compared costs of telestroke services using audiovisual and telephone communication in different organizational models. Within a small network in Northern Bavaria video-based teleconsultation (VTC) and telephone advice (TA) was provided for evaluation of acute stroke patients on a weekly rotation. The costs of the admissions process with or without one of both methods of telemedicine were calculated and compared from the perspective of the spoke hospital. Different levels of service and network size were modelled and costs of transfers as well as loss of revenues were calculated. Yearly total labour costs were 415,000 euro for an on-site service VTC-service compared to 61,000 euro in an on-call service. Additional costs for one teleconsultation were 109.55 euro in VTC and 49.82 euro in TA (VTC/TA ratio 2.2). The ratio decreased to 0.8 when accounting for costs of transfer and loss of reimbursement for all patients transferred as transfer of patients to the stroke centre was more frequent after TA (9.1 vs. 14.9%full-time on-site ser). Costs of one QALY gained by using VTC instead of TA ranged from 115.00 euro to 515.86 euro depending on the different models. In the first view TA looks like the less expensive method as it is easy to access and works without additional costs. When accounting for all disadvantages TA becomes slightly more expensive. In telestroke care VTC should be recommended as the method of choice also from an economic perspective.",2014-01-16135,25082628,J Neurol,Rene Handschu,2014,261 / 10,2003-8,No,25082628,"Rene Handschu; Mateusz Scibor; Martin Nuckel; Dirk Asshoff; Barbara Willaczek; Frank Erbguth; Stefan Schwab; Frank Daumann; Teleneurology in stroke management: costs of service in different organizational models, J Neurol, ; 261(10):0340-5354; 2003-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Video-based teleconsultation vs. Telephone advice (TA),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,515.86,Euro,2012,747.74
13125,Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stents versus bypass surgery for patients with 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease: final results from the Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) trial,"BACKGROUND: The Synergy Between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With TAXUS and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) trial demonstrated that in patients with 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) was associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, or repeat revascularization compared with percutaneous coronary revascularization with drug-eluting stents (DES-PCI)). The long-term cost-effectiveness of these strategies is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2007, 1800 patients with left main or 3-vessel coronary artery disease were randomized to CABG (n=897) or DES-PCI (n=903). Costs were assessed from a US perspective, and health state utilities were evaluated with the EuroQOL questionnaire. A patient-level microsimulation model based on the 5-year in-trial data was used to extrapolate costs, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy over a lifetime horizon. Although initial procedural costs were $3415 per patient lower with CABG, total hospitalization costs were $10 036 per patient higher. Over the next 5 years, follow-up costs were higher with DES-PCI as a result of more frequent hospitalizations, revascularization procedures, and higher medication costs. Over a lifetime horizon, CABG remained more costly than DES-PCI, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was favorable ($16 537 per quality-adjusted life-year gained) and remained <$20 000 per quality-adjusted life-year in most bootstrap replicates. Results were consistent across a wide range of assumptions about the long-term effect of CABG versus DES-PCI on events and costs. In patients with left main disease or a SYNTAX score </=22, however, DES-PCI was economically dominant compared with CABG, although these findings were less certain. CONCLUSIONS: For most patients with 3-vessel or left main coronary artery disease, CABG is a clinically and economically attractive revascularization strategy compared with DES-PCI. However, among patients with less complex disease, DES-PCI may be preferred on both clinical and economic grounds. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.

13126,Cost effectiveness of renal denervation therapy for the treatment of resistant hypertension in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Patients with resistant hypertension are at a high risk for developing serious cardiovascular events and renal complications. Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) is a procedure with the potential to normalize systolic blood pressure (SBP). OBJECTIVE: The overall objective of the study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of RDN in the UK for patients with diagnosed resistant hypertension, expressed as a standard cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) ratio. METHODS: A patient lifetime, economic, Markov heath-state model was developed, linking expected changes in SBP to reductions in risks for cardiovascular events and renal complications, using the Framingham, PROCAM, and other published risk equations. The model was developed from the perspective of the healthcare payer in the UK using relevant cost data from 2012. Clinical effectiveness for RDN (a mean reduction of 32 mmHg in SBP) was taken from the phase III Symplicity HTN-2 trial, in patients with a mean baseline SBP of 178 mmHg. HTN-2 was the largest, multicenter randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of RDN therapy at the time of the model development. A systematic review identified UK-specific sources for utility, mortality, and cost parameter values, and included recently published UK guidelines for the clinical management of hypertension. RESULTS: RDN therapy resulted in an increase in health benefit over a patient's lifetime compared with anti-hypertensive pharmacological treatment alone (12.77 vs. 12.16 QALYs; discounted). Additional lifetime costs per patient were modeled at pound2,961; equivalent to an incremental cost per additional QALY of pound4,805. This result was robust to full probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses. CONCLUSION: RDN is an effective clinical procedure that offers patients a meaningful and cost-effective alternative for achieving SBP control, where traditional combination, anti-hypertensive pharmacologic strategies have been proven to be ineffective.",2014-01-16144,25086585,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Daniel Gladwell,2014,12 / 6,611-22,Yes,25086585,"Daniel Gladwell; Thea Henry; Mark Cook; Ron Akehurst; Cost effectiveness of renal denervation therapy for the treatment of resistant hypertension in the UK, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 12(6):1179-1896; 611-22",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Catheter-based renal denervation to normalize systolic blood pressure vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 10 years",3.50,3.50,4805,United Kingdom,2012,8586.85
13127,Cost-effectiveness of initial diagnostic strategies for pulmonary nodules presenting to thoracic surgeons,"BACKGROUND: Patients presenting to thoracic surgeons with pulmonary nodules suggestive of lung cancer have varied diagnostic options including navigation bronchoscopy (NB), computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration (CT-FNA), (18)F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We studied the relative cost-effective initial diagnostic strategy for a 1.5- to 2-cm nodule suggestive of cancer. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed to assess the costs and outcomes of four initial diagnostic strategies for diagnosis of a 1.5- to 2-cm nodule with either a 50% or 65% pretest probability of cancer. Medicare reimbursement rates were used for costs. Quality-adjusted life years were estimated using patient survival based on pathologic staging and utilities derived from the literature. RESULTS: When cancer prevalence was 65%, tissue acquisition strategies of NB and CT-FNA had higher quality-adjusted life years compared with either FDG-PET or VATS, and VATS was the most costly strategy. In sensitivity analyses, NB and CT-FNA were more cost-effective than FDG-PET when FDG-PET specificity was less than 72%. When cancer prevalence was 50%, NB, CT-FNA, and FDG-PET had similar cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Both NB and CT-FNA diagnostic strategies are more cost-effective than either VATS biopsy or FDG-PET scan to diagnose lung cancer in moderate- to high-risk nodules and resulted in fewer nontherapeutic operations when FDG-PET specificity was less than 72%.

13130,A risk-profiling approach for surveillance of inflammatory bowel disease-colorectal carcinoma is more cost-effective: a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis between international guidelines,"BACKGROUND: Colonoscopic surveillance for neoplasia is recommended for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related colitis. However, data on cost-effectiveness predate current international guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To compare cost-effectiveness based on contemporary data between the surveillance strategies of the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) and British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG). DESIGN: We constructed a Markov decision model to simulate the clinical course of IBD patients. SETTING: We compared the 2 surveillance strategies for a base case of a 40-year-old colitis patient who was followed for 40 years. PATIENTS: AGA surveillance distinguishes 2 groups: a high-risk group with annual surveillance and an average-risk group with biannual surveillance. BSG surveillance distinguishes 3 risk groups with yearly, 3-year, or 5-year surveillance. INTERVENTIONS: Patients could move from a no-dysplasia state with colonoscopic surveillance to 1 of 3 states for which proctocolectomy was indicated: (1) dysplasia/local cancer, (2) regional/metastasized cancer, or (3) refractory disease. After proctocolectomy, a patient moved to a no-colon state without surveillance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Direct costs of medical care, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: BSG surveillance dominated AGA surveillance with $9846 per QALY. Both strategies were equally effective with 24.16 QALYs, but BSG surveillance was associated with lower costs because of fewer colonoscopies performed. Costs related to IBD, surgery, or cancer did not affect cost-effectiveness. LIMITATIONS: The model depends on the accuracy of derived data, and the assumptions that were made to reflect real-life situations. Study conclusions may only apply to the U.S. health care system.

13131,Cost-effectiveness of first-line treatments for patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Combinations of chemotherapy regimens and monoclonal antibodies have been demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mcrc). Although these combination treatment strategies are safe and effective in first-line treatment for mcrc, little is known about their economic consequences and resource allocation implications. In the present study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab plus folfiri, cetuximab plus folfiri, and panitumumab plus folfiri for patients with KRAS wild-type mcrc. METHODS: A Markov model simulated the lifetime patient outcomes and costs of each first-line treatment strategy and subsequent lines of treatment from the perspective of the health care payer in Ontario. The model was parameterized using data from the Ontario Cancer Registry, Ontario health administrative databases, and published randomized control trials. Patient outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (qalys), and costs were measured in monetary terms. Costs and outcomes were both discounted at 5% and expressed in 2012 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: For mcrc patients with KRAS wild-type disease, the treatment strategy of bevacizumab plus folfiri was found to dominate the other two first-line treatment strategies. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio values were sensitive to the effectiveness of treatment, the costs of bevacizumab and cetuximab, and health utility values. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from Ontario showed that bevacizumab plus folfiri is the cost-effective first-line treatment strategy for patients with KRAS wild-type mcrc.

Our objective is to compare costs and outcomes of plasma oxysterol screening versus current practice in diagnosis of NP-C disease among intellectually disabled (ID) patients using decision-analytic methods. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was conducted to follow ID patients through the diagnosis and treatment of NP-C, forecast the costs and effectiveness for a cohort of ID patients and compare the outcomes and costs in two different arms of the model: plasma oxysterol screening and routine diagnosis procedure (anno 2013) over 5 years of follow up. Data from published sources and clinical trials were used in simulation model. Unit costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at a 3% annual rate in the base case analysis. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The outcomes of the base case model showed that using plasma oxysterol screening for diagnosis of NP-C disease among ID patients is a dominant strategy. It would result in lower total cost and would slightly improve patients' quality of life. The average amount of cost saving was $3642 CAD and the incremental QALYs per each individual ID patient in oxysterol screening arm versus current practice of diagnosis NP-C was 0.0022 QALYs. Results of sensitivity analysis demonstrated robustness of the outcomes over the wide range of changes in model inputs. CONCLUSION: Whilst acknowledging the limitations of this study, we conclude that screening ID children and adolescents with oxysterol tests compared to current practice for the diagnosis of NP-C is a dominant strategy with clinical and economic benefits. The less costly, more sensitive and specific oxysterol test has potential to save costs to the healthcare system while improving patients' quality of life and may be considered as a routine tool in the NP-C diagnosis armamentarium for ID. Further research is needed to elucidate its effectiveness in patients presenting characteristics other than ID in childhood and adolescence.",2014-01-16151,25095726,Mol Genet Metab,Clara D M van Karnebeek,2015,114 / 2,,No,25095726,"Clara D M van Karnebeek; Tima Mohammadi; Nicole Tsao; Graham Sinclair; Sandra Sirrs; Sylvia Stockler; Carlo Marra; Health economic evaluation of plasma oxysterol screening in the diagnosis of Niemann-Pick Type C disease among intellectually disabled using discrete event simulation, Mol Genet Metab , 2015 Feb; 114(2):1096-7206",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Plasma oxysterol screening vs. Standard/Usual Care- Fibroblast filipin staining and cholesterol esterification studies or diagnosis and treatment of NP-C,Niemann-Pick Type C (NP-C) disease,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-566000,Canada,2012,-638173.11
13134,Cost-effectiveness analysis of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin in Clostridium difficile infection,"OBJECTIVES: Fidaxomicin was non-inferior to vancomycin with respect to clinical cure rates in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs) in two Phase III trials, but was associated with significantly fewer recurrences than vancomycin. This economic analysis investigated the cost-effectiveness of fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin in patients with severe CDI and in patients with their first CDI recurrence. METHODS: A 1 year time horizon Markov model with seven health states was developed from the perspective of Scottish public healthcare providers. Model inputs for effectiveness, resource use, direct costs and utilities were obtained from published sources and a Scottish expert panel. The main model outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), for fidaxomicin versus vancomycin; ICERs were interpreted using willingness-to-pay thresholds of pound20,000/QALY and pound30,000/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Total costs were similar with fidaxomicin and vancomycin in patients with severe CDI ( pound14,515 and pound14,344, respectively) and in patients with a first recurrence ( pound16,535 and pound16,926, respectively). Improvements in clinical outcomes with fidaxomicin resulted in small QALY gains versus vancomycin (severe CDI, +0.010; patients with first recurrence, +0.019). Fidaxomicin was cost-effective in severe CDI (ICER pound16,529/QALY) and dominant (i.e. more effective and less costly) in patients with a first recurrence. The probability that fidaxomicin was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30,000/QALY was 60% for severe CDI and 68% in a first recurrence.

13136,Cost-effectiveness of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in the treatment of elderly women and men with osteoporosis,"BACKGROUND: The supplementation with vitamin D and calcium has been recommended for elderly, specifically those with increased risk of fractures older than 65 years. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in elderly women and men with osteoporosis and therefore to assess if this recommendation is justified in terms of cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A validated model for economic evaluations in osteoporosis was used to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained of vitamin D/calcium supplementation compared with no treatment. The model was populated with cost and epidemiological data from a Belgian health-care perspective. Analyses were conducted in women and men with a diagnosis of osteoporosis (i.e. bone mineral density T-score </=-2.5). A literature search was conducted to describe the efficacy of vitamin D and calcium in terms of fracture risk reduction. RESULTS: The cost per QALY gained of vitamin D/calcium supplementation was estimated at euro40 578 and euro23 477 in women and men aged 60 years, respectively. These values decreased to euro7912 and euro10 250 at the age of 70 years and vitamin D and calcium supplementation was cost-saving at the age of 80 years, meaning that treatment cost was less than the costs of treating osteoporotic fractures of the no-treatment group.

13144,Hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement: a health economic analysis,"There has been a significant increase in use of hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement over the last 10 years. However, some care providers in the United Kingdom are not commissioning such an intervention due to cost constraints and lack of published cost effectiveness studies. A cost analysis for a prospective cohort of 58 patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement was performed. The short form 12 six dimension health utility score (SF12-6D) was used. This was recorded preoperatively and one year after surgery. Three time points (one, two, and 10 years) from operation were used to calculate the quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) gained. Predicted need for conversion to total hip replacement and diminishing gain with time (5% per year) was incorporated into the two- and 10-year models. The Scottish Tariff was used to assign the cost of surgery. The number of QALYs gained one year after surgery was 0.159, which equated to a cost per QALY of pound19,335. This cost decreased to pound10,118 per QALY gained at two years, and further still to pound2,677 per QALY gained at 10 years. Multivariable regression analysis found that a worse preoperative SF12-6D was an independent predictor of greater QALYs gained one year after surgery (R(2) = 0.51, p<0.001). At no point in time, from one year onwards, does hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement cost more than pound20,000 per QALY, making it a cost-effective intervention according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.",2014-01-16167,25044269,Hip Int,Nicholas D Clement,2014,24 / 5,457-64,No,25044269,"Nicholas D Clement; Deborah MacDonald; Paul Gaston; Hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement: a health economic analysis, Hip Int, ; 24(5):1724-6067; 457-64",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hip arthroscopy vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,64 Years,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,5.00,19335,United Kingdom,2012,34552.9
13145,Clinical- and cost-effectiveness of LDL particle-guided statin therapy: a simulation study,"We used the Archimedes Model, a mathematical simulation model (Model) to estimate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of using LDL particle concentration (LDL-P) as an adjunct or alternative to LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to guide statin therapy. LDL-P by NMR has been shown to be a better measure of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than LDL-C, and may therefore be a better gauge of the need for and response to statin treatment. Using the Model, we conducted a virtual clinical trial comparing the use of LDL-C alone, LDL-P alone, and LDL-C and LDL-P together to guide treatment in the general adult population, and in high-risk, dyslipidemic subpopulations.

For individuals with diabetes, the RRR was 7.3% (95% CI, 6.4-8.2; p < .0001) for LDL-P alone and 6.9% for dual markers (95% CI, 6.1-7.8; both, p < .0001). In the general population, the costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) associated with the use of LDL-P alone were $76,052 at 5 years and $8913 at 20 years and $142,825 at 5 years and $25,505 at 20 years with the use of both markers. In high-risk subpopulations, the use of LDL-P alone was cost-saving at 5 years; whereas the cost per QALY for the use of both markers was $14,250 at 5 years and $859 at 20 years for high-risk dyslipidemics, $19,192 at 5 years and $649 at 20 years for diabetics, and $9030 at 5 years and $7268 at 20 years for patients with prior CHD. In conclusion, the model estimates that using LDL-P to guide statin therapy may reduce the risk of CVD events to a greater extent than does the use of LDL-C alone and maybe cost-effective or cost-saving for high-risk patients.",2014-01-16173,25050538,Atherosclerosis,Henry J Folse,2014,236 / 1,154-61,No,25050538,"Henry J Folse; Devesh Goswami; Badri Rengarajan; Matthew Budoff; Richard Kahn; Clinical- and cost-effectiveness of LDL particle-guided statin therapy: a simulation study, Atherosclerosis, ; 236(1):1879-1484; 154-61",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"LDL particle number (LDL-P), determined directly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in order to guide statin therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to guide statin therapy",Not Stated,84 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 10, 20 years",3.00,3.00,142825,United States,2012,161000.21

13158,Economic evaluation of decompressive craniectomy versus barbiturate coma for refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury,"OBJECTIVES: Decompressive craniectomy and barbiturate coma are often used as second-tier strategies when intracranial hypertension following severe traumatic brain injury is refractory to first-line treatments. Uncertainty surrounds the decision to choose either treatment option. We investigated which strategy is more economically attractive in this context. DESIGN: We performed a cost-utility analysis. A Markov Monte Carlo microsimulation model with a life-long time horizon was created to compare quality-adjusted survival and cost of the two treatment strategies, from the perspective of healthcare payer. Model parameters were estimated from the literature. Two-dimensional simulation was used to incorporate parameter uncertainty into the model. Value of information analysis was conducted to identify major drivers of decision uncertainty and focus future research. SETTING: Trauma centers in the United States. SUBJECTS: Base case was a population of patients (mean age = 25 yr) who developed refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury. INTERVENTIONS: We compared two treatment strategies: decompressive craniectomy and barbiturate coma. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Decompressive craniectomy was associated with an average gain of 1.5 quality-adjusted life years relative to barbiturate coma, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $9,565/quality-adjusted life year gained. Decompressive craniectomy resulted in a greater quality-adjusted life expectancy 86% of the time and was more cost-effective than barbiturate coma in 78% of cases if our willingness-to-pay threshold is $50,000/quality-adjusted life year and 82% of cases at a threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year. At older age, decompressive craniectomy continued to increase survival but at higher cost (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio = $197,906/quality-adjusted life year at mean age = 85 yr). CONCLUSIONS: Based on available evidence, decompressive craniectomy for the treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury provides better value in terms of costs and health gains than barbiturate coma. However, decompressive craniectomy might be less economically attractive for older patients. Further research, particularly on natural history of severe traumatic brain injury patients, is needed to make more informed treatment decisions.",2014-01-16185,25054675,Crit Care Med,Aziz S Alali,2014,42 / 10,2235-43,No,25054675,"Aziz S Alali; David M J Naimark; Jefferson R Wilson; Robert A Fowler; Damon C Scales; Eyal Golan; Todd G Mainprize; Joel G Ray; Avery B Nathens; Economic evaluation of decompressive craniectomy versus barbiturate coma for refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury, Crit Care Med, ; 42(10):0090-3493; 2235-43",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Decompressive craniectomy vs. Barbiturate coma for the treatment of refractory intracranial hypertension following traumatic brain injury,Following traumatic brain injury,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,9565,United States,2013,10626.54
13159,MRI-guided focused ultrasound surgery for uterine fibroid treatment: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a treatment strategy for symptomatic uterine fibroids that uses MRI-guided focused ultrasound as a first-line therapy relative to uterine artery embolization (UAE) or hysterectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We developed a decision-analytic model to compare the cost effectiveness of three first-line treatment strategies: MRI-guided focused ultrasound, UAE, and hysterectomy. Treatment-specific short- and long-term utilities, lifetime costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were incorporated, allowing us to conduct an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, using a societal willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY to designate a strategy as cost effective. Sensitivity analyses were subsequently performed on all key parameters. RESULTS. In the base-case analysis, UAE as a first-line treatment of symptomatic fibroids was the most effective and expensive strategy (22.75 QALYs; $22,968), followed by MRI-guided focused ultrasound (22.73 QALYs; $20,252) and hysterectomy (22.54 QALYs; $11,253). MRI-guided focused ultrasound was cost effective relative to hysterectomy, with an associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $47,891/QALY. The ICER of UAE relative to MRI-guided focused ultrasound was $234,565/QALY, exceeding the WTP threshold of $50,000/QALY, therefore rendering MRI-guided focused ultrasound also cost effective relative to UAE. In sensitivity analyses, results were robust to changes in most parameters but were sensitive to changes in probabilities of recurrence, symptom relief, and quality-of-life measures. CONCLUSION. First-line treatment of eligible women with MRI-guided focused ultra-sound is a cost-effective noninvasive strategy. For those not eligible for MRI-guided focused ultra-sound, UAE remains a cost-effective option.

13161,Cost-effectiveness of asenapine in the treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder with mixed episodes in an Italian context,"INTRODUCTION: Bipolar disorder is a chronic disease characterized by periods of mania or hypomania, depression, or a combination of both (mixed state). Because bipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability, it represents an important economic burden on society. Asenapine (ASE) is a new second-generation antipsychotic developed and approved for the treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. The objective of the present study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ASE compared to olanzapine (OLA) in the treatment of patients experiencing mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in the context of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A pharmacoeconomic model was developed to simulate the management of Italian bipolar I patients with mixed episodes over a 5-year time horizon by combining clinical parameters with resource utilization. An expert panel of Italian psychiatrists and health economists was responsible for adapting a UK model to the Italian context. The primary outcome measure of the economic evaluation was the incremental cost effectiveness ratio, where effectiveness is measured in terms of quality adjusted life-years gained. Scenario analyses, sensitivity analyses, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: This pharmacoeconomic model showed that ASE resulted to be dominant over OLA; in fact, ASE was associated with lower direct costs (derived largely by the savings from hospitalizations avoided) and also generated a better quality of life. Results were robust to changes in key parameters; both scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses demonstrated model reliability. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study suggest that the management of bipolar I patients with mixed episodes using ASE as alternative to OLA can lead to cost saving for the Italian NHS and improve patients quality of life.",2014-01-16188,25055791,Adv Ther,Chiara Caresano,2014,31 / 8,873-90,No,25055791,"Chiara Caresano; Guido Di Sciascio; Andrea Fagiolini; Giuseppe Maina; Giulio Perugi; Claudio Ripellino; Claudio Vampini; Cost-effectiveness of asenapine in the treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder with mixed episodes in an Italian context, Adv Ther, ; 31(8):0741-238X; 873-90",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Asenapine vs. Olanzapine (OLA) strategy,experiencing mixed episodes,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,0.04,Not Stated,-43518.87,Euro,2012,-63080.95
13162,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of psychosocial intervention for early stage schizophrenia in China: a randomized, one-year study","BACKGROUND: A combination of psychosocial interventions and medications has been highly recommended as a successful treatment package for schizophrenia. Its cost-effectiveness has not been fully explored yet. The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of antipsychotics combined with psychosocial treatment and treatment as usual for patients with early-stage schizophrenia. METHOD: Patients with schizophrenia (N = 1, 268) were assigned to the combination of medication and psychosocial intervention or treatment as usual for up to 12 months. Cost analysis included direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs and indirect costs. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) ratings were assessed with Short- Form 6D. RESULTS: Average monthly psychosocial intervention costs for combined treatment were higher than treatment as usual (p = 0.005), but no significant differences were found in direct costs, indirect costs, and total costs between two groups (all p-values >/= 0.556). Combined treatment was associated with significant higher QALY ratings than treatment as usual (p = 0.039). Compared with treatment as usual, combined treatment resulted in a gain of 0.031 QALY ratings at an additional cost of US$ 56.4, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 1819.4 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Despite some limitations, our results supported that medication combined with psychosocial treatment was more cost-effective than treatment as usual for patients with early-stage schizophrenia.

AIM: To evaluate the long-term health economic outcomes of sofosbuvir + pegylated interferon alfa/ribavirin (pegIFN/RBV) compared with current treatments in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 in the US. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate health outcomes, number needed to treat and short-term and long-term economic outcomes, including incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost per sustained virological response (SVR), for several sofosbuvir-comparator regimen pairings for a cohort of 10 000 patients. It considered three patient cohorts: treatment-naive, treatment-experienced and treatment-naive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected. Subgroup analyses were conducted for treatment-naive patients with and without cirrhosis. RESULTS: Reductions in the incidence of new cases of liver-disease complications with sofosbuvir + pegIFN/RBV compared with pegIFN/RBV, boceprevir + pegIFN/RBV, telaprevir + pegIFN/RBV and simeprevir + pegIFN/RBV were 64-82%, 50-68%, 43-58% and 33-56%, respectively. Sofosbuvir + pegIFN/RBV was typically associated with the lowest 1-year cost per SVR. When considering the lifetime incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained, sofosbuvir + pegIFN/RBV was the most cost-effective treatment option assessed.

13182,A cost-effectiveness analysis of conservative versus surgical management for the initial treatment of stress urinary incontinence,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether conservative or surgical therapy is more cost effective for the initial treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). STUDY DESIGN: We created a decision tree model to compare costs and cost effectiveness of 3 strategies for the initial treatment of SUI: (1) continence pessary, (2) pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT), and (3) midurethral sling (MUS). We identified probabilities of SUI after 12 months of use of a pessary, PFMT, or MUS using published data. Parameter estimates included Health Utility Indices of no incontinence (.93) and persistent incontinence (0.7) after treatment. Morbidities associated with MUS included mesh erosion, retention, de novo urge incontinence, and recurrent SUI. Cost data were derived from Medicare in 2012 US dollars. One- and 2-way sensitivity analysis was used to examine the effect of varying rates of pursuing surgery if conservative management failed and rates of SUI cure with pessaries and PFMT. The primary outcome was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio threshold <$50,000. RESULTS: Compared to PFMT, initial treatment of SUI with MUS was the more cost-effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $32,132/quality-adjusted life year. Initial treatment with PFMT was also acceptable as long as subjective cure was >35%. In 3-way sensitivity analysis, subjective cure would need to be >40.5% for PFMT and 43.5% for a continence pessary for the MUS scenario to not be the preferred strategy. CONCLUSION: At 1 year, MUS is more cost effective than a continence pessary or PFMT for the initial treatment for SUI.",2014-01-16218,25019485,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Monica L Richardson,2014,211 / 5,565.e1-6,No,25019485,"Monica L Richardson; Eric R Sokol; A cost-effectiveness analysis of conservative versus surgical management for the initial treatment of stress urinary incontinence, Am J Obstet Gynecol, ; 211(5):0002-9378; 565.e1-6",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Midurethral sling (MUS) vs. Pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,32132,United States,2012,36220.96
13183,Cost-effectiveness of programs to eliminate disparities in elderly vaccination rates in the United States,"BACKGROUND: There are disparities in influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates among elderly minority groups and little guidance as to which intervention or combination of interventions to eliminate these disparities is likely to be most cost-effective. Here, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four hypothetical vaccination programs designed to eliminate disparities in elderly vaccination rates and differing in the number of interventions. METHODS: We developed a Markov model in which we assumed a healthcare system perspective, 10-year vaccination program and lifetime time horizon. The cohort was the combined African-American and Hispanic 65 year-old birth cohort in the United States in 2009. We evaluated five different vaccination strategies: no vaccination program and four vaccination programs that varied from ""low intensity"" to ""very high intensity"" based on the number of interventions deployed in each program, their cumulative cost and their cumulative impact on elderly minority influenza and pneumococcal vaccination rates. RESULTS: The very high intensity vaccination program ($24,479/quality-adjusted life year; QALY) was preferred at willingness-to-pay-thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY and prevented 37,178 influenza cases, 342 influenza deaths, 1,158 invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) cases and 174 IPD deaths over the birth cohort's lifetime.

13187,The cost-effectiveness of school-based eating disorder screening,"OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the value of school-based eating disorder (ED) screening for a hypothetical cohort of US public school students. METHODS: We used a decision-analytic microsimulation model to model the effectiveness (life-years with ED and quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), total direct costs, and cost-effectiveness (cost per QALY gained) of screening relative to current practice. RESULTS: The screening strategy cost $2260 (95% confidence interval [CI] = $1892, $2668) per student and resulted in a per capita gain of 0.25 fewer life-years with ED (95% CI = 0.21, 0.30) and 0.04 QALYs (95% CI = 0.03, 0.05) relative to current practice. The base case cost-effectiveness of the intervention was $9041 per life-year with ED avoided (95% CI = $6617, $12,344) and $56,500 per QALY gained (95% CI = $38,805, $71,250). CONCLUSIONS: At willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY gained, school-based ED screening is 41% and 100% likely to be cost-effective, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: To compare clinical- and cost-effectiveness of a range of MADs against no treatment in mild to moderate OSAHS. MEASUREMENTS AND METHODS: This open-label, randomised, controlled, crossover trial was undertaken at a UK sleep centre. Adults with Apnoea-Hypopnoea Index (AHI) 5-<30/h and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score >/=9 underwent 6 weeks of treatment with three non-adjustable MADs: self-moulded (SleepPro 1; SP1); semi-bespoke (SleepPro 2; SP2); fully-bespoke MAD (bMAD); and 4 weeks no treatment. Primary outcome was AHI scored by a polysomnographer blinded to treatment. Secondary outcomes included ESS, quality of life, resource use and cost. MAIN RESULTS: 90 patients were randomised and 83 were analysed. All devices reduced AHI compared with no treatment by 26% (95% CI 11% to 38%, p=0.001) for SP1, 33% (95% CI 24% to 41%) for SP2 and 36% (95% CI 24% to 45%, p<0.001) for bMAD. ESS was 1.51 (95% CI 0.73 to 2.29, p<0.001, SP1) to 2.37 (95% CI 1.53 to 3.22, p<0.001, bMAD) lower than no treatment (p<0.001 for all). Compliance was lower for SP1, which was the least preferred treatment at trial exit. All devices were cost-effective compared with no treatment at a pound20,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) threshold. SP2 was the most cost-effective up to pound39,800/QALY.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surveillance. DESIGN: We included 714 patients with long-segment BO in a multicentre prospective cohort study and used a multistate Markov model to calculate progression rates from no dysplasia (ND) to low-grade dysplasia (LGD), high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and OAC. Progression rates were incorporated in a decision-analytic model, including costs and quality of life data. We evaluated different surveillance intervals for ND and LGD, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and oesophagectomy for HGD or early OAC and oesophagectomy for advanced OAC. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated in costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: The annual progression rate was 2% for ND to LGD, 4% for LGD to HGD or early OAC and 25% for HGD or early OAC to advanced OAC. Surveillance every 5 or 4 years with RFA for HGD or early OAC and oesophagectomy for advanced OAC had ICERs of euro5.283 and euro62.619 per QALY for ND.

13197,Cost-effectiveness of training rural providers to identify and treat patients at risk for fragility fractures,"This is a cost-effectiveness analysis of training rural providers to identify and treat osteoporosis. Results showed a slight cost savings, increase in life years, increase in treatment rates, and decrease in fracture incidence. However, the results were sensitive to small differences in effectiveness, being cost-effective in 70 % of simulations during probabilistic sensitivity analysis. INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of training rural providers to identify and treat veterans at risk for fragility fractures relative to referring these patients to an urban medical center for specialist care. The model evaluated the impact of training on patient life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), treatment rates, fracture incidence, and costs from the perspective of the Department of Veterans Affairs. METHODS: We constructed a Markov microsimulation model to compare costs and outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of veterans seen by rural providers. Parameter estimates were derived from previously published studies, and we conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses on the parameter inputs. RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed that training resulted in no additional costs and an extra 0.083 life years (0.054 QALYs). Our model projected that as a result of training, more patients with osteoporosis would receive treatment (81.3 vs. 12.2 %), and all patients would have a lower incidence of fractures per 1,000 patient years (hip, 1.628 vs. 1.913; clinical vertebral, 0.566 vs. 1.037) when seen by a trained provider compared to an untrained provider. Results remained consistent in one-way sensitivity analysis and in probabilistic sensitivity analyses, training rural providers was cost-effective (less than $50,000/QALY) in 70 % of the simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Training rural providers to identify and treat veterans at risk for fragility fractures has a potential to be cost-effective, but the results are sensitive to small differences in effectiveness. It appears that provider education alone is not enough to make a significant difference in fragility fracture rates among veterans.",2014-01-16239,25037601,Osteoporos Int,S D Nelson,2014,25 / 12,2701-7,No,25037601,"S D Nelson; R E Nelson; G W Cannon; P Lawrence; M J Battistone; M Grotzke; Y Rosenblum; J LaFleur; Cost-effectiveness of training rural providers to identify and treat patients at risk for fragility fractures, Osteoporos Int, ; 25(12):0937-941X; 2701-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rural provider trained in miniresidency program for treating osteoporosis vs. Standard/Usual Care,veterans,70 Years,70 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-18.52,United States,2013,-20.57
13198,Cost-effectiveness analysis of early vs. late autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma,"BACKGROUND: Autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) is the current standard of care for most patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who are transplant eligible, yet the timing of ASCT is disputed due to a similar overall (OS) and progression-free survival with an early ASCT (eASCT) or a delayed ASCT (dASCT) approach. OBJECTIVE: We developed a decision analytic model to perform cost-effectiveness analysis of the two commonly used treatment strategies for MM. METHODS: Data on disease progression and treatment effectiveness came from 2001 to 2008 cohort treated at the Mayo Clinic and from published studies. Cost analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: The Consumer Price Index adjusted 2012 costs of eASCT and dASCT were $249 236 and $262 610, respectively. eASCT cohort had a benefit of 1.96 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), 0.23 QALYs more than dASCT, implying that eASCT is preferred (dominant) over dASCT. The most critical variables in one-way sensitivity analysis were treatment-related mortality and OS associated with eASCT strategy. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that eASCT could potentially be a relatively cost-effective treatment option for appropriate patients with MM, and these results would help patients, providers, and payers in decision making for timing of ASCT.",2014-01-16250,25040732,Clin Transplant,Chintan Pandya,2014,28 / 10,1084-91,No,25040732,"Chintan Pandya; Shahrukh Hashmi; Nandita Khera; Morie A Gertz; Angela Dispenzieri; William Hogan; Mustaqeem Siddiqui; Katia Noyes; Shaji K Kumar; Cost-effectiveness analysis of early vs. late autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma, Clin Transplant, ; 28(10):0902-0063; 1084-91",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early autologous stem cell transplant (eASCT) performed within 12 months of diagnosis vs. Delayed autologous stem cell transplant (dASCT),underwent a stem cell harvest attempt,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,4 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-58147.82,United States,2012,-65547.43
13199,Cost-effectiveness of noninvasive liver fibrosis tests for treatment decisions in patients with chronic hepatitis C,"The cost-effectiveness of noninvasive tests (NITs) as alternatives to liver biopsy is unknown. We compared the cost-effectiveness of using NITs to inform treatment decisions in adult patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to calculate the diagnostic accuracy of various NITs using a bivariate random-effects model. We constructed a probabilistic decision analytical model to estimate health care costs and outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years; QALYs) using data from the meta-analysis, literature, and national UK data. We compared the cost-effectiveness of four treatment strategies: testing with NITs and treating patients with fibrosis stage>/=F2; testing with liver biopsy and treating patients with >/=F2; treat none; and treat all irrespective of fibrosis. We compared all NITs and tested the cost-effectiveness using current triple therapy with boceprevir or telaprevir, but also modeled new, more-potent antivirals. Treating all patients without any previous NIT was the most effective strategy and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound9,204 per additional QALY gained. The exploratory analysis of currently licensed sofosbuvir treatment regimens found that treat all was cost-effective, compared to using an NIT to decide on treatment, with an ICER of pound16,028 per QALY gained. The exploratory analysis to assess the possible effect on results of new treatments, found that if SVR rates increased to >90% for genotypes 1-4, the incremental treatment cost threshold for the ""treat all"" strategy to remain the most cost-effective strategy would be pound37,500. Above this threshold, the most cost-effective option would be noninvasive testing with magnetic resonance elastography (ICER= pound9,189).
