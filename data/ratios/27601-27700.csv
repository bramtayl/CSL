27601,Cost-effectiveness of mandatory folate fortification v. other options for the prevention of neural tube defects: results from Australia and New Zealand,"OBJECTIVE: To provide input to Australian and New Zealand government decision making regarding an optimal strategy to reduce the rate of neural tube defects (NTD). DESIGN: Standard comparative health economic evaluation techniques were employed for a set of intervention options for promoting folate/folic acid consumption in women capable of or planning a pregnancy. Evidence of effectiveness was informed by the international literature and costs were derived for Australia and New Zealand. RESULTS: Population-wide campaigns to promote supplement use and mandatory fortification were the most effective at reducing NTD, at an estimated 36 and 31 fewer cases per annum respectively for Australia and New Zealand, representing an 8 % reduction in the current annual NTD rate. Population-wide and targeted approaches to increase supplement use were cost-effective, at less than $AU 12 500 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted ($US 9893, pound5074), as was extending voluntary fortification. Mandatory fortification was not cost-effective for New Zealand at $AU 138 500 per DALY ($US 109 609, pound56 216), with results uncertain for Australia, given widely varying cost estimates. Promoting a folate-rich diet was least cost-effective, with benefits restricted to impact on NTD. CONCLUSIONS: Several options for reducing NTD appear to fall well within accepted societal cost-effectiveness norms. All estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, exacerbated by possible interactions between interventions, including impacts on currently effective strategies.

27614,Cost-effectiveness of mandatory folate fortification v. other options for the prevention of neural tube defects: results from Australia and New Zealand,"OBJECTIVE: To provide input to Australian and New Zealand government decision making regarding an optimal strategy to reduce the rate of neural tube defects (NTD). DESIGN: Standard comparative health economic evaluation techniques were employed for a set of intervention options for promoting folate/folic acid consumption in women capable of or planning a pregnancy. Evidence of effectiveness was informed by the international literature and costs were derived for Australia and New Zealand. RESULTS: Population-wide campaigns to promote supplement use and mandatory fortification were the most effective at reducing NTD, at an estimated 36 and 31 fewer cases per annum respectively for Australia and New Zealand, representing an 8 % reduction in the current annual NTD rate. Population-wide and targeted approaches to increase supplement use were cost-effective, at less than $AU 12 500 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted ($US 9893, pound5074), as was extending voluntary fortification. Mandatory fortification was not cost-effective for New Zealand at $AU 138 500 per DALY ($US 109 609, pound56 216), with results uncertain for Australia, given widely varying cost estimates. Promoting a folate-rich diet was least cost-effective, with benefits restricted to impact on NTD.

27616,Congenital Syphilis: An Economic Evaluation of a Prevention Program in China,"BACKGROUND:: Until now there has been no data to show the effectiveness or benefits of screening for syphilis in gravidas in China. This study was to assess the effectiveness of a program preventing mother-to-child-transmission of syphilis and to reveal factors impacting the benefit. METHODS:: A cohort of 159,017 gravidas were screened for syphilis by serologic methods and infected individuals were treated with 3 injections of 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin in Shenzhen in 2005. The pregnancy outcomes were compared for this cost-effectiveness analysis in 2 scenarios, intervention with screening and treatment versus no intervention. RESULTS:: Eight hundred twenty-seven pregnant women (0.52%) were diagnosed with syphilis and treated subsequently. Of these, 200 gestations ended in miscarriage. Four babies were diagnosed with congenital syphilis; 25 neonates with low birth weight; 1 died after birth. The total cost was $636,748. On average, every $770 identified 1 infected mother. Every $4391 prevented 1 congenital syphilis; every $5135 prevented 1 low birth weight; and every $7075 prevented 1 death. One disability adjusted life year could be saved by $215. In total the program reached a benefit to cost ratio of 21.76. Sensitivity analyses revealed that this ratio was mainly impacted by the prevalence of syphilis in pregnant women and the rate of miscarriage. CONCLUSIONS:: Screening for antenatal syphilis combined with intervening during gestation is highly effective in China. Reducing the percentage of spontaneous/induced abortion would be one of the most effective methods of further increasing the benefits of this screening.",2009-XX-05455,19734825,Sex Transm Dis,Fu-Chang Hong,2009,/,,No,19734825,"Fu-Chang Hong; Jiang-Bo Liu; Tie-Jian Feng; Xiao-Li Liu; Peng Pan; Hua Zhou; Yu-Mao Cai; Li Ling; Xi-Ming Huang; Dan Zhang; Ying-Ji Zhang; Maurice Zeegers; Congenital Syphilis: An Economic Evaluation of a Prevention Program in China, Sex Transm Dis, 2009-Sep-03; ():0148-5717",DALY,China,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Screening",Congenital syphilis screening vs. None,Pregnant,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,3.00,215,United States,2005,284.92

27668,Cost-effectiveness of improving pediatric hospital care in Nicaragua,"To determine the costs and cost-effectiveness of an intervention to improve quality of care for children with diarrhea or pneumonia in 14 hospitals in Nicaragua, based on expenditure data and impact measures.Hospital length of stay (LOS) and deaths were abstracted from a random sample of 1294 clinical records completed at seven of the 14 participating hospitals before the intervention (2003) and 1505 records completed after two years of intervention implementation (""post-intervention""; 2006). Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were derived from outcome data. Hospitalization costs were calculated based on hospital and Ministry of Health records and private sector data. Intervention costs came from project accounting records. Decision-tree analysis was used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness.Average LOS decreased from 3.87 and 4.23 days pre-intervention to 3.55 and 3.94 days post-intervention for diarrhea (P = 0.078) and pneumonia (P = 0.055), respectively. Case fatalities decreased from 45/10 000 and 34/10 000 pre-intervention to 30/10 000 and 27/10 000 post-intervention for diarrhea (P = 0.062) and pneumonia (P = 0.37), respectively. Average total hospitalization and antibiotic costs for both diagnoses were US$ 451 (95% credibility interval [CI]: US$ 419-US$ 482) pre-intervention and US$ 437 (95% CI: US$ 402-US$ 464) post-intervention. The intervention was cost-saving in terms of DALYs (95% CI: -US$ 522- US$ 32 per DALY averted) and cost US$ 21 per hospital day averted (95% CI: -US$ 45- US$ 204).After two years of intervention implementation, LOS and deaths for diarrhea decreased, along with LOS for pneumonia, with no increase in hospitalization costs. If these changes were entirely attributable to the intervention, it would be cost-saving.",2012-99-08527,22262272,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Edward I Broughton,2011,30 /,453-60,No,22262272,"Edward I Broughton; Ivonne Gomez; Oscar Nu?ez; Yudy Wong; Cost-effectiveness of improving pediatric hospital care in Nicaragua, Rev Panam Salud Publica, ; 30 ():1020-4989; 453-60",DALY,Nicaragua,Not Stated,Care Delivery,"Quality Intervention (QI) to improve pediatric hospital care, specifically for diarrhea and pneumonia vs. Standard/Usual Care",Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,-233.33,United States,2010,-276.94
27669,Cost-effectiveness of the introduction of a pre-erythrocytic malaria vaccine into the expanded program on immunization in sub-Saharan Africa: analysis of uncertainties using a stochastic individual-based simulation model of Plasmodium falciparum malaria,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing the RTS,S malaria vaccine into the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the contributions of different sources of uncertainty, and the associated expected value of perfect information (EVPI).Vaccination was simulated in populations of 100,000 people at 10 different entomological inoculation rates (EIRs), using an existing stochastic model and a 10-year time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and EVPI were computed from weighted averages of outputs using two different assignments of the EIR distribution in 2007. Uncertainty was evaluated by resampling of epidemiological, vaccination, and health systems model parameters.Health benefits were predicted consistently only at low transmission, and program costs always substantially exceeded case management savings. Optimal cost-effectiveness was at EIR of about 10 infectious bites per annum (ibpa). Main contributors to ICER uncertainty were uncertainty in transmission intensity, price per vaccine dose, decay rate of the vaccine effect, degree of homogeneity in host response, and some epidemiological model parameters. Other health system costs were unimportant. With a ceiling ratio of 207 international dollars per disability-adjusted life-year averted, 52.4% of parameterizations predicted cost-effectiveness in the primary analysis.Cost-effectiveness of RTS,S will be maximal in low endemicity settings (EIR 2-20 ibpa). Widespread deployment of other transmission-reducing interventions will thus improve cost-effectiveness, suggesting a selective introduction strategy. EVPI is substantial.

27670,Development of a model to assess the cost-effectiveness of gestational diabetes mellitus screening and lifestyle change for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasingly recognized as an opportunity for early prevention of diabetes and other diseases over the lifespan, and may be responsible for up to 30% of cases of type 2 diabetes. A newly developed mathematical model (the GDModel) provides provisional estimates of the cost and health impact of various GDM screening and management choices, and calculates averted disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). The model was piloted in 5 different healthcare facilities in India and Israel. Universal screening of pregnant women followed by postpartum lifestyle management yielded net savings of US$78 per woman with GDM in India and US$1945 per woman in Israel. The estimated DALYs averted were 2.33 in India and 3.10 in Israel. With lower GDM prevalence, intervention efficacy, and type 2 diabetes incidence, the intervention had a net cost in India, with a cost per DALY averted of US$11.32. This was far below the WHO definition of ""very cost-effective,"" set at annual GDP per capita. The intervention in Israel remained cost-saving. GDM screening and postpartum lifestyle management are either cost-saving or have a net cost but an attractive cost-effectiveness ratio. Some input values are currently being refined.

27700,Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis with the Xpert MTB/RIF assay in high burden countries: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is a promising new rapid diagnostic technology for tuberculosis (TB) that has characteristics that suggest large-scale roll-out. However, because the test is expensive, there are concerns among TB program managers and policy makers regarding its affordability for low- and middle-income settings.We estimate the impact of the introduction of Xpert on the costs and cost-effectiveness of TB care using decision analytic modelling, comparing the introduction of Xpert to a base case of smear microscopy and clinical diagnosis in India, South Africa, and Uganda. The introduction of Xpert increases TB case finding in all three settings; from 72%-85% to 95%-99% of the cohort of individuals with suspected TB, compared to the base case. Diagnostic costs (including the costs of testing all individuals with suspected TB) also increase: from US$28-US$49 to US$133-US$146 and US$137-US$151 per TB case detected when Xpert is used ""in addition to"" and ""as a replacement of"" smear microscopy, respectively.
