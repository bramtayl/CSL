23801,Is Reconstruction of Unstable Midfoot Charcot Neuroarthropathy Cost Effective from a US Payer's Perspective?,"BACKGROUND: Charcot neuroarthropathy is a morbid and expensive complication of diabetes that can lead to lower extremity amputation. Current treatment of unstable midfoot deformity includes lifetime limb bracing, primary transtibial amputation, or surgical reconstruction of the deformity. In the absence of a widely adopted treatment algorithm, the decision to pursue more costly attempts at reconstruction in the United States continues to be driven by surgeon preference. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: To examine the cost effectiveness (defined by lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) of surgical reconstruction and its alternatives (primary transtibial amputation and lifetime bracing) for adults with diabetes and unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy using previously published cost data. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare Charcot reconstruction and its alternatives in three progressively worsening clinical scenarios: no foot ulcer, uncomplicated (or uninfected) ulcer, and infected ulcer. Our base case scenario was a 50-year-old adult with diabetes and unstable midfoot deformity. Patients were placed into health states based on their disease stage. Transitions between health states occurred annually using probabilities estimated from the evidence obtained after systematic review. The time horizon was 50 cycles. Data regarding costs were obtained from a systematic review. Costs were converted to 2019 USD using the Consumer Price Index. The primary outcomes included the long-term costs and QALYs, which were combined to form ICERs. Willingness-to-pay was set at USD 100,000/QALY. Multiple sensitivity analyses and probabilistic analyses were performed to measure model uncertainty. RESULTS: The most effective strategy for patients without foot ulcers was Charcot reconstruction, which resulted in an additional 1.63 QALYs gained and an ICER of USD 14,340 per QALY gained compared with lifetime bracing. Reconstruction was also the most effective strategy for patients with uninfected foot ulcers, resulting in an additional 1.04 QALYs gained, and an ICER of USD 26,220 per QALY gained compared with bracing. On the other hand, bracing was cost effective in all scenarios and was the only cost-effective strategy for patents with infected foot ulcers; it resulted in 6.32 QALYs gained and an ICER of USD 15,010 per QALY gained compared with transtibial amputation. As unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy progressed to deep infection, reconstruction lost its value (ICER USD 193,240 per QALY gained) compared with bracing. This was driven by the increasing costs associated with staged surgeries, combined with a higher frequency of complications and shorter patient life expectancies in the infected ulcer cohort. The findings in the no ulcer and uncomplicated ulcer cohorts were both unchanged after multiple sensitivity analyses; however, threshold effects were identified in the infected ulcer cohort during the sensitivity analysis. When the cost of surgery dropped below USD 40,000 or the frequency of postoperative complications dropped below 50%, surgical reconstruction became cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons aiming to offer both clinically effective and cost-effective care would do well to discuss surgical reconstruction early with patients who have unstable midfoot Charcot neuroarthropathy, and they should favor lifetime bracing only after deep infection develops. Future clinical studies should focus on methods of minimizing surgical complications and/or reducing operative costs in patients with infected foot ulcers.

23804,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Non-risk-adapted Active Surveillance for Postorchiectomy Management of Clinical Stage I Seminoma,"BACKGROUND: Cancer-specific survival for men with clinical stage I (CSI) seminoma approaches 100%, regardless of the management approach chosen after orchiectomy. Given the young age and high survival rate of these patients, there has been a shift toward minimizing treatment-related morbidity and cost. In this context, non-risk-adapted active surveillance (NRAS) has emerged as a desirable management strategy. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical, quality of life, and economic values of postorchiectomy NRAS for CSI seminoma. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a decision analytic Markov model to estimate the costs and health outcomes of competing postorchiectomy management strategies for otherwise healthy 30-yr-old men with CSI seminoma. INTERVENTION: Real-world current practice, comprising active surveillance and adjuvant therapies (reference arm), was compared with empiric adjuvant radiotherapy (option 1), empiric adjuvant chemotherapy (option 2), risk-adapted active surveillance (RAAS; option 3), and NRAS (option 4). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), medical costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, mortality, and unnecessary treatment avoidance were estimated over a 10-yr period. Uncertainties in model input values were accounted for using univariate, scenario, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: NRAS dominated all other management options, offering the lowest per-patient health care cost ($3839) and the highest QALYs gained (7.74) over 10 yr. On probabilistic sensitivity analysis, NRAS had the highest chance of being most cost effective. Although NRAS resulted in the highest rate of salvage chemotherapy (20% vs 6% radiotherapy, 6% chemotherapy, 15% current practice, and 16% RAAS), it had the same mortality rate compared to current practice (2.5%). NRAS also allowed 80% of patients to avoid unnecessary treatment compared with 46% for current practice and 52% for RAAS. Study limitations included model simplifications, model parameter assumptions, as well as the absence of patient preference as a decision factor. CONCLUSIONS: NRAS maintains high cure rates for CSI seminoma, minimizes unnecessary treatment, and is cost effective compared with other management strategies. PATIENT SUMMARY: Clinical stage I (CSI) seminoma is one of the most common forms of testicular cancer. Surgery is the first step in the treatment of men with this disease, and some men may receive additional treatment with radiation or chemotherapy afterward. As most men are cured with surgery alone, non-risk-adapted active surveillance (NRAS), which involves routine monitoring with imaging and blood tests for disease recurrence after surgery, has become a desirable treatment option. Our study shows that in addition to maintaining high survival rates and avoiding unnecessary radiation and chemotherapy, NRAS is cost effective for the health care system.

23808,Isolated Echogenic Intracardiac Foci and the Role of Cell-Free Fetal DNA: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Cell-free fetal DNA (cfDNA) has been increasingly incorporated into prenatal aneuploidy screening paradigms given its relatively high sensitivity for Down syndrome (DS). This is often the case when fetal ultrasonographic soft markers are present, such as the relatively common echogenic intracardiac foci (EIF). We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a screening strategy that included cfDNA screening when an isolated EIF is identified in a low risk population with prior aneuploidy screening. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed using TreeAge software with probabilities derived from the literature. Our model compared cfDNA screening following isolated EIF detection in women less than 35 years with prior reassuring first trimester screen compared to a strategy of no further aneuploidy screening. Strategies were compared to generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with a threshold of $100 000/QALY and applied to a theoretical cohort. RESULTS: The cfDNA strategy resulted in 21 fewer DS births and 52 additional QALYS, however increased costs by $51.3 million. This yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $986 503; therefore, it was not a cost effective strategy. CONCLUSION: In a low risk population with prior reassuring aneuploidy screening, it is not cost effective to offer cfDNA after identification of an isolated EIF.

23809,The cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin compared to DPP-4 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Netherlands,"AIM: When glycaemic control for people with type 2 diabetes is not achieved with metformin and sulfonylurea alone, adding another oral anti-diabetes drug, such as a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) or dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, is an alternative to starting insulin. The aim of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin (an SGLT2 inhibitor) compared with DPP-4 inhibitor when added to metformin and sulfonylurea in people with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis is performed using the Cardiff diabetes model, a fixed-time increment stochastic simulation model informed by ''United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 68'' risk equations. The base-case analysis uses a 40-year time horizon, a Dutch societal perspective and differential discounting (4% for costs, 1.5% for effects). Inputs are obtained from the literature and Dutch price lists. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis are performed. RESULTS: Dapagliflozin is dominant compared with DPP-4 inhibitors, resulting in a 990 cost saving and a 0.28 quality-adjusted life year gain over 40 years. Cost savings are associated mainly with treatment costs and a reduced incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications, among others nephropathy, myocardial infarction and stroke. Results are robust to changes in input parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin is a cost-saving alternative to DPP-4 inhibitor when added to metformin and sulfonylurea. The incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications is lower for people treated with dapagliflozin. Uncertainty around this outcome is low. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

23810,Cost-Effectiveness of Drug Treatment for Chinese Patients With Stage I Hypertension According to the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines,"Systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg has been defined as stage I hypertension by the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines. Drug treatment is recommended for stage I hypertensive patients aged >=65 years without cardiovascular disease in the 2017 Hypertension Clinical Practice Guidelines but not in the 2018 Chinese guidelines. However, the cost-effectiveness of drug treatment among this subgroup of Chinese patients is unclear. This study developed a microsimulation model to compare costs and effectiveness of drug treatment and nondrug treatment for the subgroup of stage I hypertensive patients over a lifetime horizon from a government affordability perspective. Event rates of mortality and cardiovascular complications were estimated from 3 cohorts in the Chinese population. Costs and health utilities were obtained from the national statistics report and published literature. The model predicted that drug treatment generated quality-adjusted life-years of 13.52 and associated with expected costs of $6825 in comparison with 13.81 and $7328 produced by nondrug treatment over a lifetime horizon among stage I hypertensive patients aged >=65 years without cardiovascular disease. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $8836/quality-adjusted lifeyear (the GDP per capita in 2017), drug treatment only had a 1.8% probability of being cost-effective compared with nondrug treatment after 10 000 probabilistic simulations.

23811,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of SGLT2i in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a comprehensive economic evaluation using clinical trial and real-world evidence,"AIMS: The economic burden of diabetes is driven by the management of vascular complications. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular and renal complications, including hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF) and renal disease progression, in randomised clinical trials. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the SGLT2i class versus standard of care in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using evidence from both clinical trial and real-world studies. METHODS: An established T2DM model was adapted to use contemporary outcomes evidence from real-world studies and randomised controlled trial evaluations of SGLT2i and extrapolated over a lifetime for HHF, myocardial infarction, stroke, end-stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. The economic analysis considered adults with T2DM, with and without established cardiovascular disease, and was conducted over a lifetime from the perspective of the healthcare payer in the UK, US, and China, discounted at country-specific rates. RESULTS: SGLT2i were consistently associated with increased treatment costs, reduced complication costs and gains in quality-adjusted life years driven by differences in projected life expectancy, cardiovascular and microvascular morbidity and weight loss. SGLT2i were estimated to be cost-saving or cost-effective at relevant thresholds for the overall population in the UK, US and China, with the cost-effectiveness being greatest in higher risk subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the need to take into account cost savings from reducing common, morbid and preventable T2DM complications when considering the cost of diabetes medications.

RESULTS: SGLT2i were consistently associated with increased treatment costs, reduced complication costs and gains in quality-adjusted life years driven by differences in projected life expectancy, cardiovascular and microvascular morbidity and weight loss. SGLT2i were estimated to be cost-saving or cost-effective at relevant thresholds for the overall population in the UK, US and China, with the cost-effectiveness being greatest in higher risk subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the need to take into account cost savings from reducing common, morbid and preventable T2DM complications when considering the cost of diabetes medications.

We estimate the long-term health and economic implications of implementing LCIs in state Medicaid programs. METHODS: We compared LCIs modeled after the intervention of the Diabetes Prevention Program versus routine care advice using a decision analytic simulation model and best available data from representative surveys, cohort studies, Medicaid claims data, and the published literature. Target population were non-disability-based adult Medicaid beneficiaries aged 19-64 years at high risk for type 2 diabetes (BMI >=25 kg/m2 and HbA1c >= 5.7% or fasting plasma glucose >= 110 mg/dl) from eight study states (Alabama, California, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma) that represent around 50% of the US Medicaid population. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) measured in cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and population cost and health impact were modeled from a healthcare system perspective and a narrow Medicaid perspective. RESULTS: In the eight selected study states, 1.9 million or 18% of non-disability-based adult Medicaid beneficiaries would belong to the eligible high-risk target population - 66% of them Hispanics or non-Hispanic black. In the base-case analysis, the aggregated 5- and 10-year ICERs are US$226 k/QALY and US$34 k/QALY; over 25 years, the intervention dominates routine care. The 5-, 10-, and 25-year probabilities that the ICERs are below US$50 k (US$100 k)/QALY are 6% (15%), 59% (82%) and 96% (100%). From a healthcare system perspective, initial program investments of US$800 per person would be offset after 13 years and translate to US$548 of savings after 25 years. With a 20% LCI uptake in eligible beneficiaries, this would translate to upfront costs of US$300 million, prevent 260 thousand years of diabetes and save US$205 million over a 25-year time horizon. Cost savings from a narrow Medicaid perspective would be much smaller. Minorities and low-income groups would over-proportionally benefit from LCIs in Medicaid, but the impact on population health and health equity would be marginal.

METHODS: We developed a Markov decision model to determine the cost-effectiveness of guideline-based management for asymptomatic pancreatic cysts. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and survival were calculated for current management guidelines. A sensitivity analysis estimated the effect on cost-effectiveness and mortality if overtreatment of low-grade cysts is avoided, and the sensitivity and specificity thresholds required of methods of cyst stratification to improve costs expended. RESULTS: ""Surveillance"" using current management guidelines had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $171,143/quality adjusted life year compared with no surveillance or operative treatment (""do nothing""). An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for surveillance decreases to $80,707/quality adjusted life year if the operative overtreatment of low-grade cysts was avoided. Assuming a societal willingness-to-pay of $100,000/quality adjusted life year, the diagnostic specificity for high-risk cysts must be >67% for surveillance to be preferred over surgery and ""do nothing."" Changes in sensitivity alone cannot make surveillance cost-effective. Most importantly, survival in surveillance is worse than ""do nothing"" for 3 years after cyst diagnosis, although long-term survival is improved. The disadvantage is eliminated when overtreatment of low-grade cysts is avoided.

23834,Costs and cost-effectiveness of the Patient-centered HIV Care Model: A collaboration between community-based pharmacists and primary medical providers,"BACKGROUND: The Patient-centered HIV Care Model (PCHCM) is an evidence-informed structural intervention that integrates community-based pharmacists with primary medical providers to improve rates of HIV viral suppression. This report assesses the costs and cost-effectiveness of the PCHCM. SETTING: Patient-centered HIV Care Model METHODS: : Three project sites, each composed of a medical clinic and one or two community-based HIV-specialized pharmacies, were included in the analyses. PCHCM required patient data sharing between medical providers and pharmacists and collaborative therapy-related decision making. Intervention effectiveness was measured as the incremental number of patients virally suppressed (HIV RNA <200 copies/mL at the last test in a 12-month measurement period). Micro-costing direct measurement methods were used to estimate intervention. The cost per patient, cost per patient visit, and incremental cost per patient virally suppressed were calculated from the health care providers'' perspective. Additionally, the number of HIV transmissions averted, lifetime HIV treatment cost saved, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, and cost per QALY saved were calculated from the societal perspective, using standard methods and reported values from the published literature. RESULTS: Overall, the PCHCM annual intervention cost for the three project sites was $226,741. The average cost per patient, cost per patient visit, and incremental cost per patient virally suppressed were $813, $48, and $5,039, respectively. The intervention averted 2.75 HIV transmissions and saved 12.22 QALYs and nearly $1.28 million in lifetime HIV treatment costs. The intervention was cost saving overall and at each project site. CONCLUSIONS: The PCHCM can be delivered at a relatively low cost and is a cost-saving intervention to assist patients in achieving viral suppression and preventing HIV transmission.",2020-01-33491,0,Front.

23835,Costs and cost-effectiveness of the Patient-centered HIV Care Model: A collaboration between community-based pharmacists and primary medical providers,"BACKGROUND: The Patient-centered HIV Care Model (PCHCM) is an evidence-informed structural intervention that integrates community-based pharmacists with primary medical providers to improve rates of HIV viral suppression. This report assesses the costs and cost-effectiveness of the PCHCM. SETTING: Patient-centered HIV Care Model METHODS: : Three project sites, each composed of a medical clinic and one or two community-based HIV-specialized pharmacies, were included in the analyses. PCHCM required patient data sharing between medical providers and pharmacists and collaborative therapy-related decision making. Intervention effectiveness was measured as the incremental number of patients virally suppressed (HIV RNA <200 copies/mL at the last test in a 12-month measurement period). Micro-costing direct measurement methods were used to estimate intervention. The cost per patient, cost per patient visit, and incremental cost per patient virally suppressed were calculated from the health care providers'' perspective. Additionally, the number of HIV transmissions averted, lifetime HIV treatment cost saved, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, and cost per QALY saved were calculated from the societal perspective, using standard methods and reported values from the published literature. RESULTS: Overall, the PCHCM annual intervention cost for the three project sites was $226,741. The average cost per patient, cost per patient visit, and incremental cost per patient virally suppressed were $813, $48, and $5,039, respectively. The intervention averted 2.75 HIV transmissions and saved 12.22 QALYs and nearly $1.28 million in lifetime HIV treatment costs. The intervention was cost saving overall and at each project site. CONCLUSIONS: The PCHCM can be delivered at a relatively low cost and is a cost-saving intervention to assist patients in achieving viral suppression and preventing HIV transmission.",2020-01-33491,0,Front.

23838,Cost-effectiveness analysis of MR-guided focused ultrasound thalamotomy for tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease,"OBJECTIVE: The development of transcranial MR-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) has revitalized the practice of lesioning procedures in functional neurosurgery. Previous health economic analysis found MRgFUS thalamotomy to be a cost-effective treatment for patients with essential tremor, supporting its reimbursement. With the publication of level I evidence in support of MRgFUS thalamotomy for patients with tremor-dominant Parkinson''s disease (TDPD), the authors performed a health economic comparison between MRgFUS, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and medical therapy. METHODS: The authors used a decision tree model with rollback analysis and one-factor sensitivity analysis. Literature searches of MRgFUS thalamotomy and unilateral DBS of the ventrointermediate nucleus of the thalamus for TDPD were performed to determine the utility and probabilities for the model. Costs in Canadian dollars (CAD) were derived from the Schedule of Benefits and Fees in Ontario, Canada, and expert opinion on usage. RESULTS: MRgFUS was associated with an expected cost of $14,831 CAD. Adding MRgFUS to continued medical therapy resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $30,078 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), which remained cost-effective under various scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. Comparing DBS to MRgFUS, while DBS did not achieve the willingness-to-pay threshold ($56,503 per QALY) in the base case scenario, it did so under several scenarios in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: MRgFUS thalamotomy is a cost-effective treatment for patients with TDPD, particularly over continued medical therapy. While MRgFUS remains competitive with DBS, the cost-effectiveness advantage is less substantial.

23840,Cost-effectiveness of an intervention to improve the quality of nursing care among immobile patients with stroke in China: A multicenter study,"BACKGROUND: While a nursing intervention program for immobile patients with stroke can improve clinic outcomes, less is known about the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention program for immobile patients with stroke in China. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pre-test/post-test (before and after) study was undertaken from a health care perspective. SETTINGS: Participants were recruited from 25 hospitals among six provinces or municipal cities in eastern (Guangdong province, Zhejiang province, and Beijing municipal city), western (Sichuan province), and central (Henan province and Hubei province) China. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 7,653 immobile stroke patients were included in our sample. Patients in routine care settings were recruited from November 2015 to June 2016, and the recruitment of the intervention group patients was from November 2016 to July 2017. METHODS: To adjust for potential bias from confounding variables, the 1:1 propensity score matching yielded matched pairs of 2,966 patients in the routine care group and 2,966 patients in the intervention group, with no significant differences in sociodemographic or clinical characteristics between two groups. All patients were followed-up 3 months after enrolment in the study. Total healthcare costs were extracted from the hospital information system, with the health outcome effectiveness of the intervention program measured using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) instrument and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with a time horizon of 3 months. RESULTS: Compared to routine care, the intervention program decreased the total costs of stroke patients by CN4,600 (95% confidence interval [CI]: [-7050, -2151]), while increasing quality-adjusted life year 0.009 (95% CI: [0.005, 0.013]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over 3 months was CN-517,011 per quality-adjusted life year (95% CI: [-1,111,442, -203,912]). Subgroup analysis reveals that both the health-related quality of life and cost effectiveness improved significantly for ischemic patients and tertiary hospitals patients while for hemorrhagic patients and non-tertiary hospital patients only the health-related quality of life improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this first cost-effectiveness analysis in immobile stroke patients provide evidence that an intervention program provided significant cost saving, but mainly in ischemic patients and tertiary hospital patients. Wider adoption of such programs may be a sensible approach to reducing the burden of stroke and for immobile patients more generally. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

23841,Hepatitis C Management at Federally Qualified Health Centers during the Opioid Epidemic: A Cost-Effectiveness Study,"BACKGROUND: The opioid epidemic has been associated with an increase in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) have a high burden of hepatitis C disease and could serve as venues to enhance testing and treatment. METHODS: We estimated clinical outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C testing and treatment at US FQHCs using individual-based simulation modeling. We used individual-level data from 57 FQHCs to model 9 strategies, including permutations of HCV antibody testing modality, person initiating testing, and testing approach. Outcomes included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), hepatitis C cases identified, treated and cured; and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Compared with current practice (risk-based with laboratory-based testing), routine rapid point-of-care testing initiated and performed by a counselor identified 68% more cases after (nonreflex) RNA testing in the first month of the intervention and led to a 17% reduction in cirrhosis cases and a 22% reduction in liver deaths among those with cirrhosis over a lifetime. Routine rapid testing initiated by a counselor or a clinician provided better outcomes at either lower total cost or at lower cost per QALY gained, when compared with all other strategies. Findings were most influenced by the proportion of patients informed of their anti-HCV test results. CONCLUSIONS: Routine anti-HCV testing followed by prompt RNA testing for positives is recommended at FQHCs to identify infections. If using dedicated staff or point-of-care testing is not feasible, then measures to improve immediate patient knowledge of antibody status should be considered. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

RESULTS: Compared with current practice (risk-based with laboratory-based testing), routine rapid point-of-care testing initiated and performed by a counselor identified 68% more cases after (nonreflex) RNA testing in the first month of the intervention and led to a 17% reduction in cirrhosis cases and a 22% reduction in liver deaths among those with cirrhosis over a lifetime. Routine rapid testing initiated by a counselor or a clinician provided better outcomes at either lower total cost or at lower cost per QALY gained, when compared with all other strategies. Findings were most influenced by the proportion of patients informed of their anti-HCV test results. CONCLUSIONS: Routine anti-HCV testing followed by prompt RNA testing for positives is recommended at FQHCs to identify infections. If using dedicated staff or point-of-care testing is not feasible, then measures to improve immediate patient knowledge of antibody status should be considered. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

23849,Laparoscopic versus open subtotal gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma: cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy (LSG) for cancer is associated with good perioperative outcomes and superior quality of life compared with the open approach, albeit at higher cost. An economic evaluation was conducted to compare the two approaches. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis between LSG and open subtotal gastrectomy (OSG) for gastric cancer was performed using a decision-tree cohort model with a healthcare system perspective and a 12-month time horizon. Model inputs were informed by a meta-analysis of relevant literature, with costs represented in 2016 Canadian dollars (CAD) and outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). A secondary analysis was conducted using inputs extracted solely from European and North American studies. Deterministic (DSA) and probabilistic (PSA) sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base-case model, costs of LSG were $935 (565) greater than those of OSG, with an incremental gain of 0.050 QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $18 846 (11 398) per additional QALY gained from LSG. In the DSA, results were most sensitive to changes in postoperative utility, operating theatre and equipment costs, as well as duration of surgery and hospital stay. PSA showed that the likelihood of LSG being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50 000 (30 240) per QALY and $100 000 (60 480) per QALY was 64 and 68 per cent respectively. Secondary analysis using European and North American clinical inputs resulted in LSG being dominant (cheaper and more effective) over OSG, largely due to reduced length of stay after LSG. CONCLUSION: In this decision analysis model, LSG was cost-effective compared with OSG for gastric cancer. Copyright © 2020 The Authors.

23850,Cost-effectiveness of Breast Cancer Screening With Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Women at Familial Risk,"Importance: For women with a 20% or more familial risk of breast cancer without a known BRCA1/2 (BRCA1, OMIM 113705; and BRCA2, OMIM 114480) or TP53 (OMIM 151623) variant, screening guidelines vary substantially, and cost-effectiveness analyses are scarce. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening strategies for women with a 20% or more familial risk for breast cancer without a known BRCA1/2 or TP53 variant. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic evaluation, conducted from February 1, 2019, to May 25, 2020, microsimulation modeling was used to estimate costs and effectiveness on a lifetime horizon from age 25 years until death of MRI screening among a cohort of 10 million Dutch women with a 20% or more familial risk for breast cancer without a known BRCA1/2 or TP53 variant. A Dutch screening setting was modeled. Most data were obtained from the randomized Familial MRI Screening (FaMRIsc) trial, which included Dutch women aged 30 to 55 years. A health care payer perspective was applied. Interventions: Several screening protocols with varying ages and intervals including those of the randomized FaMRIsc trial, consisting of the mammography (Mx) protocol (annual mammography and clinical breast examination) and the MRI protocol (annual MRI and clinical breast examination plus biennial mammography). Main Outcomes and Measures: Costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and discounted by 3%. A threshold of 22000 (US $24795.87) per QALY was applied. Results: This economic evaluation modeling study estimated that, on a lifetime horizon per 1000 women with the Mx protocol of the FaMRIsc trial, 346 breast cancers would be detected, and 49 women were estimated to die from breast cancer, resulting in 22885 QALYs and total costs of 7084767 (US $7985134.61). The MRI protocol resulted in 79 additional QALYs and additional 2657266 (US $2994964.65). Magnetic resonance imaging performed only every 18 months between the ages of 35 and 60 years followed by the national screening program was considered optimal, with an ICER of 21380 (US $24097.08) compared with the previous nondominated strategy in the ranking, when applying the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold. Annual screening alternating MRI and mammography between the ages of 35 and 60 years, followed by the national screening program, gave similar outcomes. Higher thresholds would favor annual MRI screening. The ICER was most sensitive to the unit cost of MRI and the utility value for ductal carcinoma in situ and localized breast cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that MRI screening every 18 months between the ages of 35 and 60 years for women with a family history of breast cancer is cost-effective within the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold for all densities. Higher thresholds would favor annual MRI screening. These outcomes support a change of current screening guidelines for this specific risk group and support MRI screening.",2020-01-33496,0,J.

Results: This economic evaluation modeling study estimated that, on a lifetime horizon per 1000 women with the Mx protocol of the FaMRIsc trial, 346 breast cancers would be detected, and 49 women were estimated to die from breast cancer, resulting in 22885 QALYs and total costs of 7084767 (US $7985134.61). The MRI protocol resulted in 79 additional QALYs and additional 2657266 (US $2994964.65). Magnetic resonance imaging performed only every 18 months between the ages of 35 and 60 years followed by the national screening program was considered optimal, with an ICER of 21380 (US $24097.08) compared with the previous nondominated strategy in the ranking, when applying the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold. Annual screening alternating MRI and mammography between the ages of 35 and 60 years, followed by the national screening program, gave similar outcomes. Higher thresholds would favor annual MRI screening. The ICER was most sensitive to the unit cost of MRI and the utility value for ductal carcinoma in situ and localized breast cancer. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that MRI screening every 18 months between the ages of 35 and 60 years for women with a family history of breast cancer is cost-effective within the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence threshold for all densities. Higher thresholds would favor annual MRI screening. These outcomes support a change of current screening guidelines for this specific risk group and support MRI screening.",2020-01-33496,0,J.

23857,Cost-effectiveness of Breast Cancer Screening With Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Women at Familial Risk,"Importance: For women with a 20% or more familial risk of breast cancer without a known BRCA1/2 (BRCA1, OMIM 113705; and BRCA2, OMIM 114480) or TP53 (OMIM 151623) variant, screening guidelines vary substantially, and cost-effectiveness analyses are scarce. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening strategies for women with a 20% or more familial risk for breast cancer without a known BRCA1/2 or TP53 variant. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic evaluation, conducted from February 1, 2019, to May 25, 2020, microsimulation modeling was used to estimate costs and effectiveness on a lifetime horizon from age 25 years until death of MRI screening among a cohort of 10 million Dutch women with a 20% or more familial risk for breast cancer without a known BRCA1/2 or TP53 variant. A Dutch screening setting was modeled. Most data were obtained from the randomized Familial MRI Screening (FaMRIsc) trial, which included Dutch women aged 30 to 55 years. A health care payer perspective was applied. Interventions: Several screening protocols with varying ages and intervals including those of the randomized FaMRIsc trial, consisting of the mammography (Mx) protocol (annual mammography and clinical breast examination) and the MRI protocol (annual MRI and clinical breast examination plus biennial mammography). Main Outcomes and Measures: Costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and discounted by 3%. A threshold of 22000 (US $24795.87) per QALY was applied.

23858,Economic Evaluation of Sedative Deprescribing in Older Adults by Community Pharmacists,"BACKGROUND: Sedative use in older adults increases the risk of falls, fractures, and hospitalizations. The D-PRESCRIBE (Developing Pharmacist-Led Research to Educate and Sensitize Community Residents to the Inappropriate Prescriptions Burden in the Elderly), pragmatic randomized clinical trial demonstrated that community-based, pharmacist-led education delivered simultaneously to older adults and their primary care providers reduce the use of sedatives by 43% over 6 months. However, the associated health benefits and cost savings have yet to be described. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the D-PRESCRIBE intervention compared to usual care for reducing the use of potentially inappropriate sedatives among older adults. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis from the public health care perspective of Canada estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with the D-PRESCRIBE intervention compared to usual care over a 1-year time horizon. Transition probabilities, intervention effectiveness, utility, and costs were derived from the literature. Probabilistic analyses were performed using a decision tree and Markov model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Compared to usual care, pharmacist-led deprescribing is less costly (-$1392.05 CAD) and more effective (0.0769 QALYs). Using common willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50 000 and $100 000, D-PRESCRIBE was the optimal strategy. Scenario analysis indicated the cost-effectiveness of D-PRESCRIBE is sensitive to the rate of deprescribing. CONCLUSIONS: Community pharmacist-led deprescribing of sedatives is cost-effective, leading to greater quality-of-life and harm reduction among older adults. As the pharmacist''s scope of practice expands, consideration should be given to interprofessional models of remuneration for quality prescribing and deprescribing services.

23859,The cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in low surgical risk patients with severe aortic stenosis,"AIMS: The economic value of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in low surgical risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis is not known. Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of balloon-expandable TAVR and self-expandable TAVR relative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in low risk patients. METHODS/RESULTS: A fully probabilistic Markov cohort model was constructed to estimate differences in costs and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) over the patient''s life-time time from the third party payer''s perspective. Clinical outcomes modeled were: alive/well (no complications), permanent stroke, >=moderate paravalvular leak, new pacemaker, rehospitalization, and death. A network meta-analysis of the PARTNER 3 and Evolut Low Risk trial was performed to compare balloon-expandable TAVR, self-expandable TAVR, and SAVR for the efficacy inputs. Incremental-cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated. The total lifetime costs in the balloon-expandable TAVR, self-expandable-TAVR, and SAVR arms were $37,330+/-4,724, $39,660+/-4,862, and $34,583+/-6,731 respectively and total lifetime QALYs gained were 9.15+/-3.23, 9.13+/-3.23, and 9.05+/-3.20 respectively. The ICERs for balloon-expandable TAVR and self-expandable TAVR against SAVR were $27,196/QALY and $59,641/QALY respectively. Balloon-expandable TAVR was less costly and more effective than self-expandable TAVR. There was substantial uncertainty, with 53% and 58% of model iterations showing balloon-expandable TAVR to be the preferred option at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to SAVR, TAVR, particularly with balloon-expandable prostheses may be a cost-effective option for patients with severe aortic stenosis at low surgical risk.

23861,Cost-utility analysis of normothermic liver perfusion with OrganOx compared to static cold storage in the United Kingdom,"Background: Rising numbers of patients on the active transplant list of liver transplantation has led to the utilisation of organs from higher-risk donors that are more likely to be discarded and are prone to post-transplant complications. Storage and transportation of the livers in low temperatures can cause damage. OrganOx metra is a portable device intended to preserve and maintain the donated liver in normothermic conditions for up to 24 hours between the point of retrieval and transplantation. Objective: To evaluate the cost-utility of normothermic machine perfusion with OrganOx metra in liver transplantation compared to the current practice of static cold storage (SCS). Methods: A de novo decision analytic model (a decision tree along with a Markov model), based on current treatment pathways, was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes. Results from a randomised clinical trial and national standard sources were used to inform the model. Costs were estimated from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore uncertainty surrounding input parameters. Results: Over a lifetime time horizon, liver transplantation with OrganOx metra was more costly and more effective than the current practice of static cold storage. The total costs per patient were 37,370 versus 46,711 and the total effectiveness per patient was 9.09 QALYs versus 10.27 QALYs for SCS and OrganOx metra groups, respectively. The estimated ICER was 7,876 per each QALY gained. Results from the PSA showed that use of OrganOx metra has 99% probability of being cost-effective at a 20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. OrganOx metra led to the utilisation of 54 additional livers with patients experiencing lower rates of early allograft dysfunction and adverse events. Conclusions: Use of OrganOx metra for the perfusion and transportation of livers prior to transplantation is a cost-effective strategy. Key Points for Decision MakersIntroduction of OrganOx metra into NHS could increase the utilisation of donated livers with patients experiencing lower rates of early allograft dysfunction and adverse events, compared with current practice. Results of the economic analysis indicate that the OrganOx metra is highly likely to be cost-effective and result in improved patient outcomes.",2020-01-33500,0,Injury Prev.,M Javanbakht,2020,/,1,No,Not Stated,"M Javanbakht; A Mashayekhi; M Trevor; M Branagan-Harris; J Atkinson; Cost-utility analysis of normothermic liver perfusion with OrganOx compared to static cold storage in the United Kingdom, Injury Prev., 2020; ():1369-6998; 1",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Other",organox metra portable normothermic device vs. Standard/Usual Care- static cold storage of livers prior to transplantation,awaiting liver transplantation,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,7876,United Kingdom,2018,10847.21
23862,Niraparib maintenance in frontline management of ovarian cancer: a cost effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Niraparib maintenance after frontline chemotherapy for advanced ovarian cancer extends progression free survival. The objective of this study was to determine the cost effectiveness of niraparib maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. METHODS: Decision analysis models compared the cost of observation versus niraparib maintenance following chemotherapy for five groups: all newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients (overall), those with homologous recombination deficiency, those harboring BRCA mutations (BRCA), homologous recombination deficiency patients without BRCA mutations (homologous recombination deficiency non-BRCA), and non-homologous recombination deficiency patients. Drug costs were estimated using average wholesale prices. Progression free survival was estimated from published data and used to estimate projected overall survival. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios per quality adjusted life year were calculated. Sensitivity analyses varying the cost of niraparib were performed. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at US$100 000 per quality adjusted life year saved. RESULTS: For the overall group, the cost of observation was US$5.8 billion versus $20.5 billion for niraparib maintenance, with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $72 829. For the homologous recombination deficiency group, the observation cost was $3.0 billion versus $14.8 billion for niraparib maintenance (incremental cost effectiveness ratio $56 329). Incremental cost effectiveness ratios for the BRCA, homologous recombination deficiency non-BRCA, and non-homologous recombination deficiency groups were $58 348, $50 914, and $88 741, respectively. For the overall and homologous recombination deficiency groups, niraparib remained cost effective if projected overall survival was 2.2 and 1.5 times progression free survival, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer, maintenance therapy with niraparib was cost effective. Cost effectiveness was improved when analyzing those patients with homologous recombination deficiency and BRCA mutations.

23863,Lenalidomide as maintenance treatment for patients with multiple myeloma after autologous stem cell transplantation: a pharmaco-economic assessment,"OBJECTIVE: Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has improved progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival in eligible patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM); however, relapse occurs. Maintenance therapy with lenalidomide (Len-Mt) extends survival, and delays relapse and the subsequent initiation of costly second-line regimens. Here we report the cost-effectiveness of Len-Mt following ASCT from a Dutch healthcare service perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to assess the lifetime costs and benefits for patients with NDMM. Efficacy was taken from a pooled meta-analysis of clinical trial data. Costs and subsequent therapy data were taken from sources appropriate for the Dutch market. RESULTS: Lenalidomide produced a quality-adjusted life year gain of 2.46 and a life year gain of 2.79 versus no maintenance treatment. The cost of lenalidomide was partially offset by savings of EUR 77,462 in subsequent treatment costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Len-Mt versus no maintenance treatment was EUR 30,143. Key model drivers included subsequent therapies, dosing schedule, and time horizon. CONCLUSION: Lenalidomide is cost-effective after ASCT versus no maintenance therapy in the Netherlands. By extending PFS, lenalidomide delays the cost burdens associated with relapse and subsequent treatment lines. Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A lifetime Markov model was built to estimate outcomes in patients with HFrEF. Health states were defined by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Total Symptom Score, type 2 diabetes and worsening HF events. The incidence of worsening HF and all-cause mortality was estimated using negative binomial regression models and parametric survival analysis, respectively. Direct healthcare costs (2019 British pounds/Euro) and patient-reported outcomes (EQ-5D) were sourced from the existing literature and the Dapagliflozin And Prevention of Adverse-outcomes in Heart Failure trial (DAPA-HF), respectively; the median duration of follow-up in DAPA-HF was 18.2 months (range: 0-27.8). Future costs and effects were discounted at 3.0% for the Spanish and German analyses and 3.5% for the UK analysis. In the UK setting, treatment with dapagliflozin was estimated to increase life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from 5.62 to 6.20 (+0.58) and 4.13 to 4.61 (+0.48), respectively, and reduce lifetime hospitalisations for HF (925 and 820 events per 1,000 patients for placebo and dapagliflozin, respectively). Similar results were obtained for Germany and Spain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 5,822, 5,379 and 9,406/QALY in the UK, Germany and Spain, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, more than 90% of simulations were cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000/QALY in UK and 20,000/QALY in Germany and Spain.

23867,Dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft versus standard of care alone in treatment of Wagner 1 diabetic foot ulcers: A trial-based health economics study,"AIMS: The aim of this health economics study was to estimate the cost-utility of an aseptically processed, dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft (dHACA) plus standard of care (SOC) (group 1) versus SOC alone (group 2) based on a published randomized controlled trial in which patients who had an eligible Wagner 1 diabetic foot ulcer wound were randomized to either of these treatments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov microsimulation was used to project trial results out to a 1-year horizon time with a third-party payer perspective. The starting health state was an unhealed non-infected ulcer with other health states of healed ulcer, infected non-healed ulcer, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and absorbing states of dead or amputation. All patients started with unhealed non-infected ulcers at cycle 0. Costs were incurred by patients for procedures at hospital outpatient wound care provider-based departments (PBDs) and hospitals (if complications occurred) and were calculated using time-based activity costing methods. Effectiveness units were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) computed from literature utility values. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were also conducted. RESULTS: After 1 year, the calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for group 1 versus group 2 was -$4,373 with group 1 (dHACA) being dominant over group 2 (SOC). PSA demonstrated that group 1 had 69.2% lower cost values with increased positive incremental effectiveness for 94.9% of values. A willingness to pay (WTP) curve showed that about 92% of interventions were cost effective for group 1 when $50,000 was paid. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrated that dHACA added to SOC compared to SOC alone was extremely cost-effective in the defined trial population.",2020-01-33504,0,Injury Prev.,MJ Carter,2020,/,1,No,Not Stated,"MJ Carter; Dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft versus standard of care alone in treatment of Wagner 1 diabetic foot ulcers: A trial-based health economics study, Injury Prev., 2020; ():1369-6998; 1",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,dehydrated human amnion and chorion allograft vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard/usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-4368.69,United States,2019,-4422.59
23868,Real-world cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus from a Swedish 1-year and long-term perspective,"Background and Aims: The ReFLeCT study demonstrated that switching to insulin degludec from other basal insulins was associated with reductions in glycated hemoglobin and hypoglycemic events in type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D), and reductions in insulin doses in T1D. The aim of the present analysis was to assess the short- and long-term cost-effectiveness of switching to insulin degludec in Sweden. Methods: Short-term outcomes were evaluated over 1 year in a Microsoft Excel model, while long-term outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Cohort characteristics and treatment effects were sourced from the ReFLeCT study. Costs (in 2018 Swedish krona [SEK]) encompassed direct medical expenditure and indirect costs from loss of workplace productivity. In the long-term analyses, patients were assumed to receive insulin degludec or continue prior insulin therapy (primarily insulin glargine U100) for 5 years, before all patients intensified to once-daily degludec and mealtime aspart. Results: Switching to insulin degludec was associated with improved quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.04 and 0.02 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 1 year, and 0.16 and 0.08 QALYs over patient lifetimes, in T1D and T2D. Combined costs in T1D and T2D were estimated to be SEK 1 249 lower and SEK 1 181 higher over the short term, and SEK 157 258 and SEK 2 114 lower over the long term. Benefits were due to lower insulin doses in T1D, reduced rates of hypoglycemia and lower incidences of diabetes-related complications. Insulin degludec was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of SEK 64 298 per QALY gained for T2D over 1 year and considered dominant for T1D and T2D in all other comparisons.

23872,Cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in chronic heart failure: an analysis from the Australian healthcare perspective,"AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin in addition to standard care versus standard care alone in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed based on the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse Outcomes in Heart Failure trial to assess the clinical outcomes and costs of 1000 hypothetical subjects with established heart failure and reduced ejection fraction. The model consisted of three health states: ''alive and event-free'', ''alive after non-fatal hospitalisation for heart failure'' and ''dead''. Costs and utilities were estimated from published sources. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year gained. An Australian public healthcare perspective was employed. All outcomes and costs were discounted at a rate of 5% annually. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, the addition of dapagliflozin to standard care in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction prevented 88 acute heart failure hospitalisations (including readmissions) and yielded an additional 416 years of life and 288 quality-adjusted life-years (discounted) at an additional cost of A$3,692,440 (discounted). This equated to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of A$12,482 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, well below the Australian willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Subanalyses in subjects with and without diabetes resulted in similar incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of A$13,234 and A$12,386 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively.

23875,High-Frequency 10kHz Spinal Cord Stimulation for Chronic Back and Leg Pain: Cost-consequence and Cost-Effectiveness Analyses,"OBJECTIVES: There is good evidence that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is effective for reducing chronic back and leg pain (CBLP). SENZA-RCT showed high-frequency (10kHz) stimulation (10kHz-SCS) is clinically superior to traditional low-frequency SCS (LF-SCS). Undertake cost-consequence and cost-effectiveness analysis of 10kHz-SCS compared with LF-SCS. METHODS: A probabilistic decision tree and Markov decision analytic model was used to synthesise data on CBLP outcomes and costs over a 15-year time horizon from a UK National Health Service perspective using data from the SENZA-RCT and other publications. Results are expressed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in 2016 Pounds Sterling. RESULTS: 10kHz-SCS is cost-saving and cost-effective compared with LF-SCS, with mean cost savings of 7,170 (95% CI: 6,767 to 7,573) and 3,552 (95% CI: 3,313 to 3,792) per patient compared with non-rechargeable and rechargeable LF-SCS devices, respectively. 10kHz-SCS has a 95% likelihood of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 per QALY.

23877,Cost-effectiveness of Abdominal Ultrasound Versus Magnetic Resonance Imaging for Pancreatic Cancer Screening in Familial High-Risk Individuals in Japan,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess cost-effectiveness of abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and no screening for pancreatic cancer screening in familial high-risk individuals (HRIs). METHODS: We developed decision trees with Markov models for a hypothetical cohort of familial HRIs at the age of 50 year using a healthcare sector perspective and a lifetime horizon. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, abdominal ultrasound was the most cost-effective (US $11,035, 17.4875 QALYs). Magnetic resonance imaging yielded the best benefits. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound was more cost-effective than abdominal ultrasound when the incidence of pancreatic cancer was greater than 0.008 and under 0.016. Magnetic resonance imaging was more cost-effective than endoscopic ultrasound when the incidence of pancreatic cancer was greater than 0.016. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo simulation for 10,000 trials demonstrated that abdominal ultrasound was cost-effective 76% of the time at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US $50,000/QALY gained.

METHODS: We developed decision trees with Markov models for a hypothetical cohort of familial HRIs at the age of 50 year using a healthcare sector perspective and a lifetime horizon. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, abdominal ultrasound was the most cost-effective (US $11,035, 17.4875 QALYs). Magnetic resonance imaging yielded the best benefits. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the incidence of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound was more cost-effective than abdominal ultrasound when the incidence of pancreatic cancer was greater than 0.008 and under 0.016. Magnetic resonance imaging was more cost-effective than endoscopic ultrasound when the incidence of pancreatic cancer was greater than 0.016.

23882,Cost-Effectiveness and Quality-Adjusted Survival of Watch-and-Wait after Complete Response to Chemoradiotherapy for Rectal Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard treatment for locally-advanced rectal cancer. There is interest in de-escalating local therapy after a clinical complete response (cCR) to CRT. We hypothesized that a watch-and-wait (WW) strategy offers comparable cancer-specific survival (CSS), superior quality-adjusted survival, and reduced cost compared to upfront TME. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare WW, low anterior resection (LAR), and abdominoperineal resection (APR) for patients achieving a cCR to CRT. Rates of local regrowth, pelvic recurrence, and distant metastasis were derived from series comparing WW to TME after pathologic complete response. Lifetime incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated between strategies, and sensitivity analyses were performed to study model uncertainty. RESULTS: The base case 5-year CSS was 93.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.5 to 94.9%) on a WW program, compared to 95.9% (95% CI 93.6 to 97.4%) after upfront TME. WW was dominant relative to LAR, with cost savings of $28,500 (95% CI $22,200 to $39,000) and incremental QALY of 0.527 (95% CI 0.138 to 1.125). WW was also dominant relative to APR, with cost savings of $32,100 (95% CI $21,800 to $49,200) and incremental QALY of 0.601 (95% CI 0.213 to 1.208). WW remained dominant in sensitivity analysis unless the rate of surgical salvage fell to 73.0%. CONCLUSIONS: Using current multi-institutional recurrence estimates, we observed comparable CSS, superior quality-adjusted survival, and decreased costs with WW compared to upfront TME. Upfront TME was preferred when surgical salvage rates were low. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

23885,The cost-effectiveness of icosapent ethyl in combination with statin therapy compared with statin alone for cardiovascular risk reduction,"AIMS: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness, from the perspective of the Australian public healthcare system, of icosapent ethyl in combination with statin therapy compared with statin alone for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model populated with data from the Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial was designed to predict the effectiveness and costs of icosapent ethyl in combination with statins compared with statins alone over a 20-year time horizon. Data inputs for costs and utilities were sourced from published sources. The annual costs of icosapent ethyl were assumed to be AUD1637 (USD2907) per person. All future costs and outcomes were discounted annually by 5%. The main outcome of interest was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and per year of life saved (YoLS). Over a 20-year time horizon, compared with statin alone, icosapent ethyl in combination with statin was estimated to cost an additional AUD$13,022 per person, but led to 0.338 YoLS and 0.289 QALYs gained (all discounted). These equated to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of AUD45,036 per QALY gained and AUD38,480 per YoLS. Sub-analyses for primary and secondary prevention were AUD96,136 and AUD35,935 per QALY gained, respectively. The results were sensitive to time-horizon, age related trends and the acquisition price of icosapent ethyl.

23888,Early Surgery Versus Biologic Therapy in Limited Nonstricturing Ileocecal Crohn's Disease-A Decision-making Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Surgery is the preferred option for patients with symptomatic localized fibrostenotic ileocecal Crohn''s disease (CD) but not for those with predominantly active inflammation without obstruction. The benefit of early surgery in patients with a limited nonstricturing ileocecal CD over biologic treatment is still a debate. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to formulate a decision analysis model based on recently published data to explore whether early surgery in patients with limited nonstricturing CD is preferred over biologic treatment. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model comparing 2 strategies of treatment: (1) early surgery vs (2) biologic treatment. To estimate the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the costs in each strategy, we simulated 10,000 virtual patients with the Markov model using a Monte Carlo simulation 100 times. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model and address uncertainties in the estimation of model parameters. RESULTS: The costs were $29,457 +/- $407 and $50,382 +/- $525 (mean +/- SD) for early surgery strategy and biologic treatment strategy, respectively. The QALY was 6.24 +/- 0.01 and 5.81 +/- 0.01 for early surgery strategy and biologic treatment strategy, respectively. CONCLUSION: The strategy of early surgery dominates (higher QALY value [efficacy] and less cost) compared with the strategy of biologic treatment in patients with limited ileocecal CD.

23889,Cost-Effectiveness of Maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin for Intermediate and High Risk Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer,"PURPOSE: While guidelines support the use of maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin for patients with intermediate and high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, in an era of bacillus Calmette-Guerin shortage we explored the cost-effectiveness of maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model compared the cost-effectiveness of maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin to surveillance after induction bacillus Calmette-Guerin for intermediate/high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer from a U.S. Medicare perspective. Five-year oncologic outcomes, toxicity rates and utility values were extracted from the literature. Univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted. A willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per quality adjusted life year was considered cost-effective. RESULTS: At 5 years mean costs per patient were $14,858 and $13,973 for maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin and surveillance, respectively, with quality adjusted life years of 4.046 for both, making surveillance the dominant strategy. On sensitivity analysis full dose and 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin became cost-effective if the absolute reduction in 5-year progression was greater than 2.1% and greater than 0.76%, respectively. On further sensitivity analysis full dose and 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin became cost-effective when maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin toxicity equaled surveillance toxicity. In multivariable sensitivity analyses using 100,000 Monte-Carlo microsimulations, full dose and 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin was cost-effective in 17% and 39% of microsimulations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Neither full dose nor 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin appears cost-effective for the entire population of patients with intermediate/high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer. These data support prioritizing maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin for the subset of patients with high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer most likely to experience progression, in particular those who tolerated induction bacillus Calmette-Guerin well. Overall, our findings support the American Urological Association policy statement to allocate bacillus Calmette-Guerin for induction rather than maintenance therapy during times of bacillus Calmette-Guerin shortage.",2020-01-33520,0,PLoS Med.,V Sharma,2020,204 /,442-449,No,Not Stated,"V Sharma; KM Wymer; BJ Borah; CS Saigal; MS Litwin; VT Packiam; RH Thompson; MK Tollefson; RJ Karnes; SA Boorjian; Cost-Effectiveness of Maintenance bacillus Calmette-Guerin for Intermediate and High Risk Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer, PLoS Med., 2020; 204():1549-1277; 442-449",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical",surveillance vs. Standard/Usual Care- maintenance bacillus calmette-guerin,intermediate and high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer post-induction,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2018,Not Stated
23890,Cost-Effectiveness of Preoperative OCT in Cataract Evaluation for Multifocal Intraocular Lens,"PURPOSE: To determine the cost effectiveness of an adjunctive screening OCT during the preoperative evaluation of a patient considering cataract surgery with a multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. PARTICIPANTS: A 67-year-old man with 20/60 vision undergoing evaluation for first-eye cataract surgery. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis of the reference patient undergoing a preoperative cataract examination with and without a screening OCT was performed, evaluating for vitreoretinal diseases including an epiretinal membrane, age-related macular degeneration, vitreomacular traction, and cystoid macular edema. It was assumed that patients with macular pathologies detected before surgery would receive a monofocal IOL and be referred to a retina specialist for evaluation and management. The Medicare reimbursable cost of an OCT was $41.81. All costs and benefits were adjusted for inflation to 2019 United States dollars and discounted 3% per annum over a 16-year time horizon. Probability sensitivity analyses and 1-way deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess for uncertainty. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Approximately 20.5% of patients undergoing cataract surgery may have macular pathologies, of which 11% may not be detected on the initial clinical examination. In the base case, an adjunctive preoperative OCT was cost effective from a third-party payer and societal perspective in the United States. In the probability sensitivity analyses, the ICURs were within the societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY in approximately 64.4% of the clinical scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: A preoperative screening OCT during the evaluation of a patient considering a multifocal IOL added to the costs of the cataract surgery, but the OCT increased the detection of macular pathologies and improved the QALYs over time. An adjunctive screening OCT can be cost effective from a third-party payer and societal perspective. Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

23891,Cost-Effectiveness of Preoperative OCT in Cataract Evaluation for Multifocal Intraocular Lens,"PURPOSE: To determine the cost effectiveness of an adjunctive screening OCT during the preoperative evaluation of a patient considering cataract surgery with a multifocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. PARTICIPANTS: A 67-year-old man with 20/60 vision undergoing evaluation for first-eye cataract surgery. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis of the reference patient undergoing a preoperative cataract examination with and without a screening OCT was performed, evaluating for vitreoretinal diseases including an epiretinal membrane, age-related macular degeneration, vitreomacular traction, and cystoid macular edema. It was assumed that patients with macular pathologies detected before surgery would receive a monofocal IOL and be referred to a retina specialist for evaluation and management. The Medicare reimbursable cost of an OCT was $41.81. All costs and benefits were adjusted for inflation to 2019 United States dollars and discounted 3% per annum over a 16-year time horizon. Probability sensitivity analyses and 1-way deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess for uncertainty. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Approximately 20.5% of patients undergoing cataract surgery may have macular pathologies, of which 11% may not be detected on the initial clinical examination. In the base case, an adjunctive preoperative OCT was cost effective from a third-party payer and societal perspective in the United States. In the probability sensitivity analyses, the ICURs were within the societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY in approximately 64.4% of the clinical scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: A preoperative screening OCT during the evaluation of a patient considering a multifocal IOL added to the costs of the cataract surgery, but the OCT increased the detection of macular pathologies and improved the QALYs over time. An adjunctive screening OCT can be cost effective from a third-party payer and societal perspective. Copyright © 2020 American Academy of Ophthalmology. Published by Elsevier Inc.

23892,Lenalidomide plus rituximab Vs rituximab alone in relapsed or refractory indolent lymphoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of lenalidomide plus rituximab vs rituximab alone in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent lymphoma. METHODS: A Markov decision model was established to carry out the cost-effectiveness analysis. Three discrete health states, progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD), and death, were included. Cycle length was set at 1 month, and utility scores were derived from previously published literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was defined as the primary endpoint, and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $29,306.43 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Both cost and effectiveness were determined using a 3% annual discount rate. Furthermore, one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to check the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Lenalidomide plus rituximab gained 6.08 QALYs at a cost of $120,979.62 while rituximab alone gained 4.84 QALYs at a cost of $48,052.11. The ICER of lenalidomide plus rituximab vs rituximab alone was $58,812.51/QALY. The parameters most significantly influenced the model were the utility values for the PFS state, the duration of the PFS state in the lenalidomide plus rituximab group, and the cost of lenalidomide. The probability of lenalidomide plus rituximab or rituximab alone being the most cost-effective option was 0% and 100%, respectively, at a WTP threshold of $29,306.43/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Lenalidomide plus rituximab is not a cost-effective strategy compared with rituximab monotherapy for relapsed or refractory indolent lymphoma from a Chinese societal perspective.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of usual care with and without telemonitoring-guided management in patients with CHF discharged from the hospital, from the perspective of US health care providers. METHODS: A lifelong Markov model was designed to estimate outcomes of (1) usual care alone for all postdischarge patients with CHF (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class I-IV), (2) usual care and telemonitoring for all postdischarge patients with CHF, (3) usual care for all postdischarge patients with CHF and telemonitoring for patients with NYHA class III to IV, and (4) usual care for all postdischarge patients with CHF plus telemonitoring for patients with NYHA class II to IV. Model inputs were derived from the literature and public data. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of model. The primary outcomes were total direct medical cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In the base case analysis, universal telemonitoring group gained the highest QALYs (6.2967 QALYs), followed by the telemonitoring for NYHA class II to IV group (6.2960 QALYs), the telemonitoring for NYHA class III to IV group (6.2450 QALYs), and the universal usual care group (6.1530 QALYs). ICERs of the telemonitoring for NYHA class III to IV group (US $35,393 per QALY) and the telemonitoring for NYHA class II to IV group (US $38,261 per QALY) were lower than the ICER of the universal telemonitoring group (US $100,458 per QALY). One-way sensitivity analysis identified five critical parameters: odds ratio of hospitalization for telemonitoring versus usual care, hazard ratio of all-cause mortality for telemonitoring versus usual care, CHF hospitalization cost and monthly outpatient costs for NYHA class I, and CHF hospitalization cost for NYHA class II. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, probabilities of the universal telemonitoring, telemonitoring for NYHA class II to IV, telemonitoring for NYHA class III to IV, and universal usual care groups to be accepted as cost-effective at US $50,000 per QALY were 2.76%, 76.31%, 18.6%, and 2.33%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Usual care for all discharged patients with CHF plus telemonitoring-guided management for NYHA class II to IV patients appears to be the preferred cost-effective strategy.

23900,Cost-effectiveness analysis of cinacalcet for haemodialysis patients with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism in China: evaluation based on the EVOLVE trial,"OBJECTIVE: As the cost-effectiveness evaluation of cinacalcet and conventional therapy in China has not been reported, the objective of this study was to make a pharmacoeconomic evaluation of cinacalcet specific to the Chinese healthcare setting in patients with moderate-to-severe secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) undergoing dialysis. DESIGNS: Data from Evaluation of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events trial were used for this analysis. A semi-Markov model was constructed to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime costs in cinacalcet plus conventional therapy (cinacalcet strategy) compared with conventional therapy (standard strategy), in patients with moderate-to-severe SHPT undergoing dialysis. Treatment effect estimates from the unadjusted intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis and covariate-adjusted ITT analysis were used as the main analyses. Model sensitivity to variations in individual inputs and overall decision uncertainty were assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analyses. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as measured by cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: The ICER for cinacalcet strategy was US$44 400 per QALY gained using the covariate-adjusted ITT analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a 46.2% chance of the ICER being below a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$26 508. Treatment effects from unadjusted ITT analysis yielded an ICER of US$87 210 per QALY. The model was most sensitive to the treatment effect on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Existing evidence does not support the cost-effectiveness of cinacalcet strategy in patients with moderate-to-severe SHPT undergoing dialysis when applying a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$26 508 per QALY, whether it is using the treatment effect from covariate-adjusted ITT analysis or unadjusted ITT analysis.
