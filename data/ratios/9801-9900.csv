9801,Cost-Effectiveness of an Electronic Medical Record Based Clinical Decision Support System,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Medical groups have invested billions of dollars in electronic medical records (EMRs), but few studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of EMR-based clinical decision support (CDS). This study examined the cost-effectiveness of EMR-based CDS for adults with diabetes from the perspective of the health care system. DATA SOURCES/SETTING: Clinical outcome and cost data from a randomized clinical trial of EMR-based CDS were used as inputs into a diabetes simulation model. The simulation cohort included 1,092 patients with diabetes with A1c above goal at baseline. STUDY DESIGN: The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model, a validated simulation model of diabetes, was used to evaluate remaining life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and health care costs over patient lifetimes (40-year time horizon) from the health system perspective. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Patients in the intervention group had significantly lowered A1c (0.26 percent, p?=?.014) relative to patients in the control arm. Intervention costs were $120 (SE?=?45) per patient in the first year and $76 (SE?=?45) per patient in the following years. In the base case analysis, EMR-based CDS increased lifetime QALYs by 0.04 (SE?=?0.01) and increased lifetime costs by $112 (SE?=?660), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3,017 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness of EMR-based CDS persisted in one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread adoption of sophisticated EMR-based CDS has the potential to modestly improve the quality of care for patients with chronic conditions without substantially increasing costs to the health care system.",2012-01-09096,22578085,Health Serv Res,Todd P Gilmer,2012,47 / 6,,No,22578085,"Todd P Gilmer; Patrick J O'Connor; Joann M Sperl-Hillen; William A Rush; Paul E Johnson; Gerald H Amundson; Stephen E Asche; Heidi L Ekstrom; Cost-Effectiveness of an Electronic Medical Record Based Clinical Decision Support System, Health Serv Res, ; 47(6):0017-9124",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Electronic medical record (EMR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,3766.67,United States,2009,4543.99
9802,Cost-Effectiveness of Hypothermic Machine Preservation Versus Static Cold Storage in Renal Transplantation,"Static cold storage (CS) is the most widely used organ preservation method for deceased donor kidney grafts but there is increasing evidence that hypothermic machine perfusion (MP) may result in better outcome after transplantation. We performed an economic evaluation of MP versus CS alongside a multicenter RCT investigating short- and long-term cost-effectiveness. Three hundred thirty-six consecutive kidney pairs were included, one of which was assigned to MP and one to CS. The economic evaluation combined the short-term results based on the empirical data from the study with a Markov model with a 10-year time horizon. Direct medical costs of hospital stay, dialysis treatment, and complications were included. Data regarding long-term survival, quality of life, and long-term costs were derived from literature. The short-term evaluation showed that MP reduced the risk of delayed graft function and graft failure at lower costs than CS. The Markov model revealed cost savings of $86 750 per life-year gained in favor of MP. The corresponding incremental cost-utility ratio was minus $496 223 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We conclude that life-years and QALYs can be gained while reducing costs at the same time, when kidneys are preserved by MP instead of CS.",2012-01-09097,22578189,Am J Transplant,H Groen,2012,12 / 7,,No,22578189,"H Groen; C Moers; J M Smits; J Treckmann; D Monbaliu; A Rahmel; A Paul; J Pirenne; R J Ploeg; E Buskens; Cost-Effectiveness of Hypothermic Machine Preservation Versus Static Cold Storage in Renal Transplantation, Am J Transplant, ; 12(7):1600-6135",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hypothermic machine perfusion (MP) organ preservation vs. Static cold storage organ preservation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,4.00,4.00,-695964.56,United States,2011,-800765.03
9803,Cost-effectiveness of denosumab versus zoledronic Acid in the management of skeletal metastases secondary to breast cancer,"Denosumab has been approved in the United States for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in metastatic breast cancer. In a Phase III trial in patients with bone-metastatic breast cancer (N = 2033), denosumab was associated with a significantly delayed time to first SRE (by 18%; P < 0.001 noninferiority; P = 0.01 superiority) and time to first and subsequent SREs (by 23%; P = 0.001). Overall survival (HR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.81-1.11; P = 0.49) and disease progression (HR = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.89-1.11; P = 0.93) did not differ significantly between groups. Denosumab was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in serious adverse events (44.4% vs 46.5%).Given the current ambiguity regarding the cost-effectiveness of these agents in light of these trial outcomes, the present analysis assessed, from a US payer perspective, the cost-effectiveness of denosumab versus zoledronic acid in patients with bone metastases secondary to breast cancer.A literature-based Markov model was developed to estimate the survival, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, number and costs of SREs, and drug and administration costs in patients receiving denosumab or zoledronic acid over 27 and 60 months. Clinical inputs reproduced the trial outcomes. SRE-related costs and utilities were literature based. Costs and QALYs were discounted 3% annually.In the 27-month base-case analysis, denosumab was associated with fewer SREs (-0.298), more QALYs (+0.0102), and lower SRE-related costs (-$2016), but higher drug-related (+$9123) and total costs (+$7107) versus zoledronic acid. The cost per QALY gained (ie, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) was $697,499. In sensitivity analyses, the ICER ranged from $192,472 to $1,340,901/QALY, depending on assumptions regarding treatment benefits, drug costs, and analytical horizon. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, denosumab was cost-effective in 2 of 5000 modeled replicates (0.04%).Despite the limitations of restricted availability of clinical data and uncertainty regarding the price of generic zoledronic acid, the findings from the present analysis suggest that the use of denosumab is associated with a high ICER compared with zoledronic acid. This finding may raise important questions regarding the economic value of denosumab in bone-metastatic breast cancer.",2012-01-09099,22578308,Clin Ther,Sonya J Snedecor,2012,34 / 6,1334-49,Yes,22578308,"Sonya J Snedecor; John A Carter; Satyin Kaura; Marc F Botteman; Cost-effectiveness of denosumab versus zoledronic Acid in the management of skeletal metastases secondary to breast cancer, Clin Ther, ; 34(6):1879-114X; 1334-49",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Denosumab vs. Zoledronic acid,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,27 Months,3.00,3.00,697499,United States,2010,827862.63

9808,Treatment of Malignant Pleural Effusion: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Patients with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) have varied expected survival and treatment options. We studied the relative cost-effectiveness of various interventions. METHODS: Decision analysis was used to compare repeated thoracentesis (RT), tunneled pleural catheter (TPC), bedside pleurodesis (BP), and thoracoscopic pleurodesis (TP). Outcomes and utility data were obtained from institutional data and review of literature. Medicare allowable charges were used to ensure uniformity. Base case analysis was performed for two scenarios: expected survival of 3 months and expected survival of 12 months. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated as the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained over the patient's remaining lifetime. RESULTS: Under base case analysis for 3-month survival, RT was the least expensive treatment ($4,946) and provided the fewest utilities (0.112 quality-adjusted life-years). The cost of therapy for the other options was TPC $6,450, BP $11,224, and TP $18,604. Tunneled pleural catheter dominated both pleurodesis arms, namely, TPC was both less expensive and more effective. The ICER for TPC over RT was $49,978. The ICER was sensitive to complications and ability to achieve pleural sclerosis with TPC. Under base case analysis for 12-month survival, BP was the least expensive treatment ($13,057) and provided 0.59 quality-adjusted life-years.

9812,Canadian cost- utility analysis of intravenous immunoglobulin for acute childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"BackgroundIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a hematological disorder and can be classified as acute or chronic. The main goal of treatment for acute childhood ITP is the prevention of potentially fatal bleeding complications, the most serious of which is intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Treatment options for acute childhood ITP include splenectomy, corticosteroids, and blood products such as intravenous immunoglobulin.ObjectivesThe objective was to evaluate, from a Canadian perspective, the cost-effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) compared to alternative inpatient treatments for acute childhood idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).?MethodsA Markov model with a lifelong time horizon was used to evaluate the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for 5 treatments for children hospitalized for ITP: 1) no treatment; 2) IVIG; 3) Anti-D; 4) prednisone; and 5) methylprednisolone. The model predicted the probability of intracranial hemorrhage for each treatment strategy based on the time children spent with platelet counts <20,000?L. The time patients spent with platelet counts <20,000?L with each treatment was estimated by pooling data from published randomized clinical trials. In the basecase analysis, the cohort was assumed to weigh 20kg. Cost and utility model variables were based upon various literature sources. Parameter uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.ResultsThe treatment strategies that comprised the efficiency frontier were prednisone, Anti-D and IVIG. The incremental cost per QALY was $53,333 moving from prednisone to Anti-D and $53,846 moving from Anti-D to IVIG. Results were sensitive to patient weight. If patient weight is 10kg, IVIG dominates all other strategies and if weight is increased to 30kg, the cost per QALY of IVIG is $163,708.ConclusionBased on common willingness to pay thresholds, IVIG might be considered a cost effective treatment for acute childhood ITP.

9816,Cost-Effectiveness of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) Goal of Increasing Linkage to Care for HIV-Infected Persons,"BACKGROUND:: One of the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) is to increase the proportion of HIV-infected individuals linked to care within 3 months of diagnosis (early linkage) from 65% to 85%. Earlier access to care, and eventually, to treatment, increases life-expectancy and quality of life for HIV-infected persons. However, longer treatment is also associated with higher costs, especially for antiretroviral drugs. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of achieving the NHAS goal and estimated the maximum cost that HIV programs could spend on linkage to care and remain cost-effective. METHODS:: We used the Progression and Transmission of HIV/AIDS (PATH) model to estimate the effects on life-measures and costs associated with increasing early linkage to care from 65% to 85%. We estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio as the additional cost required to reach the target divided by the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and assumed that programs costing $100,000 or less per QALY gained are cost-effective. RESULTS:: Achieving the NHAS linkage-to-care goal increased life expectancy by 0.4 years and delayed the onset of AIDS by 1.2 years on average for every HIV-diagnosed person. Increasing early linkage to care cost an extra $62,200 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, considering only benefits to index persons. The maximum that could be cost-effectively spent on early linkage-to-care interventions was approximately $ 5,100 per HIV-diagnosed person. CONCLUSION:: Considerable investment can be cost-effectively made to achieve the NHAS goal on early linkage to care.",2012-01-09105,22580563,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Chaitra Gopalappa,2012,61 / 1,,No,22580563,"Chaitra Gopalappa; Paul G Farnham; Angela B Hutchinson; Stephanie L Sansom; Cost-Effectiveness of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) Goal of Increasing Linkage to Care for HIV-Infected Persons, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, Sep/1/2012; 61(1):1525-4135",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Brief case-management intervention trial for increasing linkage to care for recently diagnosed HIV infected person includes up to 5 sessions with a case manager over a 90-day period (Antiretroviral Treatment Access Study (ARTAS) Program) vs. Standard of care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,Not Stated,62168,United States,2009,74997.61
9817,Cost-effectiveness of fingolimod versus interferon beta-1a for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in the United States,"Abstract Objective: Fingolimod has been shown to be more efficacious than interferon (IFN) beta-1a, but at a higher drug acquisition cost. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of fingolimod compared to IFN beta-1a in patients diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in the US. Methods: A Markov model comparing fingolimod to intramuscular IFN beta-1a using a US societal perspective and a 10-year time horizon was developed. A cohort of 37-year-old patients with RRMS and a Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale score of 0-2.5 were assumed. Data sources included the Trial Assessing Injectable Interferon vs FTY720 Oral in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (TRANSFORMS) and other published studies of MS. Outcomes included costs in 2011 US dollars, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), number of relapses avoided, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: Compared to IFN beta-1a, fingolimod was associated with fewer relapses (0.41 vs 0.73 per patient per year) and more QALYs gained (6.7663 vs 5.9503), but at a higher cost ($565,598 vs $505,234). This resulted in an ICER of $73,975 per QALY. Results were most sensitive to changes in drug costs and the disutility of receiving IFN beta-1a. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated fingolimod was cost-effective in 35% and 70% of 10,000 iterations, assuming willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY, respectively. Limitations: Event rates were primarily derived from a single randomized clinical trial with 1-year duration of follow-up and extrapolated to a 10-year time horizon. Comparison was made to only one disease-modifying drug-intramuscular IFN beta-1a. Conclusion: Fingolimod use is not likely to be cost-effective compared to IFN beta-1a unless fingolimod cost falls below $3476 per month or a higher than normal willingness-to-pay threshold is accepted by decision-makers.",2012-01-09109,22583065,J Med Econ,Soyon Lee,2012,15 / 6,,Yes,22583065,"Soyon Lee; Daniel C Baxter; Brendan Limone; Matthew S Roberts; Craig I Coleman; Cost-effectiveness of fingolimod versus interferon beta-1a for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis in the United States, J Med Econ, ; 15(6):1369-6998",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fingolimod (0.5 mg orally once daily) vs. Interferon (IFN) beta-1a (30 mcg intramuscularly (IM) once weekly),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,73975,United States,2011,85114.38

9820,The cost-effectiveness of primary prophylactic implantable defibrillator therapy in patients with ischaemic or non-ischaemic heart disease: a European analysis,"AIMS: It remains unclear whether primary prophylactic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy is cost-effective compared with a ''no ICD strategy'' in the European health care setting. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis for a cohort of patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction <40% and ischaemic or non-ischaemic heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to evaluate long-term survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime costs for a cohort of patients with a reduced left ventricular function without previous arrhythmias, managed with a prophylactic ICD. Input data on effectiveness were derived from a meta-analysis of primary prophylactic ICD-only therapy randomized trials, from a prospective cohort study of ICD patients, from a health care utilization survey, and from the literature. Input data on costs were derived from a micro-cost analysis. Data on quality-of-life were derived from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the uncertainty. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated a mean lifetime cost of euro50 685 +/- euro4604 and 6.26 +/- 0.64 QALYs for patients in the ''no ICD strategy''. Patients in the ''ICD strategy'' accumulated euro86 759 +/- euro3343 and an effectiveness of 7.08 +/- 0.71 QALYs yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro43 993/QALY gained compared with the ''no ICD strategy''. The probability that ICD therapy is cost-effective was 65% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro80 000/QALY.

9822,Health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness of treatment in subarachnoid haemorrhage,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) demands high healthcare resource utilization. Case fatality and disability remain as common outcomes of SAH. The purpose of this study was to perform a treatment cost-effectiveness analysis of patients with SAH. METHODS: We performed a long-term follow-up of the SAH patients treated in our institution over 3-year period starting February 1998. Outcome 10?years after the SAH and treatment costs were evaluated. The health-related quality of life was evaluated using the Euroqol (EQ-5D) questionnaire and visual-analogue scale (VAS). The cost of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was calculated. RESULTS: Median follow-up time of the 178 patients was 10.8?years. Overall mortality rate was 24%. Of the 43 non-survivors, 42% died within 6?months. For the 135 survivors, the median EQ-5D index value was 1.00, which is similar to that for normal population. The median VAS value was 80, which is comparable to normal population's value. Of the survivors, 88% (119/135) were able to live at home and 63% (85/135) returned to work after SAH. The cost of neurosurgical treatment for one QALY was 1700?. CONCLUSION: Long-term outcome of survivors after aneurysmal SAH was relatively good: Most of them lived at home, 63% had returned to work and 36% was still working. The quality of life index of the survivors was similar to that of normal populations, and the survivors were as satisfied with their health as people in general are.

9823,A cost-effectiveness analysis of the effect of pregabalin versus usual care in the treatment of refractory neuropathic pain in routine medical practice in Spain,"Objective. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin vs usual care (UC) in outpatients with refractory neuropathic pain (NeP), treated according to routine medical practice in primary care settings in Spain. Methods. Patients were extracted from a 12-week noninterventional prospective study conducted to ascertain the costs of NeP. Pairs of pregabalin-na?ve patients receiving UC or pregabalin, matched by age, gender, pain intensity, and refractory to previous treatment, were selected in a 1:1 ratio. Refractory was considered a patient with actual pain (scoring >40 in a 100 mm in a pain visual analog scale) after receiving a course of a standard analgesic, at its recommended doses. Perspectives of the Spanish National Healthcare System and society were included in the analysis. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gain. Results of the cost-effectiveness analysis were expressed as an incremental cost per QALY (ICER) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using bootstrapping techniques was also carried out. Results. A total of 160 pairs were extracted. Compared with UC, pregabalin was associated with significantly higher QALY gain; 0.0374 ? 0.0367 vs 0.0224 ? 0.0313 (P < 0.001). Despite drug acquisition costs being higher for pregabalin (?251 ? 125 vs ?104 ? 121; P < 0.001), total and health care costs incurred for pregabalin were similar in both groups; ?1,335 ? 1,302 vs ?1,387 ? 1,489 (P = 0.587) and ?529 ? 438 vs ?560 ? 672 (P = 0.628), respectively, yielding a dominant ICER for both total and health care costs in the base case scenario; 95% confidence intervals, respectively, dominant to ?17,268, and dominant to ?6,508.

METHODS: Data was extracted from a 12-week registry study assessing costs of neuropathic pain in Spain. Pregabalin-na?ve outpatients treated with UC or newly prescribed pregabalin were selected for inclusion in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gain. Perspectives of the Spanish National Health System (NHS) and society (2006) were applied for cost calculations. Results were expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Bootstrapping techniques (10,000 re-samples) were used to obtain the probabilistic ICER and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. RESULTS: A total of 189 patients were included in the economic analysis. Compared with UC, pregabalin was associated with higher QALY gain in a period of 12-weeks; 0.0406?0.0343 versus 0.0285?0.0350 (p=0.167). Overall total costs (?1368?1229 vs. ?1258?1474; p=0.587) and healthcare costs (?628?590 vs. ?469?420; p=0.134) were similar for both pregabalin and UC, respectively.

Results were expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Bootstrapping techniques (10,000 re-samples) were used to obtain the probabilistic ICER and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. RESULTS: A total of 189 patients were included in the economic analysis. Compared with UC, pregabalin was associated with higher QALY gain in a period of 12-weeks; 0.0406?0.0343 versus 0.0285?0.0350 (p=0.167). Overall total costs (?1368?1229 vs. ?1258?1474; p=0.587) and healthcare costs (?628?590 vs. ?469?420; p=0.134) were similar for both pregabalin and UC, respectively. ICERs for pregabalin varied from ?5302 (95% CI: dominant; ?144,105) for total costs to ?14,381 (dominant; ?115,648) for healthcare costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that 79-84% of ICERs were below the threshold of ?30,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that pregabalin may be cost-effective in the management of community-treated refractory outpatients, with pDPN when compared with usual care in the primary care setting in Spain.

9826,Cost-Utility of Inflammation-Targeted Therapy for Patients with Ulcerative Colitis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS:: Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs are frequently used to treat patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC). However, these drugs are costly, and long-term adherence is poor. We compared the cost utility of inflammation-targeted, intermittent therapy with that of universal, continuous maintenance therapy with 5-ASA agents for patients with mild to moderate UC. METHODS:: We developed a Markov cohort model that simulated a population of adult patients with newly diagnosed, quiescent UC after induction of remission with 5-ASA agents. We obtained model inputs from the literature. The perspective taken was that of a short-term payer (health insurance provider) over a 5-year time period. We modeled 3 treatment strategies: symptom-targeted treatment (treatment for symptomatic disease flares only, SYMPT), continuous 5-ASA maintenance for all patients (CONT, the current standard of care), and inflammation-targeted treatment (5-ASA therapy for only patients with a stool sample positive for an inflammatory marker, INFLAM). We measured disease flares, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (2009 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS:: INFLAM was the least costly strategy (cumulative per-patient cost of $22,798), compared to $24,378 for the SYMPT and $25,621 for the CONT strategies. Despite the lower cost, INFLAM was comparable to SYMPT and CONT in effectiveness (4.4986 vs 4.5014 QALYs, respectively), making INFLAM the optimal strategy. Several variables were found to be important in sensitivity analysis; the CONT strategy was optimal only if the cost of 5-ASA drugs was markedly reduced.

9828,Cost effectiveness of peer support for type 2 diabetes,"Objectives: The aim of this study is to examine the cost-effectiveness of a group-based peer support intervention in general practice for patients with type 2 diabetes.Methods: Incremental cost utility analysis combining within trial and beyond trial components to compare the lifetime costs and benefits of alternative strategies: Control: standardized diabetes care; Intervention: group-based peer support in addition to standardized diabetes care. Within trial analysis was based on a cluster randomized controlled trial of 395 patients with type 2 diabetes in the east of Ireland. Beyond trial analysis was conducted using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model. Uncertainty was explored using a range of sensitivity analyses and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated.Results: Compared with the control strategy, the intervention was associated with an increase of 0.09 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], -0.05 to 0.25) in mean quality-adjusted life-years per patient and savings of ?637.43 (95 percent CI, -2455.19 to 1125.45) in mean healthcare cost per patient and ?623.39 (95 percent CI, -2507.98 to 1298.49) in mean total cost per patient respectively. The likelihood of the intervention being cost-effective was appreciably higher than 80 percent for a range of potential willingness-to-pay cost-effectiveness thresholds.Conclusions: Our results suggest that while a group-based peer support intervention shows a trend toward improved risk factor management, we found no significant differences in final cost or effectiveness endpoints between intervention and control.

9829,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the neuroprotective agent edaravone for noncardioembolic cerebral infarction,"BACKGROUND: The free radical scavenger edaravone has been reported useful for improvement in activities of daily living and for prevention of recurrent stroke in the edaravone versus sodium ozagrel in acute noncardioembolic ischemic stroke (EDO) trial. The aim of this report was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of edaravone compared to the intravenous antiplatelet drug ozagrel sodium (ozagrel) for noncardioembolic stroke (non-CES) based on the EDO trial data. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the Markov model, which also incorporated the long-term course after the acute stage of non-CES. From the perspective of a health care payer, direct medical costs and nursing care costs were taken into account in the cost analysis. The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) served as an indicator of effectiveness. Simulation at 5 and 10 years after the onset of non-CES was carried out. The study involved 68-year-old patients with non-CES, selected against the EDO trial subject selection criteria. A 14-day treatment with edaravone 60 mg/day or ozagrel 160 mg/day was assumed as acute treatment for non-CES. RESULTS: The use of edaravone was associated with a reduction in total costs (0.51 million yen [$6,374] at 5 years and 0.64 million yen [$8,039]) at 10 years after the onset of non-CES) and improvement in QALYs (0.23 at 5 years and 0.38 at 10 years). Compared to ozagrel therapy, edaravone therapy was a cost-saving strategy for treating non-CES.

9830,Economic impact of combination therapy with infliximab plus azathioprine for drug-refractory Crohn's disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with infliximab (IFX) and azathioprine (AZA) is significantly more effective for treatment of active Crohn''s disease (CD) than IFX monotherapy. However, AZA is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with IFX plus AZA for drug-refractory CD. METHODS: A decision analysis model is constructed to compare, over a time horizon of 1year, the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with IFX plus AZA and that of IFX monotherapy for CD patients refractory to conventional non-anti-TNF-alpha therapy. The treatment efficacy, adverse effects, quality-of-life scores, and treatment costs are derived from published data. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses are performed to estimate the uncertainty in the results. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of combination therapy with IFX plus AZA is 24,917 GBP/QALY when compared with IFX monotherapy. The sensitivity analyses reveal that the utility score of nonresponding active disease has the strongest influence on the cost-effectiveness, with ICERs ranging from 17,147 to 45,564 GBP/QALY. Assuming that policy makers are willing to pay 30,000 GBP/QALY, the probability that combination therapy with IFX plus AZA is cost-effective is 0.750. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with IFX plus AZA appears to be a cost-effective treatment for drug-refractory CD when compared with IFX monotherapy.

9831,The Cost-Effectiveness of Radiofrequency Ablation for Barrett's Esophagus,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) reduces the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) in patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) with high grade dysplasia (HGD), but its effects in patients without dysplasia are debatable. We analyzed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of RFA for the management of BE. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic Markov model. We conducted separate analyses of hypothetical cohorts of patients with BE with dysplasia (HGD or low-grade [LGD]) and without dysplasia. In the analysis of the group with HGD, we compared results of the initial RFA to endoscopic surveillance with surgery when cancer was detected. In analyzing the group with LGD or no dysplasia, we compared 3 strategies: endoscopic surveillance with surgery when cancer detected (S1), endoscopic surveillance with RFA when HGD detected (S2), and initial RFA followed by endoscopic surveillance (S3). RESULTS: Among patients with HGD, initial RFA was more effective and less costly than endoscopic surveillance. Among patients with LGD, when S3 was compared with S2, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $18,231/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), assuming an annual rate of progression rate from LGD to EAC of 0.5%/year. For patients without dysplasia, S2 was more effective and less costly than S1.

9835,Cost-effectiveness of nutritional intervention on healing of pressure ulcers,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Pressure ulcers not only affect quality of life among the elderly, but also bring a large economic burden. There is limited evidence available for the effectiveness of nutritional interventions for treatment of pressure ulcers. In Japan, recently, a 60-patient randomized controlled trial of nutritional intervention on pressure ulcers demonstrated improvement in healing of pressure ulcers, compared with conventional management. To evaluate value for money of nutritional intervention on healing of pressure ulcers, cost-effective analysis was carried out using these trial results. METHODS: The analysis was carried out from a societal perspective. As effectiveness measures, pressure ulcer days (PUDs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated. Prevalence of pressure ulcers was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Utility score for pressure ulcers is derived from a cross-sectional survey among health professionals related to pressure ulcers. Costs (e.g., nutritional interventions and management of pressure ulcers) were estimated from trial data during observation and follow-up. Stochastic and qualitative sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of results. RESULTS: For observation (12 weeks) and follow-up (12-week observation plus 4-week follow-up), nutritional intervention reduced PUDs by 9.6 and 16.2 per person, and gained 0.226??10(-2) QALYs and 0.382??10(-2) QALYs per person, respectively. In addition, costs were reduced by $542 and $881 per person, respectively. This means nutritional intervention is dominant (cost savings and greater effectiveness). The sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of these results. CONCLUSION: Economic evaluation of nutritional intervention on healing pressure ulcers from a small randomized controlled trial showed that this intervention is cost saving with health improvement.

9836,Anticoagulation in ambulatory cancer patients with no indication for prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation. A cost-effectiveness analysis from a U.S. perspective,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) occurs frequently in cancer patients and is a major cause of mortality. Although anticoagulation (AC) may have anti-tumour effects, it is recommended in cancer patients only for indications unrelated to these effects. A Markov model was constructed to estimate when prophylactic AC, given during four months of chemotherapy following a new cancer diagnosis, would be economically reasonable in ambulatory cancer patients with no VTE history. Risks and costs of major and minor bleeding, VTE, and death were obtained from the literature, including a 2011 Cochrane review of AC in cancer inpatients with no conventional indication. In the model, AC was low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH), and effects were modeled over a 24-month period. Model outputs were quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In the base case analysis, when prophylactic AC had a two-year relative mortality risk of 0.92, there was a gain of 0.0354 QALY, for an ICER of $90,893/QALY gained, compared with no AC. In sensitivity analyses, AC prophylaxis cost less than $100,000/QALY, if two-year mortality exceeded 75%, or if AC costs were less than $1,076 per month, or if LMWH relative mortality risk was less than 0.927. Results were not sensitive to variation in VTE relative risk on AC, nor to major or minor bleeding risk on AC. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis also favoured prophylactic AC.

9837,A model of cost-effectiveness of tissue plasminogen activator in patient subgroups 3 to 4.5 hours after onset of acute ischemic stroke,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: The European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study III (ECASS III) showed that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) administered 3 to 4.5 hours after acute ischemic stroke led to improvement in patient disability versus placebo. We evaluate the long-term incremental cost-effectiveness of rtPA administered 3 to 4.5 hours after acute ischemic stroke onset versus no treatment according to patient clinical and demographic factors. METHODS: We developed a disease-based decision analytic model to project lifetime outcomes of patients post-acute ischemic stroke from the payer perspective. Clinical data were derived from the ECASS III trial, longitudinal cohort studies, and health state preference studies. Cost data were based on Medicare reimbursement and other published sources. We performed probabilistic sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the analysis. RESULTS: rtPA in a hypothetical cohort resulted in a gain of 0.07 years of life (95% credible range 0.0005 to 0.17) and 0.24 quality-adjusted life-years (95% credible range 0.01 to 0.60) and a difference in cost of $1,495 (95% credible range -$4,637 to $6,100) compared with placebo. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for all patients was $6,255 per quality-adjusted life-year gained; for patients younger than 65 years, cost saving; for patients aged 65 years or older, $35,813 per quality-adjusted life-year; for patients with baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 0 to 9, $16,322 per quality-adjusted life-year; for patients with NIHSS score 10 to 19, $37,462 per quality-adjusted life-year; and for patients with NIHSS score greater than or equal to 20, $2,432 per quality-adjusted life-year. The majority of other subgroups such as sex, history of stroke, and history of hypertension were either cost saving or cost-effective, with the exceptions of diabetes and atrial fibrillation.

9842,The economic benefit of hip replacement: a 5-year follow-up of costs and outcomes in the Exeter Primary Outcomes Study,"OBJECTIVES: To assess changes in quality of life and costs of patients undergoing primary total hip replacement using the Exeter prosthesis compared with a hypothetical 'no surgery' group. DESIGN: The incremental quality of life, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost of Exeter Primary Outcomes Study patients was compared with hypothetical 'no surgery' group over 5 years. Scores from annual SF-36 assessments were converted into utility scores using an established algorithm and the QALY gains calculated from pre-operative baseline scores. Costs included implant costs and length of stay. SETTING: Secondary care hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients receiving a primary Exeter implant enrolled in five of seven Exeter Primary Outcomes Study centres. RESULTS: On average, patients gained around 0.8 QALYs over 5 years. Younger and male patients or those with lower body mass index and poorer Oxford Hip Scores were significantly associated with increased QALYs. Treatment costs for a primary episode of care were just over ?5000 (95% CI ?4588 to ?5812) per patient. Compared with 'no surgery', the cost per QALY was ?7182 (95% CI ?6470 to ?7678), and this remained stable when key cost parameters were varied. The most likely cost per QALY was between ?7058 and ?7220. Older patients (age 75+) cost more, mainly due to longer average hospital stays and had a higher cost per QALY, although this remained below ?10?000. CONCLUSIONS: 85% of cases had a cost of <?20?000 per QALY (with 70% having a cost per QALY under ?10?000) compared with no surgery. Cases would be considered cost-effective under currently accepted thresholds (?25?000-?30?000) compared with 'no surgery'. However, depending on age and severity, younger patients and more severe patients had below average cost per QALYs.

9848,The economic benefit of hip replacement: a 5-year follow-up of costs and outcomes in the Exeter Primary Outcomes Study,"OBJECTIVES: To assess changes in quality of life and costs of patients undergoing primary total hip replacement using the Exeter prosthesis compared with a hypothetical 'no surgery' group. DESIGN: The incremental quality of life, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost of Exeter Primary Outcomes Study patients was compared with hypothetical 'no surgery' group over 5 years. Scores from annual SF-36 assessments were converted into utility scores using an established algorithm and the QALY gains calculated from pre-operative baseline scores. Costs included implant costs and length of stay. SETTING: Secondary care hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients receiving a primary Exeter implant enrolled in five of seven Exeter Primary Outcomes Study centres. RESULTS: On average, patients gained around 0.8 QALYs over 5 years. Younger and male patients or those with lower body mass index and poorer Oxford Hip Scores were significantly associated with increased QALYs. Treatment costs for a primary episode of care were just over ?5000 (95% CI ?4588 to ?5812) per patient. Compared with 'no surgery', the cost per QALY was ?7182 (95% CI ?6470 to ?7678), and this remained stable when key cost parameters were varied.

9849,Cost-effectiveness of nutritional intervention in elderly subjects after hip fracture. A randomized controlled trial,"Hip fracture patients can benefit from nutritional supplementation during their recovery. Up to now, cost-effectiveness evaluation of nutritional intervention in these patients has not been performed. Costs of nutritional intervention are relatively low as compared with medical costs. Cost-effectiveness evaluation shows that nutritional intervention is likely to be cost-effective. INTRODUCTION: Previous research on the effect of nutritional intervention on clinical outcome in hip fracture patients yielded contradictory results. Cost-effectiveness of nutritional intervention in these patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate cost-effectiveness of nutritional intervention in elderly subjects after hip fracture from a societal perspective. METHODS: Open-label, multi-centre randomized controlled trial investigating cost-effectiveness of intensive nutritional intervention comprising regular dietetic counseling and oral nutritional supplementation for 3 months postoperatively. Patients allocated to the control group received care as usual. Costs, weight and quality of life were measured at baseline and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for weight at 3 months and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: Of 152 patients enrolled, 73 were randomized to the intervention group and 79 to the control group. Mean costs of the nutritional intervention was 613 Euro. Total costs and subcategories of costs were not significantly different between both groups. Based on bootstrapping of ICERs, the nutritional intervention was likely to be cost-effective for weight as outcome over the 3-month intervention period, regardless of nutritional status at baseline. With QALYs as outcome, the probability for the nutritional intervention being cost-effective was relatively low, except in subjects aged below 75 years. CONCLUSION: Intensive nutritional intervention in elderly hip fracture patients is likely to be cost-effective for weight but not for QALYs. Future cost-effectiveness studies should incorporate outcome measures appropriate for elderly patients, such as functional limitations and other relevant outcome parameters for elderly.",2012-01-09159,22638708,Osteoporos Int,C E Wyers,2013,24 / 1,,No,22638708,"C E Wyers; P L M Reijven; S M A A Evers; P C Willems; I C Heyligers; A D Verburg; S van Helden; P C Dagnelie; Cost-effectiveness of nutritional intervention in elderly subjects after hip fracture.

9850,Cost-effectiveness of open vs endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm: Results of a multicenter randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the costs and comparative cost-effectiveness of two methods of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair in the Open Versus Endovascular Repair (OVER) Veterans Affairs (VA) Cooperative Study, a multicenter randomized trial of 881 patients. METHODS: The primary outcomes of this analysis were mean total health care cost per life-year and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from randomization to 2 years after. QALYs were calculated from EuroQol (EQ)-5D questionnaires collected at baseline and annually. Health care utilization data were obtained directly from patients and from national VA and Medicare data sources. VA costs were obtained from national VA sources using methods previously developed by the VA Health Economics Resource Center. Costs for non-VA care were determined from Medicare claims data or billing data from the patient's health care providers. RESULTS: After 2 years of follow-up, mean life-years were 1.78 in the endovascular repair group and 1.74 in the open repair group (difference, 0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.03 to 0.09; P = .29). Mean QALYs were 1.462 in the endovascular group and 1.461 in the open group (difference adjusting for baseline EQ-5D score, 0.006; 95% CI, -0.038 to 0.052; P = .78). Mean graft costs were higher in the endovascular group ($14,052 vs $1363; P < .001), but length of stay was shorter (5.0 vs 10.5 days; P < .001), resulting in a lower mean cost of the hospital admission for the AAA procedure in the endovascular repair group of $37,068 vs $42,970 (difference, -$5901; 95% CI, -$12,135 to -$821; P = .04). After 2 years, total health care costs remained lower in the endovascular group, but the difference was no longer significant (-$5019; 95% CI, -$16,720 to $4928; P = .35). The probability of endovascular repair being less costly and more effective was 70.9% for life-years and 51.4% for QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: In this multicenter randomized trial, endovascular AAA repair resulted in lower cost and better survival than open repair after the initial hospitalization for repair; but after 2 years, survival, quality of life, and costs were not significantly different between the two treatments.",2012-01-09161,22640466,J Vasc Surg,Kevin T Stroupe,2012,56 / 4,,No,22640466,"Kevin T Stroupe; Frank A Lederle; Jon S Matsumura; Tassos C Kyriakides; Yvonne C Jonk; Ling Ge; Julie A Freischlag; Open Versus Endovascular Repair; Cost-effectiveness of open vs endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm: Results of a multicenter randomized trial, J Vasc Surg, ; 56(4):0741-5214",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) vs. Open repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-851500,United States,2008,-1023569.42
9851,Cost-Effectiveness of Everolimus- Versus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents for Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization (from the SPIRIT-IV Trial),"Although several drug-eluting stents (DESs) have been shown to be economically attractive compared to bare-metal stents in patients at moderate to high risk of restenosis, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of alternative DES designs, especially second-generation DESs. We therefore performed an economic substudy alongside the SPIRIT-IV trial, in which 3,687 patients undergoing single or multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to receive second-generation everolimus-eluting stents (EESs; n = 2,458) or first-generation paclitaxel-eluting stents (PESs; n = 1,229). Costs through 2 years of follow-up were assessed from the perspective of the United States health care system. The primary cost-effectiveness end point was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio assessed as cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. Over a 2-year period, use of EESs versus PESs led to a trend toward decreased overall repeat revascularization procedures (14.2 vs 16.2 per 100 subjects, p = 0.20) driven by a significant decrease in the number of target vessel revascularization procedures (8.2 vs 11.0 per 100 subjects, p = 0.02) but also a slight increase in the number of nontarget vessel revascularization procedures (6.0 vs 5.1 per 100 subjects, p = 0.37). Follow-up cardiovascular costs were decreased by $273/patient in the EES group (95% confidence interval for difference 1,048 less to 502 more, p = 0.49). Formal cost-effectiveness analysis based on these results demonstrated that the probability that EES was an economically attractive strategy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50,000/quality-adjusted life year gained) was 85.7%. These findings demonstrate that in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with DESs, use of EESs is economically attractive compared to PESs with improved clinical outcomes and lower overall medical care costs at 2 years.",2012-01-09178,22651880,Am J Cardiol,Amit P Amin,2012,110 / 6,,No,22651880,"Amit P Amin; Matthew R Reynolds; Yang Lei; Elizabeth A Magnuson; Katherine Vilain; Amy J Durtschi; Charles A Simonton; Gregg W Stone; David J Cohen; Cost-Effectiveness of Everolimus- Versus Paclitaxel-Eluting Stents for Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Revascularization (from the SPIRIT-IV Trial), Am J Cardiol, Sep/15/2012; 110(6):0002-9149",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Everolimus-eluting stents (EESs) vs. Paclitaxel-eluting stents (PESs),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-42656.25,United States,2010,-50628.77
9852,Cost-Effectiveness of Rivaroxaban Compared to Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation,"Rivaroxaban has been found to be noninferior to warfarin for preventing stroke or systemic embolism in patients with high-risk atrial fibrillation (AF) and is associated with a lower rate of intracranial hemorrhage. To assess the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared to adjusted-dose warfarin for the prevention of stroke in patients with AF, we built a Markov model using a United States payer/Medicare perspective and a lifetime time horizon. The base-case analysis assumed a cohort of patients with AF 65 years of age with a congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes, stroke (2 points) score of 3 and no contraindications to anticoagulation. Data sources included the Rivaroxaban Once-daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared with Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation (ROCKET-AF) and other studies of anticoagulation. Outcome measurements included costs in 2011 United States dollars, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Patients with AF treated with rivaroxaban lived an average of 10.03 QALYs at a lifetime treatment cost of $94,456. Those receiving warfarin lived an average of 9.81 QALYs and incurred costs of $88,544. The ICER for rivaroxaban was $27,498 per QALY. These results were most sensitive to changes in the hazard decrease of intracranial hemorrhage and stroke with rivaroxaban, cost of rivaroxaban, and time horizon. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated rivaroxaban was cost-effective in 80% and 91% of 10,000 iterations at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY, respectively. In conclusion, this Markov model suggests that rivaroxaban therapy may be a cost-effective alternative to adjusted-dose warfarin for stroke prevention in AF.",2012-01-09179,22651881,Am J Cardiol,Soyon Lee,2012,110 / 6,,No,22651881,"Soyon Lee; Moise W Anglade; Dan Pham; Robyn Pisacane; Jeffrey Kluger; Craig I Coleman; Cost-Effectiveness of Rivaroxaban Compared to Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation, Am J Cardiol, Sep/15/2012; 110(6):0002-9149",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rivaroxaban (20 mg 1 times/day) vs. Dose adjusted warfarin,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,27498,United States,2011,31638.73
9853,Economic modelling assessment of the HPV quadrivalent vaccine in Brazil: A dynamic individual-based approach,"We examined the cost-effectiveness of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine for the pre-adolescent female population of Brazil. Using demographic, epidemiological and cancer data, we developed a dynamic individual-based model representing the natural history of HPV/cervical cancer as well as the impact of screening and vaccination programmes. Assuming the current screening strategies, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for cohorts with and without vaccination taking into account different combinations of vaccination coverage (50%, 70%, 90%) and cost per vaccinated woman (US$25, US$55, US$125, US$556). The results varied from cost-saving (coverage 50% or 70% and cost per vaccinated woman US$25) to 5950US$/QALY (coverage 90% and cost per vaccinated 556US$). In a scenario in which a booster shot was needed after 10years in order to secure lifelong protection, the ICER resulted in 13,576US$/QALY. Considering the very cost-effective and cost-effective thresholds based on Brazil's GDP per capita, apart from the booster scenario which would be deemed cost-effective, all the other scenarios would be deemed very cost-effective. Both the cost per dose of vaccine and discount rate (5%) had an important impact on the results. Vaccination in addition to the current screening programme is likely to save years of life and, depending on the cost of vaccination, may even save resources. Price negotiations between governments and manufacturers will be paramount in determining that the vaccine not only represents good value for money, but is also affordable in middle-income countries like Brazil.",2012-01-09182,22652405,Vaccine,Tazio Vanni,2012,30 / 32,,Yes,22652405,"Tazio Vanni; Paula Mendes Luz; Anna Foss; Marco Mesa-Frias; Rosa Legood; Economic modelling assessment of the HPV quadrivalent vaccine in Brazil: A dynamic individual-based approach, Vaccine, Jul/6/2012; 30(32):1873-2518",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,11 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,2008,Not Stated
9854,Is it time for a change? A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing a multidisciplinary integrated care model for residential homes to usual care,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a Multidisciplinary Integrated Care (MIC) model compared to Usual Care (UC) in Dutch residential homes.The economic evaluation was conducted from a societal perspective alongside a 6 month, clustered, randomized controlled trial involving 10 Dutch residential homes. Outcome measures included a quality of care weighted sum score, functional health (COOP WONCA) and Quality Adjusted Life-Years (QALY). Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation. Bootstrapping was used to analyze differences in costs and cost-effectiveness.The quality of care sum score in MIC was significantly higher than in UC. The other primary outcomes showed no significant differences between the MIC and UC. The costs of providing MIC were approximately ?225 per patient. Total costs were ?2,061 in the MIC group and ?1,656 for the UC group (mean difference ?405, 95% -13; 826). The probability that the MIC was cost-effective in comparison with UC was 0.95 or more for ceiling ratios larger than ?129 regarding patient related quality of care. Cost-effectiveness planes showed that the MIC model was not cost-effective compared to UC for the other outcomes.Clinical effect differences between the groups were small but quality of care was significantly improved in the MIC group.

Methods: A decision analytic Markov model of interventions designed to prevent falls was developed.

Uncertainty was explored using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Conclusion: In the general population, compared with no intervention the ICERs were tai chi ($44,205), group-based exercise ($70,834), multiple interventions ($72,306), home exercise ($93,432), multifactorial interventions with only referral ($125,868) and multifactorial interventions with an active component ($165,841). The interventions were ranked by cost in order to exclude dominated interventions (more costly, less effective) and extendedly dominated interventions (where an intervention is more costly and less effective than a combination of two other interventions).

9868,Influence of patient preferences on the cost-effectiveness of screening for lynch syndrome,"Purpose: Patients and relatives have varying preferences for genetic testing and interventions related to hereditary cancer syndromes. We examined how the impact of these services on quality of life (QoL) affects the cost-effectiveness of screening for Lynch syndrome among probands newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer and their relatives. Methods: We constructed a state-transition model comparing screening strategies (clinical criteria, prediction algorithms, tumor testing, and upfront germline testing) with no screening to identify Lynch syndrome. The model incorporated individuals' health state utilities after screening, germline testing, and risk-reducing surgeries, with utilities persisting for 12 months in the base case. Outcomes consisted of quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALYs), costs, and cost per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses assessed how the duration and magnitude of changes in QoL influenced results. Results: Multiple screening strategies yielded gains in QALYs at acceptable costs compared with no screening. The preferred strategy-immunohistochemistry of tumors followed by BRAF mutation testing (IHC/BRAF)-cost $59,700 per QALY gained in the base case. The duration and magnitude of decreases in QoL after decisions related to germline testing and surgeries were key determinants of the cost-effectiveness of screening. IHC/BRAF cost >$100,000 per QALY gained when decrements to QoL persisted for 21 months.

9877,Cost-effectiveness analysis of SBRT versus IMRT: an emerging initial radiation treatment option for organ-confined prostate cancer,"Objectives: The purpose of this study is to compare the cost-effectiveness of 2 external beam radiation therapy techniques for treatment of lowto intermediate-risk prostate cancer: stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and intensitymodulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Materials and Methods: A Markov decision analysis model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis was designed with the various disease states of a 70-year-old patient with organ-confined prostate cancer to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 2 external beam radiation treatment options. Results: The Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the mean cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for SBRT and IMRT were $22,152 and 7.9 years and $35,431 and 7.9 years, respectively. The sensitivity analysis revealed that if the SBRT cohort experienced a decrease in quality of life of 4% or a decrease in efficacy of 6%, then SBRT would no longer dominate IMRT in cost-effectiveness. In fact, with these relaxed assumptions for SBRT, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of IMRT met the societal willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY. Conclusions: Compared with IMRT, SBRT for lowto intermediate-risk prostate cancer has great potential cost savings for our healthcare system payers and may improve access to radiation, increase patient convenience, and boost quality of life for patients. Our model suggests that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of IMRT compared with SBRT is highly sensitive to quality-oflife outcomes, which should be adequately and comparably measured in current and future prostate SBRT studies.",2012-01-09201,22694113,Am J Manag Care,Joseph C Hodges,2012,18 / 5,e186-93,No,22694113,"Joseph C Hodges; Yair Lotan; Thomas P Boike; Rhonda Benton; Alyson Barrier; Robert D Timmerman; Cost-effectiveness analysis of SBRT versus IMRT: an emerging initial radiation treatment option for organ-confined prostate cancer, Am J Manag Care, ; 18(5):1096-1860; e186-93",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Stereotactic beam radiation therapy (SBRT) vs. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT),Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2010,Not Stated
9878,Is it beneficial to increase the provision of thrombolysis?-- a discrete-event simulation model,"Although Thrombolysis has been licensed in the UK since 2003, it is still administered only to a small percentage of eligible patients.We consider the impact of investing the impact of thrombolysis on important acute stroke services, and the effect on quality of life. The concept is illustrated using data from the Northern Ireland Stroke Service. Design: Retrospective study.We first present results of survival analysis utilizing length of stay (LOS) for discharge destinations, based on data from the Belfast City Hospital (BCH). None of these patients actually received thrombolysis but from those who would have been eligible, we created two initial groups, the first representing a scenario where they received thrombolysis and the second comprising those who do not receive thrombolysis. On the basis of the survival analysis, we created several subgroups based on discharge destination. We then developed a discrete event simulation (DES) model, where each group is a patient pathway within the simulation. Coxian phase type distributions were used to model the group LOS. Various scenarios were explored focusing on cost-effectiveness across hospital, community and social services had thrombolysis been administered to these patients, and the possible improvement in quality of life, should the proportion of patients who are administered thrombolysis be increased. Our aim in simulating various scenarios for this historical group of patients is to assess what the cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis would have been under different scenarios; from this we can infer the likely cost-effectiveness of future policies.The cost of thrombolysis is offset by reduction in hospital, community rehabilitation and institutional care costs, with a corresponding improvement in quality of life.Our model suggests that provision of thrombolysis would produce moderate overall improvement to the service assuming current levels of funding.",2012-01-09238,22383688,QJM,M Barton,2012,105 / 7,665-73,No,22383688,"M Barton; S McClean; J Gillespie; L Garg; D Wilson; K Fullerton; Is it beneficial to increase the provision of thrombolysis?-- a discrete-event simulation model, QJM, ; 105(7):1460-2725; 665-73",QALY,Ireland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treating 50% of eligible patients with thrombolysis vs. Standard of care- treating 10% of eligible patients with thrombolysis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.50,3.50,-3393.94,United Kingdom,2008,-7565.87

The overall cost of the program that distributed 200,000 female condoms and provided educational services was $414,186 (at a total gross cost per condom used during sex of $3.19, including educational services). The number of HIV infections that would have to be averted in order for the program to be cost-saving was 1.13 in the societal perspective and 1.50 in the public sector payor perspective. The cost-effectiveness threshold of HIV infections to be averted was 0.46.

9880,Eltrombopag for the treatment of chronic immune or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: a NICE single technology appraisal,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of eltrombopag (GlaxoSmithKline) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of this drug for the treatment of patients with chronic immune or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), as part of the their Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process. The Aberdeen Technology Assessment Review (TAR) Group, commissioned to act as the evidence review group (ERG), critically reviewed and supplemented the submitted evidence. This paper describes the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. The ERG critically appraised the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence submitted by the manufacturer, independently searched for relevant literature, conducted a critical appraisal of the submitted economic models and explored the impact of altering some of the key model assumptions as well as combining relevant sensitivity analyses. Three trials were used to inform the safety and efficacy aspects of this submission; however, one high-quality randomized controlled trial (RAISE study) was the principal source of evidence and was used to inform the economic model. Eltrombopag had greater odds of achieving the primary outcome of a platelet count between 50???10^?/L and 400???10^?/L during the 6-month treatment period than placebo (odds ratio [OR] 8.2, 99% CI 3.6, 18.7). In the eltrombopag group, 50/83 (60%) of non-splenectomized patients and 18/49 (37%) of splenectomized patients achieved this outcome. The median duration of response was 10.9 weeks for eltrombopag (splenectomized 6 and non-splenectomized 13.4) compared with 0 for placebo. Eltrombopag patients required less rescue medication and had lower odds of bleeding events for both the splenectomized and the non-splenectomized patients. For a watch-and-rescue strategy of care, the comparator was placebo and the ERG found that substantial reductions in the cost of eltrombopag are needed before the incremental cost per QALY is less than ?30,000. There was significant uncertainty, with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) reported varying from ?33,561 to ?103,500 per QALY (splenectomized) and ?39,657 to ?150,245 per QALY (non-splenectomized). All costs are presented in ?, year 2008 values, as this was the costing year for the manufacturer's model. Other than bleeding, no adverse events were modelled. In relation to the long-term treatment model, the ERG questioned the robustness of the use of non-randomized non-comparative data. The base-case results restricting the time horizon to 2 years and prescribing eltrombopag as second-line treatment post-rituximab were found to be favourable towards eltrombopag. As rituximab is not a licensed treatment for ITP, the ERG were concerned that its inclusion may not be reflective of clinical practice. None of the treatment sequences resulted in an ICER approaching the recommended threshold of ?30,000 per QALY gained. Eltrombopag appears to be a safe treatment for ITP (although long-term follow-up studies are awaited) and has short-term efficacy.

ART costs were referenced to current (2011) pricing guidelines in the UK. Medical care costs reflected UK treatment patterns and relevant drug pricing. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per year. Costs are expressed in British pounds (?) and life expectancy in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).In the ART-na?ve subjects, the model predicted a marginal improved life expectancy of 0.031 QALYs (11 days) for the ATV+RTV regimen as a result of predicted CHD outcomes based on lower increases in cholesterol levels compared with the LPV/r regimen. The model demonstrated cost savings with the LPV/r regimen. The total lifetime cost savings was ?4070 per patient for the LPV/r regimen. LPV/r saved ?2133 and ?3409 per patient at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Referenced to LPV/r, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ATV+RTV was ?149,270/QALY. For ART-experienced patients VL suppression differences favored LPV/r, while CHD risk associated with elevated total cholesterol marginally favored ATV+RTV, resulting in a net improvement in life expectancy of 0.31 QALYs (106 days) for LPV/r.

9884,Cost-effectiveness of rituximab as maintenance therapy in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma after responding to first-line rituximab plus chemotherapy,"A recent phase III trial demonstrated that maintenance rituximab? therapy after response to first-line treatment with rituximab plus chemotherapy (R-chemo) increases progression-free survival (PFS) for follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma (f-NHL). A cost-effectiveness analysis of R-maintenance versus observation was conducted from a US payer perspective to estimate PFS and overall survival (OS) over a representative patient's lifetime. Primary outcomes were cost per life-year gained (LYG) and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with observation, R-maintenance increased mean PFS by 1.50 years, OS by 1.21 years and QALYs gained by 1.11 years. The incremental cost of maintenance therapy was $38 545. The costs per LYG and QALY gained were $31 934 and $34 842, respectively. Within the limitations of modeling long-term outcomes, R-maintenance therapy in patients who received R-chemo for previously untreated f-NHL compared with observation alone after R-chemo for first-line treatment for f-NHL is cost-effective from the US payer perspective.",2012-01-09267,22591119,Leuk Lymphoma,John Hornberger,2012,53 / 12,2371-7,No,22591119,"John Hornberger; Rebecca Chien; Mark Friedmann; Leona Han; Ashwini Shewade; Sacha Satram-Hoang; Carolina Reyes; Cost-effectiveness of rituximab as maintenance therapy in patients with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma after responding to first-line rituximab plus chemotherapy, Leuk Lymphoma, ; 53(12):1042-8194; 2371-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Maintenance rituximab therapy vs. Obervation,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,34842,United States,2010,41354.02
9885,Cost effectiveness of quetiapine in patients with acute bipolar depression and in maintenance treatment after an acute depressive episode,"Bipolar disorder has a significant impact upon a patient's quality of life, imposing a considerable economic burden on the individual, family members and society as a whole. Several medications are indicated for the acute treatment of mania and depression associated with bipolar disorder as well as for maintenance therapy; however, these have varying efficacy, tolerability and costs. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a new discrete-event simulation model to analyse the long-term consequences of pharmacological therapy for the management of bipolar I and II disorders (acute treatment of episodes of mania and depression as well as maintenance therapy).Probabilities of remission and relapse were obtained from clinical trial data and meta-analyses. Costs (year 2011 values) were assessed from a UK healthcare payer's perspective, and included pharmacological therapy and resource use associated with the treatment of mood events and selected adverse events. The health effects were measured in terms of QALYs.For a patient starting with acute depression or in remission at 40 years of age (which was the average age in the clinical trials), quetiapine 300?mg/day was a cost-effective strategy compared with olanzapine 15?mg/day over a 5-year time frame. With acute bipolar depression as a starting episode, the 5-year medical costs were ?323 higher and QALYs were 0.038 higher for quetiapine compared with olanzapine, corresponding to a cost-effectiveness ratio of ?8600 per QALY gained.Compared with olanzapine, the results suggest that quetiapine is cost effective as a maintenance treatment for bipolar depression.",2012-01-09268,22591130,Pharmacoeconomics,Mattias Ekman,2012,30 / 2,513-30,Yes,22591130,"Mattias Ekman; Peter Lindgren; Carolin Miltenburger; Genevieve Meier; Julie C Locklear; Mary Lou Chatterton; Cost effectiveness of quetiapine in patients with acute bipolar depression and in maintenance treatment after an acute depressive episode, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 30(2):1179-2027; 513-30",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Quetiapine (300mg/day) for mania, depression and maintenance vs. Olanzapine (15mg/day) for mania, depression and maintenance",Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,8591,United Kingdom,2011,15857.98

9895,"Costs, consequences and feasibility of strategies for achieving the goals of the National HIV/AIDS strategy in the United States: a closing window for success?","Three key policy questions are explored here: Is it still epidemiologically feasible to attain the incidence and transmission rate reduction goals of the U.S. National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) by 2015? If so, what costs will be incurred in necessary program expansion, and will the investment be cost-effective? Would substantial expansion of prevention services for persons living with HIV (PLWH) augment the other strategies outlined in the NHAS in terms of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness? Eight policy scenarios were constructed based on three factors (two levels each): expansion (or not) of HIV diagnostic services; assumptions regarding levels of effectiveness of HIV treatment in achieving suppressed viral load; and possible levels of expansion of prevention services for PLWH. All scenarios assumed that the NHAS goal of 85 % linkage to HIV care would be fully achieved by 2015. Standard methods of economic evaluation and epidemiologic modeling were employed.
