12501,Cost effectiveness of a pragmatic exercise intervention (EXIMS) for people with multiple sclerosis: economic evaluation of a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Exercise is a safe, non-pharmacological adjunctive treatment for people with multiple sclerosis but cost-effective approaches to implementing exercise within health care settings are needed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to assess the cost effectiveness of a pragmatic exercise intervention in conjunction with usual care compared to usual care only in people with mild to moderate multiple sclerosis. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial over nine months of follow-up was conducted. A total of 120 people with multiple sclerosis were randomised (1:1) to the intervention or usual care. Exercising participants received 18 supervised and 18 home exercise sessions over 12 weeks. The primary outcome for the cost utility analysis was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, calculated using utilities measured by the EQ-5D questionnaire. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY of the intervention was pound10,137 per QALY gained compared to usual care. The probability of being cost effective at a pound20,000 per QALY threshold was 0.75, rising to 0.78 at a pound30,000 per QALY threshold. CONCLUSION: The pragmatic exercise intervention is highly likely to be cost effective at current established thresholds, and there is scope for it to be tailored to particular sub-groups of patients or services to reduce its cost impact.",2014-01-15001,24421304,Mult Scler,J Tosh,2014,20 / 8,1123-1130,No,24421304,"J Tosh; S Dixon; A Carter; A Daley; J Petty; A Roalfe; B Sharrack; Jm Saxton; Cost effectiveness of a pragmatic exercise intervention (EXIMS) for people with multiple sclerosis: economic evaluation of a randomised controlled trial, Mult Scler, ; 20(8):1352-4585; 1123-1130",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,2 supervised exercise sessions/week for 6 weeks and 2 self-directed exercise session/week at home for 6 weeks vs. None,Not Stated,44 Years,38 Years,"Female, Male",Full,9 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,28600,United Kingdom,2011,52792.24
12502,Cost-effectiveness of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) for patients with advanced heart failure: analysis of the British NHS bridge to transplant (BTT) program,"BACKGROUND: A previous cost-effectiveness analysis showed that bridge to transplant (BTT) with early design left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) for advanced heart failure was more expensive than medical management while appearing less beneficial. Older LVADs were pulsatile, but current second and third generation LVADs are continuous flow pumps. This study aimed to estimate comparative cost-effectiveness of BTT with durable implantable continuous flow LVADs compared to medical management in the British NHS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A semi-Markov multi-state economic model was built using NHS costs data and patient data in the British NHS Blood and Transplant Database (BTDB). Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental costs per QALY were calculated for patients receiving LVADs compared to those receiving inotrope supported medical management. LVADs cost pound80,569 ($127,887) at 2011 prices and delivered greater benefit than medical management. The estimated probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound53,527 ($84,963)/QALY (95%CI: pound31,802- pound94,853; $50,479-$150,560) (over a lifetime horizon). Estimates were sensitive to choice of comparator population, relative likelihood of receiving a heart transplant, time to transplant, and LVAD costs. Reducing the device cost by 15% decreased the ICER to pound50,106 ($79,533)/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Durable implantable continuous flow LVADs deliver greater benefits at higher costs than medical management in Britain. At the current UK threshold of pound20,000 to pound30,000/QALY LVADs are not cost effective but the ICER now begins to approach that of an intervention for end of life care recently recommended by the British NHS.

This study aimed to evaluate the comparative and cost-effectiveness of staged laboratory-based and non-laboratory-based total CVD risk assessment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used receiver operating characteristic curve and cost-effectiveness modeling methods to compare strategies with and without laboratory components and used single-stage and multistage algorithms, including approaches based on Framingham risk scores (laboratory-based assessments for all individuals). Analyses were conducted using data from 5998 adults in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey without history of CVD using 10-year CVD death as the main outcome. A microsimulation model projected lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for 60 Framingham-based, non-laboratory-based, and staged screening approaches. Across strategies, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.774 to 0.780 in men and 0.812 to 0.834 in women. There were no statistically significant differences in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between multistage and Framingham-based approaches. In cost-effectiveness analyses, multistage strategies had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $52,000/QALY and $83,000/QALY for men and women, respectively.

12512,"Who needs laboratories and who needs statins?: comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses of non-laboratory-based, laboratory-based, and staged primary cardiovascular disease screening guidelines","BACKGROUND: Early detection and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors produces significant clinical benefits, but no consensus exists on optimal screening algorithms. This study aimed to evaluate the comparative and cost-effectiveness of staged laboratory-based and non-laboratory-based total CVD risk assessment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used receiver operating characteristic curve and cost-effectiveness modeling methods to compare strategies with and without laboratory components and used single-stage and multistage algorithms, including approaches based on Framingham risk scores (laboratory-based assessments for all individuals). Analyses were conducted using data from 5998 adults in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey without history of CVD using 10-year CVD death as the main outcome. A microsimulation model projected lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for 60 Framingham-based, non-laboratory-based, and staged screening approaches. Across strategies, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.774 to 0.780 in men and 0.812 to 0.834 in women. There were no statistically significant differences in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between multistage and Framingham-based approaches. In cost-effectiveness analyses, multistage strategies had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $52,000/QALY and $83,000/QALY for men and women, respectively. Single-stage/Framingham-based strategies were dominated (higher cost and lower QALYs) or had unattractive incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (>$300,000/QALY) compared with single-stage/non-laboratory-based and multistage approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Non-laboratory-based CVD risk assessment can be useful in primary CVD prevention as a substitute for laboratory-based assessments or as the initial component of a multistage approach.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The effectiveness and costs of optimal use of hospital-based AMI treatments were estimated by the CHD Policy Model-China, a Markov-style computer simulation model. Changes in simulated AMI, CHD mortality, quality-adjusted life years, and total healthcare costs were the outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was used to assess projected cost-effectiveness. Optimal use of 4 oral drugs (aspirin, beta-blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) in all eligible patients with AMI or unfractionated heparin in non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction was a highly cost-effective strategy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios approximately US $3100 or less). Optimal use of reperfusion therapies in eligible patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction was moderately cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio </=$10,700). Optimal use of clopidogrel for all eligible patients with AMI or primary percutaneous coronary intervention among high-risk patients with non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction in tertiary hospitals alone was less cost effective. Use of all the selected hospital-based AMI treatment strategies together would be cost-effective and reduce the total CHD mortality rate in China by approximately 9.6%.

12518,Cost-utility analysis of a randomized controlled weight loss trial among lactating overweight/obese women,"BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity among young, adult women are increasing problems in Sweden as in many other countries. The postpartum period may be a good opportunity to improve eating habits and lose weight in a sustainable manner. The aim was to make a cost-utility analysis of a dietary behavior modification treatment alongside usual care, compared to usual care alone, among lactating overweight and obese women. METHODS: This study was a cost-utility analysis based on a randomized controlled and longitudinal clinical diet intervention. Between 2007-2010, 68 women living in Sweden were, after baseline measurement at 8-12 weeks postpartum, randomly assigned to a 12-week dietary behavior modification treatment or control group. Inclusion criteria were: self-reported pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) 25-35 kg/m2, non-smoker, singleton term delivery, birth weight > 2500 g, intention to breastfeed for 6 mo and no diseases (mother and child). The women in the intervention group received 1.5 hour of individual counseling at study start and 1 hour at follow-up home visits after 6 weeks of intervention, with support through cell phone text messages every two wk. Dietary intervention aimed to reduce dietary intake by 500 kcal/day. The control group received usual care. Weight results have previously been reported. Here we report on analyses carried out during 2012-2013 of cost per quality adjusted life years (QALY), based on the changes in quality of life measured by EQ-5D-3 L and SF-6D. Likelihood of cost-effectiveness was calculated using Net Monetary Benefit method. RESULTS: Based on conservative assumptions of no remaining effect after 1 year follow-up, the diet intervention was cost-effective. Costs per gained QALY were 8 643 - 9 758 USD. The likelihood for cost-effectiveness, considering a willingness to pay 50 000 USD for a QALY, was 87-93%. CONCLUSIONS: The diet intervention is cost-effective.

STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. METHODS: Ninety patients and 52 health professionals served as proxies to estimate the benefit of bilateral cochlear implantation, utilizing the Health Utility Index. Three scenarios were created to reflect 1) deafness without intervention, 2) unilateral CI, and 3) bilateral CI. Cost evaluation reflected the burden on a publicly funded healthcare system. The base case included 25 years of service provision, processor upgrades every 5 years, 50% price reduction for second side, and 15% failure rate. Discounting and sensitivity analyses were applied. RESULTS: Costs were $63,632 (unilateral CI), $111,764 (bilateral CI), and $48,132 (incremental cost of second CI). The health preference gained from no intervention to unilateral CI, and to bilateral CI were 0.270 and 0.305. Incremental utility gained by the second implant was 11.5% of total. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was $14,658/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for bilateral CI compared to no intervention. It was stable regardless of discounting or sensitivity analyses.

12523,Early psychosocial intervention in Alzheimer's disease: cost utility evaluation alongside the Danish Alzheimer's Intervention Study (DAISY),"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost utility of early psychosocial intervention for patients with Alzheimer''s disease and their primary caregivers. DESIGN: Cost utility evaluation alongside a multicentre, randomised controlled trial with 3 years of follow-up. SETTING: Primary care and memory clinics in five Danish districts. PARTICIPANTS: 330 community-dwelling patients and their primary caregivers. INTERVENTION: Psychosocial counselling and support lasting 8-12 months after diagnosis and follow-up at 3, 6, 12 and 36 months in the intervention group or follow-up only in the control group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the cost of additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were measured from a societal perspective, including the costs of healthcare, social care, informal care and production loss. QALYs were estimated separately for the patient and the caregiver before aggregation for the main analysis. RESULTS: None of the observed cost and QALY measures were significantly different between the intervention and control groups, although a tendency was noted for psychosocial care leading to cost increases with informal care that was not outweighed by the tendency for cost savings with formal care. The probability of psychosocial intervention being cost-effective did not exceed 36% for any threshold value. The alternative scenario analysis showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness increased over the range of threshold values used if the cost perspective was restricted to formal healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted, psychosocial intervention programme was found unlikely to be cost-effective from a societal perspective. The recommendation for practice in settings that are similar to the Danish setting is to provide follow-up with referral to available local support programmes when needed, and to restrict large multifaceted intervention programmes to patients and caregivers with special needs until further evidence for cost-effectiveness emerges.

12524,Economic evaluation of access to musculoskeletal care: the case of waiting for total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The projected demand for total knee arthroplasty is staggering. At its root, the solution involves increasing supply or decreasing demand. Other developed nations have used rationing and wait times to distribute this service. However, economic impact and cost-effectiveness of waiting for TKA is unknown. METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed for a cost-utility analysis of three treatment strategies for end-stage knee osteoarthritis: 1) TKA without delay, 2) a waiting period with no non-operative treatment and 3) a non-operative treatment bridge during that waiting period in a cohort of 60 year-old patients. Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from the literature. Costs were estimated from the societal perspective with national average Medicare reimbursement. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Principal outcome measures were average incremental costs, effectiveness, and quality-adjusted life years; and net health benefits. RESULTS: In the base case, a 2-year wait-time both with and without a non-operative treatment bridge resulted in a lower number of average QALYs gained (11.57 (no bridge) and 11.95 (bridge) vs. 12.14 (no delay). The average cost was $1,660 higher for TKA without delay than wait-time with no bridge, but $1,810 less than wait-time with non-operative bridge. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing wait-time with no bridge to TKA without delay was $2,901/QALY. When comparing TKA without delay to waiting with non-operative bridge, TKA without delay produced greater utility at a lower cost to society. CONCLUSIONS: TKA without delay is the preferred cost-effective treatment strategy when compared to a waiting for TKA without non-operative bridge. TKA without delay is cost saving when a non-operative bridge is used during the waiting period. As it is unlikely that patients waiting for TKA would not receive non-operative treatment, TKA without delay may be an overall cost-saving health care delivery strategy. Policies aimed at increasing the supply of TKA should be considered as savings exist that could indirectly fund those strategies.",2014-01-15020,24438051,BMC Musculoskelet Disord,Richard C 3rd Mather,2014,15 /,22,No,24438051,"Richard C 3rd Mather; Kevin T Hug; Lori A Orlando; Tyler Steven Watters; Lane Koenig; Ryan M Nunley; Michael P Bolognesi; Economic evaluation of access to musculoskeletal care: the case of waiting for total knee arthroplasty, BMC Musculoskelet Disord, ; 15():1471-2474; 22",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Total knee anthroplasty without delay vs. Delayed total knee anthroplasty with no treatment bridge,failed non-operative measures outlined by the American Acamdey of Orthopedic Surgeons,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2723,United States,2009,3284.95
12525,The cost-effectiveness of a pharmacogenetic test: a trial-based evaluation of TPMT genotyping for azathioprine,"BACKGROUND: Thiopurine-methyl transferase (TPMT) testing prior to the prescription of azathioprine in autoimmune diseases is one of the few examples of a pharmacogenetic test that has made the transition from research into clinical practice. TPMT testing could lead to improved prescribing of azathioprine resulting in a reduction in adverse drug reactions as well as an improvement in effectiveness. When allocating scarce resources robust evidence on cost-effectiveness is required. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a TPMT genotyping test to inform azathioprine prescribing in autoimmune diseases. The secondary aim of this study was to demonstrate the complexity of undertaking a trial-based evaluation of a pharmacogenetic test. METHODS: A prospective economic evaluation was conducted alongside the TARGET (TPMT: Azathioprine Response to Genotype and Enzyme Testing) study, a pragmatic controlled trial that randomized (1:1) patients to undergo TPMT genotyping before azathioprine (n = 167) or current practice (n = 166). Assuming the UK health service perspective and a time horizon of 4 months, resource-use and health status data were collected prospectively for all recruited patients. RESULTS: The mean incremental cost for TPMT genotyping and subsequent care pathways compared with current practice for the 4-month follow-up was - pound421.06 (95% confidence interval - pound925.15 to pound89.75). Mean incremental quality-adjusted life-years were close to zero but negative: -0.008 (95% confidence interval -0.017 to 0.0002). Assuming a threshold of pound20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the expected incremental net benefit of introducing the test is pound256.89 (95% CI - pound425.94 to pound932.86). CONCLUSIONS: TPMT genotyping potentially offers a less expensive alternative than current practice, but it may also have a small but negative effect on health status. These findings are associated with significant uncertainty, and the causal effect of TPMT genotyping on changes in health status and health care resource use remains uncertain. The results from this study therefore pose a difficult challenge to decision makers.",2014-01-15021,24438714,Value Health,Alexander J Thompson,2014,17 / 1,22-33,Yes,24438714,"Alexander J Thompson; William G Newman; Rachel A Elliott; Stephen A Roberts; Karen Tricker; Katherine Payne; The cost-effectiveness of a pharmacogenetic test: a trial-based evaluation of TPMT genotyping for azathioprine, Value Health, ; 17(1):1098-3015; 22-33",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Thiopurine-methyl transferase test prior to azathioprine prescription vs. Standard/Usual Care- No genetic testing before the stepwise dose escalation of azathioprine up to maintenance dose with routine hematological and biochemical monitoring,Not Stated,Not Stated,16 Years,"Female, Male",Full,4 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,22835.62,United Kingdom,2009,39887.8

METHODS: A propensity score-matched cohort of 6856 elderly (>/=65 years) ovarian cancer patients diagnosed from 1991 to 2005 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data cohort were included. Treatment regimens (i.e., no chemotherapy, platinum-based only, platinum plus taxane, and other nonplatinum) were identified in the 6 months postdiagnosis. Patients were followed until death or end of study (December 2006). Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total health care costs were measured by using a payer''s perspective (2009 US dollars). Methodological and statistical uncertainties were accounted by including alternative scenarios (for utility values) and net monetary benefit approach. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated, and stratified analyses were performed by tumor stages and age groups. RESULTS: On comparing the platinum-based group versus no chemotherapy, we found that the ICER was $30,073/QALY and $58,151/QALY for early- and late-stage disease, respectively, while other nonplatinum and platinum plus taxane groups were dominated (less effective and more costly). Similar results were found across alternative scenarios and age groups.

12528,Cost-effectiveness of asenapine in the treatment of bipolar disorder in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Bipolar disorder (BPD) is prevalent and is associated with a significant economic burden. Asenapine, the first tetracyclic antipsychotic approved in Canada for the treatment of BPD, has shown a comparable efficacy profile to other atypical antipsychotics. In addition, it is associated with a favourable metabolic profile and minimal weight gain potential. This study aimed to assess the economic impact of asenapine compared to olanzapine in the treatment of BPD in Canada. METHODS: A decision tree combined with a Markov model was constructed to assess the cost-utility of asenapine compared with olanzapine. The decision tree takes into account the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), the probability of switching to a different antipsychotic, and the probability of gaining weight. The Markov model takes into account long-term metabolic complications including diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart diseases (CHDs), and stroke. Analyses were conducted from both a Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH) and a societal perspective over a five-year time horizon with yearly cycles. RESULTS: In the treatment of BPD, asenapine is a dominant strategy over olanzapine from both a MoH and a societal perspective. In fact, asenapine is associated with lower costs and more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that asenapine remains a dominant strategy in 99.2% of the simulations, in both a MoH and a societal perspective, and this result is robust to the many deterministic sensitivity analyses performed. CONCLUSIONS: This economic evaluation demonstrates that asenapine is a cost-effective strategy compared to olanzapine in the treatment of BPD in Canada.",2014-01-15039,24450548,BMC Psychiatry,Jean Lachaine,2014,14 /,16,No,24450548,"Jean Lachaine; Catherine Beauchemin; Karine Mathurin; Dominique Gilbert; Maud Beillat; Cost-effectiveness of asenapine in the treatment of bipolar disorder in Canada, BMC Psychiatry, ; 14():1471-244X; 16",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Asenapine vs. Olanzapine,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 10 years",5.00,5.00,-45262.35,Canada,2011,-52675.12

12535,Prehospital telemedicine electrocardiogram triage for a regional public emergency medical service: is it worth it? A preliminary cost analysis,"BACKGROUND: Telemedicine has been shown to improve quality of health-care delivery in several fields of medicine; its cost-effectiveness, however, is still a matter of debate. HYPOTHESIS: Pre-hospital telemedicine electrocardiogram triage for regional public emergency medical service may reduce costs. METHODS: An economic evaluation (cost analysis) was performed from the perspective of regional health-care system. Patients enrolled in the study and considered for cost analysis were those who called the local emergency medical service (EMS; dialing 1-1-8) during 2012 and underwent prehospital field triage with a telemedicine electrocardiogram (ECG) in the case of suspected acute cardiac disease (acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia). The prehospital ECGs were read by a remote cardiologist, available 24/7. Cost savings associated with this method were calculated by subtracting the cost of prehospital triage with telemedicine support from the cost of conventional emergency department triage (ECG and consultation by a cardiologist). RESULTS: During 2012, the regional EMS performed 109 750 ECGs by telemedicine support. The associated total cost for the regional health-care system was euro1 833 333, with a euro16.70 cost per single ECG/consultation. Given the cost of similar conventional emergency department treatment from a regional rate list of euro24.80 to euro55.20, the savings was euro8.10 to euro38.40 per ECG/consultation (total savings, euro891 759.50 to euro4 219 379.50). The cost for ruling out an acute cardiac disease was euro25.30; for a prehospital diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, euro49.20. With 629 prehospital diagnoses of ST-elevation myocardial infarction and reported reductions in mortality thanks to prehospital diagnosis deduced from prior studies, 69 lives per year presumably could be saved, with a cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of euro1927, euro990/euro - 2508 after correction for potential savings.

12536,Lamivudine compared with newer antivirals for prophylaxis of hepatitis B core antibody positive livers: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"There is concern over the development of de novo hepatitis B in patients receiving liver transplants from hepatitis B surface antigen negative, hepatitis B core antibody positive donors. Current practice is to place such patients on indefinite lamivudine prophylaxis; however, there is a small risk of breakthrough infection and newer antivirals for hepatitis B are available. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of lamivudine compared with the newer agents, tenofovir and entecavir, in the prophylaxis setting using a Markov model. Three strategies were examined which consisted of either lamivudine or entecavir monoprophylaxis with tenofovir add-on therapy after breakthrough or tenofovir monoprophylaxis with emtricitabine add-on therapy after breakthrough. In the base case scenario, lamivudine was the most cost-effective option at a threshold of $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year and this remained robust despite parameter uncertainty.

12538,Cost-effectiveness of adding bevacizumab to first line therapy for patients with advanced ovarian cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of adding bevacizumab to first-line therapy based on outcomes from the GOG-218 and ICON-7 trials. METHODS: A three-state Markov model was used. The time horizon was until the death of 99% of the initial cohort of 1000 individuals. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. All costs were adjusted to 2013 USD. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was reported as incremental cost per QALY gained. The robustness of the result was checked with one-way sensitivity analyses and for relevant clinical situations (i.e. varying the drug of choice to treat cancer recurrence). Subgroup analysis was conducted to identify subgroup of population for whom the strategy could be cost-effective. The potential impact of biosimilar bevacizumab was considered, using a 30% price reduction. RESULTS: For the GOG-218 study protocol, widely followed in US, the addition of bevacizumab results in an ICER of $2,420,691/QALY. For the ICON-7 study protocol, the ICER is $225,515/QALY. The results of the model were sensitive to the quality of life (QoL) and the median progression free survival (PFS). Biosimilar bevacizumab didn''t reduce cost sufficiently to change conclusions. First-line augmentation is cost-effective, with biosimilar bevacizumab, for stage IV patients ($126,169/QALY), ECOG PS1 patients ($116,575/QALY) and for patients with suboptimal residual disease ($122,822/QALY) as per the ICON-7 protocol.

12540,Economic evaluation of brief psychodynamic interpersonal therapy in patients with multisomatoform disorder,BACKGROUND: A brief psychodynamic interpersonal therapy (PIT) in patients with multisomatoform disorder has been recently shown to improve health-related quality of life. AIMS: To assess cost-effectiveness of PIT compared to enhanced medical care in patients with multisomatoform disorder. METHOD: An economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number ISRCTN23215121) conducted in 6 German academic outpatient centres was performed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated from the statutory health insurance perspective on the basis of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained at 12 months. Uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness of PIT was presented by means of a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. RESULTS: Based on the complete-case analysis ICER was 41840 Euro per QALY. The results did not change greatly with the use of multiple imputation (ICER = 44222) and last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach to missing data (ICER = 46663). The probability of PIT being cost-effective exceeded 50% for thresholds of willingness to pay over 35 thousand Euros per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of PIT is highly uncertain for thresholds of willingness to pay under 35 thousand Euros per QALY.,2014-01-15065,24465387,PLoS One,Nadja Chernyak,2014,9 / 1,e83894,No,24465387,"Nadja Chernyak; Heribert Sattel; Marsel Scheer; Christina Baechle; Johannes Kruse; Peter Henningsen; Andrea Icks; Economic evaluation of brief psychodynamic interpersonal therapy in patients with multisomatoform disorder, PLoS One , ; 9(1):1932-6203; e83894",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Psychodynamic-interpersonal psychotherapy vs. Enhanced medical care (3 sessions),Not Stated,77 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,37600,Euro,2012,54501.5
12541,KRAS early testing: consensus initiative and cost-effectiveness evaluation for metastatic colorectal patients in an Italian setting,"KRAS testing is relevant for the choice of the most appropriate first-line therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). Strategies for preventing unequal access to the test should be implemented, but their relevance in the practice is related to economic sustainability. The study adopted the Delphi technique to reach a consensus on several topics. Issues related to execution of KRAS testing were identified by an expert''s board and proposed to 108 Italian oncologists and pathologists through two subsequent questionnaires. The emerging proposal was evaluated by decision analyses models employed by technology assessment agencies in order to assess cost-effectiveness. Alternative therapeutic strategies included most commonly used chemotherapy regimens alone or in combination with cetuximab or bevacizumab. The survey indicated that time interval for obtaining KRAS test should not exceed 15 days, 10 days being an optimal interval. To assure the access to proper treatment, a useful strategy should be to anticipate the test after radical resection in patients at high risk of relapse. Early KRAS testing in high risk CRC patients generates incremental cost-effectiveness ratios between 6,000 and 13,000 Euro per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. In extensive sensitivity analyses ICER''s were always below 15,000 Euro per QALY gained, far within the threshold of 60,000 Euro/QALY gained accepted by regulatory institutions in Italy. In metastatic CRC a time interval higher than 15 days for result of KRAS testing limits access to therapeutic choices. Anticipating KRAS testing before the onset of metastatic disease in patients at high risk does not affect the sustainability and cost-effectiveness profile of cetuximab in first-line mCRC. Early KRAS testing may prevent this inequality in high-risk patients, whether they develop metastases, and is a cost-effective strategy. Based on these results, present joined recommendations of Italian societies of Oncology and Pathology should be updated including early KRAS testing.",2014-01-15066,24465771,PLoS One,Carlo Barone,2014,9 / 1,e85897,No,24465771,"Carlo Barone; Carmine Pinto; Nicola Normanno; Lorenzo Capussotti; Francesco Cognetti; Alfredo Falcone; Lorenzo Mantovani; KRAS early testing: consensus initiative and cost-effectiveness evaluation for metastatic colorectal patients in an Italian setting, PLoS One , ; 9(1):1932-6203; e85897",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early KRAS Mutation testing vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Euro,2012,Not Stated

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness ratios were determined in terms of incremental cost per complete resection (CR) and incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY), based on data collected in the VISIONA observational study. RESULTS: Incremental cost with 5-ALA versus conventional surgery using white light only amounts to euro 4550 per additional CR achieved and euro 9021 per QALY gained.

12543,Cost-effectiveness analysis of Mammostrat(R) compared with Oncotype DX(R) to inform the treatment of breast cancer,"PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of the tumor subtyping assays Mammostrat(R) and Oncotype DX(R) for assessing risk of recurrence in early-stage breast cancer and the potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a US third-party payer perspective. A 10 year Markov model was developed to estimate costs and effects of using each method of risk assessment. The percentages of patients assessed as high, moderate, or low risk were obtained from multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trials. The analysis simulated the experience of women progressing through various model states representing clinical treatments and subsequent disease. Published recurrence data for Mammostrat(R) were adjusted appropriately to account for differences between definitions and samples of Oncotype DX(R) and Mammostrat(R) in the original clinical trials. Cost and utility data were obtained from previously published studies. Sensitivity analyses examined how base-case results might differ when input values and assumptions varied. RESULTS: Base-case costs for women assessed using Mammostrat(R) were $15,782, compared with $18,051 for women assessed with Oncotype DX(R). Thus, cost savings of $2,268 resulted from using Mammostrat(R). Both Mammostrat(R) and Oncotype DX(R) resulted in similar life years (9.880 and 9.882) and quality-adjusted life years (7.935 and 7.940), respectively. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the assumptions made about recurrence are the key drivers of model results. DISCUSSION: Cost savings associated with the use of Mammostrat(R) instead of Oncotype DX(R) are largely due to the difference in cost between the two tests. Since survival and quality-adjusted life years were similar using either assay, Mammostrat(R) has economic advantages for women with early-stage breast cancer.",2014-01-15077,24470765,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Kimberly Mislick,2014,6 /,37-47,No,24470765,"Kimberly Mislick; Warren Schonfeld; Carolyn Bodnar; Kuo Bianchini Tong; Cost-effectiveness analysis of Mammostrat(R) compared with Oncotype DX(R) to inform the treatment of breast cancer, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 6():1178-6981; 37-47",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tumor subtyping assay Mammostrat® vs. Tumor subtyping assay Oncotype DX® for assessing risk of recurrence in early-stage breast cancer and the potential benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy.,"High, moderate, and low risk of recurrent breast cancer",Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,10 Years,3.00,Not Stated,453600,United States,2012,511322.9

Reimbursement coverage for smoking cessation therapies remains limited in Canada and the United States despite the health and economic benefits of smoking cessation. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of varenicline compared with other smoking cessation interventions in Canada using the Benefits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes (BENESCO) model. METHODS: Efficacy rates of the standard course (12 weeks) varenicline, extended course (12 + 12 weeks) varenicline, bupropion, nicotine replacement therapy and unaided intervention were derived based on a published mixed treatment comparison methodology and analysed within a Markov cohort model to estimate their cost-effectiveness over the lifetime cycle.

12548,Using prediction intervals from random-effects meta-analyses in an economic model,"OBJECTIVES: When incorporating treatment effect estimates derived from a random-effect meta-analysis it is tempting to use the confidence bounds to determine the potential range of treatment effect. However, prediction intervals reflect the potential effect of a technology rather than the more narrowly defined average treatment effect. Using a case study of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy, this study investigates the impact on a cost-utility analysis of using clinical effectiveness derived from random-effects meta-analyses presented as confidence bounds and prediction intervals, respectively. METHODS: To determine the cost-utility of robot-assisted prostatectomy, an economic model was developed. The clinical effectiveness of robot-assisted surgery compared with open and conventional laparoscopic surgery was estimated using meta-analysis of peer-reviewed publications. Assuming treatment effect would vary across studies due to both sampling variability and differences between surgical teams, random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool effect estimates. RESULTS: Using the confidence bounds approach the mean and median ICER was euro24,193 and euro26,731/QALY (95%CI: euro13,752 to euro68,861/QALY), respectively. The prediction interval approach produced an equivalent mean and median ICER of euro26,920 and euro26,643/QALY (95%CI: -euro135,244 to euro239,166/QALY), respectively. Using prediction intervals, there is a probability of 0.042 that robot-assisted surgery will result in a net reduction in QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: Using prediction intervals rather than confidence bounds does not affect the point estimate of the treatment effect. In meta-analyses with significant heterogeneity, the use of prediction intervals will produce wider ranges of treatment effect, and hence result in greater uncertainty, but a better reflection of the effect of the technology.",2014-01-15079,24472222,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Conor Teljeur,2014,30 / 1,44-9,No,24472222,"Conor Teljeur; Michelle O'Neill; Patrick Moran; Linda Murphy; Patricia Harrington; Mairin Ryan; Martin Flattery; Using prediction intervals from random-effects meta-analyses in an economic model, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, ; 30(1):0266-4623; 44-9",QALY,Ireland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Radical prostatectomy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Mixture of open and laparoscopic surgical methods in men requiring radical prostatectomy mix of open and laparoscopic surgery,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,24193,Euro,2012,35067.95

This study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of one time only PAD screening using Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) test and subsequent anti platelet preventive treatment (low dose aspirin or clopidogrel) in individuals at high risk for acute cardiovascular events compared to no screening and no treatment using decision analytic modelling. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was developed to evaluate the life time cost-effectiveness of the strategy of selective PAD screening and consequent preventive treatment compared to no screening and no preventive treatment. The analysis was conducted from the Dutch societal perspective and to address decision uncertainty, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. Results were based on average values of 1000 Monte Carlo simulations and using discount rates of 1.5% and 4% for effects and costs respectively. One way sensitivity analyses were performed to identify the two most influential model parameters affecting model outputs. Then, a two way sensitivity analysis was conducted for combinations of values tested for these two most influential parameters. RESULTS: For the PAD screening strategy, life years and quality adjusted life years gained were 21.79 and 15.66 respectively at a lifetime cost of 26,548 Euros. Compared to no screening and treatment (20.69 life years, 15.58 Quality Adjusted Life Years, 28,052 Euros), these results indicate that PAD screening and treatment is a dominant strategy. The cost effectiveness acceptability curves show 88% probability of PAD screening being cost effective at the Willingness To Pay (WTP) threshold of 40000 Euros. In a scenario analysis using clopidogrel as an alternative anti-platelet drug, PAD screening strategy remained dominant. CONCLUSION: This decision analysis suggests that targeted ABI screening and consequent secondary prevention of cardiovascular events using low dose aspirin or clopidogrel in the identified patients is a cost-effective strategy. Implementation of targeted PAD screening and subsequent treatment in primary care practices and in public health programs is likely to improve the societal health and to save health care costs by reducing catastrophic cardiovascular events.",2014-01-15084,24476213,BMC Public Health,Anil Vaidya,2014,14 /,89,No,24476213,"Anil Vaidya; Manuela A Joore; Arina J Ten Cate-Hoek; Hugo Ten Cate; Johan L Severens; Screen or not to screen for peripheral arterial disease: guidance from a decision model, BMC Public Health, ; 14():1471-2458; 89",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ankle Brachial Index screening with aspirin treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- No screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,-24425,Euro,2012,-35404.24

12557,Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in 65-year-old men remains cost-effective with contemporary epidemiology and management,"OBJECTIVES: The epidemiology and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) has changed significantly, with lower prevalence, increased longevity of patients, increased use of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), and improved outcome. The clinical and health economic effectiveness of one-time screening of 65-year-old men was assessed within this context. METHODS: One-time ultrasound screening of 65-year-old men (invited) versus no screening (control) was analysed in a Markov model. Data on the natural course of AAA (risk of repair and rupture) was based on randomised controlled trials. Screening detected AAA prevalence (1.7%), surgical management (50% EVAR), repair outcome, costs, and long-term survival were based on contemporary population-based data. Incremental cost-efficiency ratios (ICER), absolute and relative risk reduction for death from AAA (ARR, RRR), numbers needed to screen (NNS), and life-years gained were calculated. Annual discounting was 3.5%. RESULTS: In base case at 13-years follow-up the ICER was euro14,706 per incremental quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); ARR was 15.1 per 10,000 invited, NNS was 530, and QALYs gained were 56.5 per 10,000 invited. RRR was 42% (from 0.36% in control to 0.21% in invited). In a lifetime analysis the ICER of screening decreased to euro7,570/QALY. The parameters with highest impact on the cost-efficiency of screening in the sensitivity analysis were the prevalence of AAA (threshold value <0.5%) and degree of incidental detection in the control cohort.

An informative approach to explore the value of vaccination is to consider what vaccine efficacy would be required for a program to be considered cost-effective. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the current elderly (65+ years) influenza vaccination program in Australia, we modelled how the hypothetical removal of vaccination would increase current disease burden estimates depending on alternative vaccine efficacy assumptions. The base-case results of the analysis found that the existing elderly vaccination program is likely to be cost-effective (under A$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained) if the vaccine efficacy is above approximately 30%.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis, using cost and quality-of-life data gathered in a trial of SE for veterans with SCI. SETTING: SCI centers in the Veterans Health Administration. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N=157) who completed a study of SE in 6 SCI centers. Subjects were randomly assigned to the intervention of SE (n=81) or treatment as usual (n=76). INTERVENTION: A vocational rehabilitation program of SE for veterans with SCI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and quality-adjusted life years, which were estimated from the Veterans Rand 36-Item Health Survey, extrapolated to Veterans Rand 6 Dimension utilities. RESULTS: Average cost for the SE intervention was $1821. In 1 year of follow-up, estimated total costs, including health care utilization and travel expenses, and average quality-adjusted life years were not significantly different between groups, suggesting the Spinal Cord Injury Vocational Integration Program intervention was not cost-effective compared with usual care. CONCLUSIONS: An intensive program of SE for veterans with SCI, which is more effective in achieving competitive employment, is not cost-effective after 1 year of follow-up.

12560,The cost-effectiveness of a trial of labor accrues with multiple subsequent vaginal deliveries,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to estimate costs and outcomes of subsequent trials of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) compared with elective repeat cesarean deliveries (ERCD). STUDY DESIGN: To compare TOLAC and ERCD, maternal and neonatal decision analytic models were built for each hypothetic subsequent delivery. We assumed that only women without previa would undergo TOLAC for their second delivery, that women with successful TOLAC would desire future TOLAC, and that women who chose ERCD would undergo subsequent ERCD. Main outcome measures were maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity rates, direct costs, and quality-adjusted life years. Values were derived from the literature. One-way and Monte-Carlo sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: TOLAC was less costly and more effective for most models. A progression of decreasing incremental cost and increasing incremental effectiveness of TOLAC was found for maternal outcomes with increasing numbers of subsequent deliveries. This progression was also displayed among neonatal outcomes and was most prominent when neonatal and maternal outcomes were combined, with an incremental cost and effectiveness of -$4700.00 and .073, respectively, for the sixth delivery. Net-benefit analysis showed an increase in the benefit of TOLAC with successive deliveries for all outcomes. The maternal model of the second delivery was sensitive to cost of delivery and emergent cesarean delivery. Successive maternal models became more robust, with the models of the third-sixth deliveries sensitive only to cost of delivery. Neonatal models were not sensitive to any variables.

A progression of decreasing incremental cost and increasing incremental effectiveness of TOLAC was found for maternal outcomes with increasing numbers of subsequent deliveries. This progression was also displayed among neonatal outcomes and was most prominent when neonatal and maternal outcomes were combined, with an incremental cost and effectiveness of -$4700.00 and .073, respectively, for the sixth delivery. Net-benefit analysis showed an increase in the benefit of TOLAC with successive deliveries for all outcomes. The maternal model of the second delivery was sensitive to cost of delivery and emergent cesarean delivery. Successive maternal models became more robust, with the models of the third-sixth deliveries sensitive only to cost of delivery. Neonatal models were not sensitive to any variables. CONCLUSION: Although nearly equally effective relative to ERCD for the second delivery, TOLAC becomes less costly and more effective with subsequent deliveries.",2014-01-15101,24487008,Am J Obstet Gynecol,Kevin M Wymer,2014,211 / 1,56.e1-56.e12,No,24487008,"Kevin M Wymer; Ya-Chen Tina Shih; Beth A Plunkett; The cost-effectiveness of a trial of labor accrues with multiple subsequent vaginal deliveries, Am J Obstet Gynecol, ; 211(1):0002-9378; 56.e1-56.e12",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Child born through natural labor after previous cesarean delivery vs. Elective repeat cesarean deliveries,"With mother who previously had a full-term, low transverse cesearean delivery",1 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,10323500,United States,2012,11637217.69
12562,Pharmacologic regimens for knee osteoarthritis prevention: can they be cost-effective?,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the target populations and drug efficacy, toxicity, cost, and initiation age thresholds under which a pharmacologic regimen for knee osteoarthritis (OA) prevention could be cost-effective. DESIGN: We used the Osteoarthritis Policy (OAPol) Model, a validated state-transition simulation model of knee OA, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using disease-modifying OA drugs (DMOADs) as prophylaxis for the disease. We assessed four cohorts at varying risk for developing OA: (1) no risk factors, (2) obese, (3) history of knee injury, and (4) high-risk (obese with history of knee injury). The base case DMOAD was initiated at age 50 with 40% efficacy in the first year, 5% failure per subsequent year, 0.22% major toxicity, and annual cost of $1,000. Outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Key parameters were varied in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For the high-risk cohort, base case prophylaxis increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.04 and lifetime costs by $4,600, and produced an ICER of $118,000 per QALY gained. ICERs >$150,000/QALY were observed when comparing the base case DMOAD to the standard of care in the knee injury only cohort; for the obese only and no risk factors cohorts, the base case DMOAD was less cost-effective than the standard of care. Regimens priced at $3,000 per year and higher demonstrated ICERs above cost-effectiveness thresholds consistent with current US standards.

12563,Effectiveness and cost effectiveness of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis in a portfolio of prevention programs for injection drug users in mixed HIV epidemics,"BACKGROUND: Pre-exposure prophylaxis with oral antiretroviral treatment (oral PrEP) for HIV-uninfected injection drug users (IDUs) is potentially useful in controlling HIV epidemics with a significant injection drug use component. We estimated the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of strategies for using oral PrEP in various combinations with methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) and antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Ukraine, a representative case for mixed HIV epidemics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic compartmental model of the HIV epidemic in a population of non-IDUs, IDUs who inject opiates, and IDUs in MMT, adding an oral PrEP program (tenofovir/emtricitabine, 49% susceptibility reduction) for uninfected IDUs. We analyzed intervention portfolios consisting of oral PrEP (25% or 50% of uninfected IDUs), MMT (25% of IDUs), and ART (80% of all eligible patients). We measured health care costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), HIV prevalence, HIV infections averted, and incremental cost effectiveness. A combination of PrEP for 50% of IDUs and MMT lowered HIV prevalence the most in both IDUs and the general population. ART combined with MMT and PrEP (50% access) averted the most infections (14,267). For a PrEP cost of $950, the most cost-effective strategy was MMT, at $520/QALY gained versus no intervention. The next most cost-effective strategy consisted of MMT and ART, costing $1,000/QALY gained compared to MMT alone. Further adding PrEP (25% access) was also cost effective by World Health Organization standards, at $1,700/QALY gained. PrEP alone became as cost effective as MMT at a cost of $650, and cost saving at $370 or less. CONCLUSIONS: Oral PrEP for IDUs can be part of an effective and cost-effective strategy to control HIV in regions where injection drug use is a significant driver of the epidemic.

12566,Cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor versus clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Ticagrelor demonstrated a significant reduction in major cardiac events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared with clopidogrel in the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel in ACS patients from the perspective of the Canadian publicly funded health care system. METHODS: A two-part model was developed consisting of a 1-year decision tree and a lifetime Markov model. Within the decision tree, patients remained event-free, experienced a nonfatal myocardial infarction, a nonfatal stroke, or death due to vascular or nonvascular related causes based on data from the PLATO trial. The lifetime Markov model followed these patients and allowed for subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Patient utility and resource use were derived from the PLATO trial. Transition probabilities and specific Canadian unit costs were derived from published sources. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the base case lifetime analysis, treatment with ticagrelor resulted in more years of life per person (0.097), more quality-adjusted life years per person (QALYs, 0.084), and an incremental cost per QALY gained of $9,745 (Canadian$), assuming a generic cost for clopidogrel. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the base case analysis, with a 93% probability of being below $20,000 per QALY gained and a 99% probability of being below $30,000 per QALY gained.

12567,A cost-effectiveness analysis of a telephone-linked care intervention for individuals with Type 2 diabetes,"AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an automated telephone-linked care intervention, Australian TLC Diabetes, delivered over 6 months to patients with established Type 2 diabetes mellitus and high glycated haemoglobin level, compared to usual care. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to synthesize data from a randomized controlled trial of TLC Diabetes (n=120) and other published evidence. The 5-year model consisted of three health states related to glycaemic control: ''sub-optimal'' HbA1c >/=58mmol/mol (7.5%); ''average'' >/=48-57mmol/mol (6.5-7.4%) and ''optimal'' <48mmol/mol (6.5%) and a fourth state ''all-cause death''. Key outcomes of the model include discounted health system costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYS) using SF-6D utility weights. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Annual medication costs for the intervention group were lower than usual care [ INTERVENTION: pound1076 (95%CI: pound947, pound1206) versus usual care pound1271 (95%CI: pound1115, pound1428) p=0.052]. The estimated mean cost for intervention group participants over five years, including the intervention cost, was pound17,152 versus pound17,835 for the usual care group. The corresponding mean QALYs were 3.381 (SD 0.40) for the intervention group and 3.377 (SD 0.41) for the usual care group. Results were sensitive to the model duration, utility values and medication costs. CONCLUSION: The Australian TLC Diabetes intervention was a low-cost investment for individuals with established diabetes and may result in medication cost-savings to the health system.

12568,The cost effectiveness of acellular dermal matrix in expander-implant immediate breast reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: Expander-implant breast reconstruction is often supplemented with acellular dermal matrix (ADM). The use of acellular dermal matrix has allowed for faster, less painful expansions and improved aesthetics, but with increased cost. Our goal was to provide the first cost utility analysis of using acellular dermal matrix in two-stage, expander-implant immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify complication rates for two-stage, expander-implant immediate breast reconstruction with and without acellular dermal matrix. The probabilities of the most common complications were combined with Medicare Current Procedural Terminology reimbursement codes and expert utility estimates to fit into a decision model. The decision model evaluated the cost effectiveness of acellular dermal matrix relative to reconstructions without it. Retail costs for ADM were derived from the LifeCell 2012 company catalogue for Alloderm. RESULTS: The overall complication rates were 30% and 34.5% with and without ADM. The decision model revealed a baseline cost increase of $361.96 when acellular dermal matrix is used. The increase in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) is 1.37 in the population with acellular dermal matrix. This yields a cost effective incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $264.20/QALY. Univariate sensitivity analysis confirmed that using acellular dermal matrix is cost effective even when using retail costs for unilateral and bilateral reconstructions.

12569,Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent cellulitis of the leg: economic analysis of the PATCH I & II trials,"BACKGROUND: Cellulitis (erysipelas) is a recurring and debilitating bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissue. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotic treatment to prevent the recurrence of cellulitis using low dose penicillin V in patients following a first episode (6 months prophylaxis) and more recurrent cellulitis (12 months prophylaxis, or 6 months in those declining 12 months). METHODS: Within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using the findings of two randomised placebo-controlled multicentre trials (PATCH I and PATCH II), in which patients recruited in the UK and Ireland were followed-up for up to 3 years. Incremental cost, reduction in recurrence, cost per recurrence prevented and cost/QALY were estimated. National unit and reference costs for England in 2010 were applied to resource use, exploring NHS and societal perspectives. A total of 397 patients from the two trials contributed to the analysis. RESULTS: There was a 29% reduction in the number of recurrences occurring within the trial (IRR: 0.71 95%CI: 0.53 to 0.90, p = 0.02), corresponding to an absolute reduction of recurrence of 0.31 recurrences/patient (95%CI: 0.05 to 0.59, p = 0.02). Incremental costs of prophylaxis suggested a small cost saving but were not statistically significant, comparing the two groups. If a decision-maker is willing to pay up to pound25,000/QALY then there is a 66% probability of antibiotic prophylaxis being cost-effective from an NHS perspective, rising to 76% probability from a secondary, societal perspective. CONCLUSION: Following first episode or recurrent cellulitis of the leg, prophylactic low dose penicillin is a very low cost intervention which, on balance, is effective and cost-effective at preventing subsequent attacks. Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces cellulitis recurrence by nearly a third but is not associated with a significant increase in costs.",2014-01-15126,24551029,PLoS One,James M Mason,2014,9 / 2,e82694,No,24551029,"James M Mason; Kim S Thomas; Angela M Crook; Katharine A Foster; Joanne R Chalmers; Andrew J Nunn; Hywel C Williams; Prophylactic antibiotics to prevent cellulitis of the leg: economic analysis of the PATCH I & II trials, PLoS One , ; 9(2):1932-6203; e82694",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic Antibiotics vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.50,3.50,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2010,Not Stated

DESIGN: Data were obtained from a pragmatic, multi-centre, randomized controlled ''open'' trial conducted in seven centres in the UK between 2006 and 2008. Effectiveness was estimated as Quality-Adjusted Life Years. Resource use was measured prospectively on all patients using information provided by patients in postal questionnaires, case-note review, electronic record review and interviews with patients. Unit costs were obtained from the literature and applied to the relevant resource use to estimate total costs. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data. RESULTS: There were no substantial differences in the utility scores between treatment groups in all follow-up assessments, in the use of medication or outpatient visits and both groups report a similar frequency of contact with health care professionals. After controlling for baseline utility and using imputed dataset, treatment was associated with a reduction in QALY of 0.004 and a additional cost of pound69.49. The probability that the intervention is cost-effective for thresholds between pound20,000 and pound30,000 is around 45%. CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence that the addition of the intervention had any effect on costs or outcomes.

12571,Cost-effectiveness of ranolazine added to standard-of-care treatment in patients with chronic stable angina pectoris,"Ranolazine has been shown to decrease angina pectoris frequency and nitroglycerin consumption. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of ranolazine when added to standard-of-care (SoC) antianginals compared with SoC alone in patients with stable coronary disease experiencing >/=3 attacks/week. A Markov model utilizing a societal perspective, a 1-month cycle length, and a 1-year time horizon was developed to estimate costs (2013 US$) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for patients receiving and not receiving ranolazine. Patients entered the model in 1 of the 4 angina frequency health states based upon Seattle Angina Questionnaire angina frequency (SAQAF) scores (100=no; 61 to 99=monthly; 31 to 60=weekly; and 0 to 30=daily angina) and were allowed to transition between states or to death based upon probabilities derived from the Efficacy of Ranolazine in Chronic Angina and other studies. Patients not responding to ranolazine in month 1 (not improving >/=1 SAQAF health state) were assumed to discontinue ranolazine and behave like SoC patients. Ranolazine patients lived a mean of 0.700 QALYs at a cost of $15,661. Those not receiving ranolazine lived 0.659 QALYs and at a cost of $14,321. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the addition of ranolazine was $32,682/QALY. The ICER was most sensitive to ranolazine cost but only exceeded $50,000/QALY when the cost of ranolazine increased >32% above base case. The ICER remained <$50,000/QALY when indirect costs were excluded, and mortality rates were assumed equivalent between SAQAF health states. Monte Carlo simulation found ranolazine cost-effective in 97% of 10,000 iterations at a $50,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold.

12572,"Improving the quality of percutaneous revascularisation in patients with multivessel disease in Australia: cost-effectiveness, public health implications, and budget impact of FFR-guided PCI","PURPOSE: The international multicentre FAME Study (n=1,005) demonstrated significant health benefits for patients undergoing multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) guided by fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement compared with angiography guidance alone (ANGIO). We determined the cost-effectiveness and the public health/budget impact for Australia. METHODS: We performed a prospective economic evaluation comparing FFR vs. ANGIO in patients with multivessel disease based on original patient-level FAME data. We used Australian utilities (EQ-5D) and costs to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness adopting the societal perspective. The public health and budget impact from the payer''s perspective was based on Australian PCI registries. Uncertainty was explored using deterministic sensitivity analyses and the bootstrap method (n=5,000 samples). RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that FFR was cost-saving and reduces costs by 1,776 AUD per patient during one year. Over a two-year time horizon, the public health impact ranged from 7.8 to 73.9 QALYs gained and the budget impact from 1.8 to 14.5 million AUD total cost savings.

The aim of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of 5mg ulipristal as an add-on therapy to standard pre-surgical observation and treatment in Hungary. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model was developed using a 10-year time horizon. Ulipristal was compared with pre-surgical observation and immediate hysterectomy. The model comprised the following mutually exclusive health states: mild, moderate, severe, or persistent severe excessive bleeding disorder; myomectomy; post-myomectomy with mildly to moderately excessive bleeding disorder; post-myomectomy with severely excessive bleeding disorder; hysterectomy; post-hysterectomy; post-menopause; and death. Transition probabilities and utility values were obtained from clinical trials and the scientific literature. Resource utilisation and unit costs were derived from a consensus panel of clinical experts, National Health Insurance Fund tariffs, and publications. RESULTS: Adding a 3-month course of ulipristal to pre-operative observation was predicted to achieve an additional 0.021 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an estimated incremental cost of euro397, which would result in an incremental cost of euro19,200/QALY. When 3 months of ulipristal therapy was compared with immediate hysterectomy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was reduced to euro3575/QALY. The results were most sensitive to the utility value of the post-hysterectomy health state but responsive to changes in other model parameters.

12575,Cost-effectiveness of treatment of diabetic macular edema,"BACKGROUND: Macular edema is the most common cause of vision loss among patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of different treatments of diabetic macular edema (DME). DESIGN: Markov model. DATA SOURCES: Published literature and expert opinion. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with clinically significant DME. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Laser treatment, intraocular injections of triamcinolone or a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor, or a combination of both. OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted costs, gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: All treatments except laser monotherapy substantially reduced costs, and all treatments except triamcinolone monotherapy increased QALYs. Laser treatment plus a VEGF inhibitor achieved the greatest benefit, gaining 0.56 QALYs at a cost of $6975 for an ICER of $12 410 per QALY compared with laser treatment plus triamcinolone. Monotherapy with a VEGF inhibitor achieved similar outcomes to combination therapy with laser treatment plus a VEGF inhibitor.

12580,Comparative cost-effectiveness of the HeartWare versus HeartMate II left ventricular assist devices used in the United Kingdom National Health Service bridge-to-transplant program for patients with heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced heart failure may receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as part of a bridge-to-transplant (BTT) strategy. The United Kingdom National Health Service (UK NHS) has financed a BTT program in which the predominant LVADs used have been the HeartMate II (HM II; Thoratec, Pleasanton, CA) and HeartWare (HW; HeartWare International, Inc. Framingham, MA). We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of the use of these within the NHS program. METHODS: Individual patient data from the UK NHS Blood and Transplant Data Base were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and competing outcomes methodologies. Outcomes were time to death, time to heart transplant (HT), and cumulative incidences of HT, death on LVAD support, and LVAD explantation. A semi-Markov multistate economic model was built to assess cost-effectiveness. The perspective was from the NHS, discount rates were 3.5%. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost (2011 prices in GB pound) per QALY (ICER) for HW vs HM II. RESULTS: Survival was better with HW support than with HM II. Cumulative incidence of HT was low for both groups (11% at ~2 years). HW patients accrued 4.99 lifetime QALYs costing pound258,913 ($410,970), HM II patients accrued 3.84 QALYs costing pound231,871 ($368,048); deterministic and probabilistic ICERs for HW vs HM II were pound23,530 ($37,349) and pound20,799 ($33,014), respectively.

12581,Economic outcomes of maintenance gefitinib for locally advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with unknown EGFR mutations: a semi-Markov model analysis,"BACKGROUND: Maintenance gefitinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in patients from eastern Asian with locally advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after four chemotherapeutic cycles (21 days per cycle) of first-line platinum-based combination chemotherapy without disease progression. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of maintenance gefitinib therapy after four chemotherapeutic cycle''s stand first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with unknown EGFR mutations, from a Chinese health care system perspective. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A semi-Markov model was designed to evaluate cost-effectiveness of the maintenance gefitinib treatment. Two-parametric Weibull and Log-logistic distribution were fitted to PFS and overall survival curves independently. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the model designed. The model base-case analysis suggested that maintenance gefitinib would increase benefits in a 1, 3, 6 or 10-year time horizon, with incremental $184,829, $19,214, $19,328, and $21,308 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively. The most sensitive influential variable in the cost-effectiveness analysis was utility of PFS plus rash, followed by utility of PFS plus diarrhoea, utility of progressed disease, price of gefitinib, cost of follow-up treatment in progressed survival state, and utility of PFS on oral therapy. The price of gefitinib is the most significant parameter that could reduce the incremental cost per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost-effective probability of maintenance gefitinib was zero under the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $16,349 (3 x per-capita gross domestic product of China). The sensitivity analyses all suggested that the model was robust. CONCLUSIONS: Maintenance gefitinib following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for patients with locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC with unknown EGFR mutations is not cost-effective.

12582,The appropriate use of neuroimaging in the diagnostic work-up of dementia: an economic literature review and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Structural brain imaging is often performed to establish the underlying causes of dementia. However, recommendations differ as to who should receive neuroimaging and whether computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be used. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness in Ontario of offering structural imaging to all patients with mild to moderate dementia compared with offering it selectively according to guidelines from the Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia (CCC). We compared the cost-effectiveness of CT and MRI as first-line strategies. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search (2000 to 2013) to identify cost-effectiveness studies of clinical prediction rules and structural imaging modalities. Studies were assessed for quality and applicability to Ontario. We also developed a model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of clinical guidelines (image all versus according to CCC) and modalities (CT versus MRI). Transition probabilities, utilities, and costs were obtained from published literature or expert opinion. Results were expressed in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: No relevant cost-effectiveness analyses were identified in the published literature. According to the base-case results of our model, the most effective and cost-effective strategy is to image patients who meet CCC criteria with CT and to follow-up with MRI for suspected cases of space-occupying lesions (SOL). However, the results were sensitive to the specificity of MRI for detecting vascular causes of dementia. At a specificity of 64%, the most cost-effective strategy is CCC followed by MRI. LIMITATIONS: Studies used to estimate diagnostic accuracy were limited by a lack of a gold standard test for establishing the cause of dementia. The model does not include costs to patients and their families, nor does it account for patient preferences about diagnostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Given the relative prevalence of vascular dementia and SOLs, and the improvement in QALYs associated with treatment, the strategy with the greatest combined sensitivity (CCC with CT followed by MRI for patients with SOLs) results in the greatest number of QALYs and is the least costly.

We also developed a model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of clinical guidelines (image all versus according to CCC) and modalities (CT versus MRI). Transition probabilities, utilities, and costs were obtained from published literature or expert opinion. Results were expressed in terms of costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: No relevant cost-effectiveness analyses were identified in the published literature. According to the base-case results of our model, the most effective and cost-effective strategy is to image patients who meet CCC criteria with CT and to follow-up with MRI for suspected cases of space-occupying lesions (SOL). However, the results were sensitive to the specificity of MRI for detecting vascular causes of dementia. At a specificity of 64%, the most cost-effective strategy is CCC followed by MRI. LIMITATIONS: Studies used to estimate diagnostic accuracy were limited by a lack of a gold standard test for establishing the cause of dementia. The model does not include costs to patients and their families, nor does it account for patient preferences about diagnostic information. CONCLUSIONS: Given the relative prevalence of vascular dementia and SOLs, and the improvement in QALYs associated with treatment, the strategy with the greatest combined sensitivity (CCC with CT followed by MRI for patients with SOLs) results in the greatest number of QALYs and is the least costly. Due to limitations in the clinical data and challenges in the interpretation of this evidence, the model should be considered a framework for assessing uncertainty in the evidence base rather than providing definitive answers to the research questions.",2014-01-15153,24592297,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,S L Bermingham,2014,14 / 2,1-67,No,24592297,"S L Bermingham; The appropriate use of neuroimaging in the diagnostic work-up of dementia: an economic literature review and cost-effectiveness analysis, Ont Health Technol Assess Ser, ; 14(2):1915-7398; 1-67",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) vs. CCC (Canadian Consensus Conference) with CT(computed tomography) followed by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-19770.27,Canada,2012,-22291.26
12585,Cost-effectiveness of Telaprevir combination therapy for chronic hepatitis C,"OBJECTIVE: To explore the expected long-term health and economic outcomes of telaprevir (TVR) plus peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin (PR), a regimen that demonstrated substantially increased sustained virologic response (SVR) compared with PR alone in adults with chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) and compensated liver disease in the Phase III studies ADVANCE (treatment-naive patients) and REALIZE (relapsers, partial responders, and null responders to previous PR treatment). STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of TVR+PR vs. PR in the United States (US). METHODS: Patients first moved through the 72-week decision-tree treatment phase of the model and then entered the cyclic Markov post-treatment phase. Clinical data (patient characteristics, SVR rates, and adverse event rates and durations) were obtained from ADVANCE and REALIZE. Health-state transition probabilities, drug and other costs (in 2012/2013 US dollars), and utility values were obtained from the trials, published studies, and publicly available sources. Outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: Regardless of treatment history, patients receiving TVR+PR were projected to experience fewer liver-disease complications, more life-years, and more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than patients receiving PR. In prior relapsers, TVR+PR was dominant, with lower total medical costs and more QALYs.

12589,Health outcomes and cost impact of the new WHO 2013 guidelines on prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Zambia,"BACKGROUND: Countries are currently progressing towards the elimination of new paediatric HIV infections by 2015. WHO published new consolidated guidelines in June 2013, which now recommend either ''Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) for women living with HIV during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Option B)'' or ''Lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV (Option B+)'', while de facto phasing out Option A. This study examined health outcomes and cost impact of the shift to WHO 2013 recommendations in Zambia. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed based on the national health system perspective. Estimated risk and number of cases of HIV transmission to infants and to serodiscordant partners, and proportions of HIV-infected pregnant women with CD4 count of </=350 cells/mm3 to initiate ART were compared between 2010 Option A and the 2013 recommendations. Total costs of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services per annual cohort of pregnant women, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per infection averted and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were examined. RESULTS: Our analysis suggested that the shift from 2010 Option A to the 2013 guidelines would result in a 33% reduction of the risk of HIV transmission among exposed infants. The risk of transmission to serodiscordant partners for a period of 24 months would be reduced by 72% with ''ARVs during pregnancy and breastfeeding'' and further reduced by 15% with ''Lifelong ART''. The probability of HIV-infected pregnant women to initiate ART would increase by 80%. It was also suggested that while the shift would generate higher PMTCT costs, it would be cost-saving in the long term as it spares future treatment costs by preventing infections in infants and partners.

12591,Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system vs. usual medical treatment for menorrhagia: an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To undertake an economic evaluation alongside the largest randomised controlled trial comparing Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device (''LNG-IUS'') and usual medical treatment for women with menorrhagia in primary care; and compare the cost-effectiveness findings using two alternative measures of quality of life. METHODS: 571 women with menorrhagia from 63 UK centres were randomised between February 2005 and July 2009. Women were randomised to having a LNG-IUS fitted, or usual medical treatment, after discussing with their general practitioner their contraceptive needs or desire to avoid hormonal treatment. The treatment was specified prior to randomisation. For the economic evaluation we developed a state transition (Markov) model with a 24 month follow-up. The model structure was informed by the trial women''s pathway and clinical experts. The economic evaluation adopted a UK National Health Service perspective and was based on an outcome of incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) estimated using both EQ-5D and SF-6D. RESULTS: Using EQ-5D, LNG-IUS was the most cost-effective treatment for menorrhagia. LNG-IUS costs pound100 more than usual medical treatment but generated 0.07 more QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for LNG-IUS compared to usual medical treatment was pound1600 per additional QALY. Using SF-6D, usual medical treatment was the most cost-effective treatment. Usual medical treatment was both less costly ( pound100) and generated 0.002 more QALYs. CONCLUSION: Impact on quality of life is the primary indicator of treatment success in menorrhagia. However, the most cost-effective treatment differs depending on the quality of life measure used to estimate the QALY. Under UK guidelines LNG-IUS would be the recommended treatment for menorrhagia.

12592,Prevention of HPV-related cancers in Norway: cost-effectiveness of expanding the HPV vaccination program to include pre-adolescent boys,"BACKGROUND: Increasingly, countries have introduced female vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV), causally linked to several cancers and genital warts, but few have recommended vaccination of boys. Declining vaccine prices and strong evidence of vaccine impact on reducing HPV-related conditions in both women and men prompt countries to reevaluate whether HPV vaccination of boys is warranted. METHODS: A previously-published dynamic model of HPV transmission was empirically calibrated to Norway. Reductions in the incidence of HPV, including both direct and indirect benefits, were applied to a natural history model of cervical cancer, and to incidence-based models for other non-cervical HPV-related diseases. We calculated the health outcomes and costs of the different HPV-related conditions under a gender-neutral vaccination program compared to a female-only program. RESULTS: Vaccine price had a decisive impact on results. For example, assuming 71% coverage, high vaccine efficacy and a reasonable vaccine tender price of $75 per dose, we found vaccinating both girls and boys fell below a commonly cited cost-effectiveness threshold in Norway ($83,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained) when including vaccine benefit for all HPV-related diseases. However, at the current market price, including boys would not be considered ''good value for money.'' For settings with a lower cost-effectiveness threshold ($30,000/QALY), it would not be considered cost-effective to expand the current program to include boys, unless the vaccine price was less than $36/dose. Increasing vaccination coverage to 90% among girls was more effective and less costly than the benefits achieved by vaccinating both genders with 71% coverage. CONCLUSIONS: At the anticipated tender price, expanding the HPV vaccination program to boys may be cost-effective and may warrant a change in the current female-only vaccination policy in Norway.

12594,The cost-effectiveness of improved hepatitis C virus therapies in HIV/hepatitis C virus coinfected patients,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of strategies to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) in HIV/HCV coinfected patients in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Simulated cohort of HIV/HCV genotype 1 coinfected, noncirrhotic, HCV treatment-naive individuals enrolled in US HIV guideline-concordant care. DESIGN/INTERVENTIONS: Monte Carlo simulation comparing five strategies: no treatment; dual therapy with pegylated-interferon (PEG) and ribavirin (RBV); ''PEG/RBV trial'' in which all patients initiate dual therapy and switch to triple therapy upon failure; ''IL28B triage'' in which patients initiate either dual therapy or triple therapy based on their IL28B allele type; and PEG/RBV and telaprevir (TPV) triple therapy. Sensitivity analyses varied efficacies and costs and included a scenario with interferon (IFN)-free therapy. MAIN MEASURES: Sustained virologic response (SVR), life expectancy, discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), lifetime medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in $/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. RESULTS: ''PEG/RBV trial,'' ''IL28B triage,'' and ''triple therapy'' each provided 72% SVR and extended QALE compared with ''dual therapy'' by 1.12, 1.14, and 1.15 QALY, respectively. The ICER of ''PEG/RBV trial'' compared with ''dual therapy'' was $37 500/QALY. ''IL28B triage'' and ''triple therapy'' provided little benefit compared with ''PEG/RBV trial,'' and both had ICERs exceeding $300 000/QALY. In sensitivity analyses, IFN-free treatment attaining 90% SVR had an ICER less than $100 000/QALY compared with ''PEG/RBV trial'' when its cost was $109 000 or less (125% of the cost of PEG/RBV/TVR). CONCLUSION: HCV protease inhibitors are most efficiently used in HIV/HCV coinfection after a trial of PEG/RBV, sparing protease inhibitors for those who attain rapid virologic response and SVR.

''IL28B triage'' and ''triple therapy'' provided little benefit compared with ''PEG/RBV trial,'' and both had ICERs exceeding $300 000/QALY. In sensitivity analyses, IFN-free treatment attaining 90% SVR had an ICER less than $100 000/QALY compared with ''PEG/RBV trial'' when its cost was $109 000 or less (125% of the cost of PEG/RBV/TVR). CONCLUSION: HCV protease inhibitors are most efficiently used in HIV/HCV coinfection after a trial of PEG/RBV, sparing protease inhibitors for those who attain rapid virologic response and SVR.

12598,Comparative cost effectiveness of Coflex(R) interlaminar stabilization versus instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis,"INTRODUCTION: Symptomatic chronic low back and leg pain resulting from lumbar spinal stenosis is expensive to treat and manage. A randomized, controlled, multicenter US Food and Drug Administration Investigational Device Exemption clinical trial assessed treatment-related patient outcomes comparing the Coflex(R) Interlaminar Stabilization Device, an interlaminar stabilization implant inserted following decompressive surgical laminotomy in the lumbar spine, to instrumented posterolateral fusion among patients with moderate to severe spinal stenosis. This study uses patient-reported outcomes and clinical events from the trial along with costs and expected resource utilization to determine cost effectiveness. METHODS: A decision-analytic model compared outcomes over 5 years. Clinical input parameters were derived from the trial. Oswestry Disability Index scores were converted to utilities. Treatment patterns over 5 years were estimated based on claims analyses and expert opinion. A third-party payer perspective was used; costs (in $US 2013) and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses examined the influence of key parameters. Analyses were conducted using Medicare payment rates and typical commercial reimbursements. RESULTS: Five-year costs were lower for patients implanted with Coflex compared to those undergoing fusion. Average Medicare payments over 5 years were estimated at $15,182 for Coflex compared to $26,863 for the fusion control, a difference of $11,681. Mean quality-adjusted life years were higher for Coflex patients compared to controls (3.02 vs 2.97). Results indicate that patients implanted with the Coflex device derive more utility, on average, than those treated with fusion, but at substantially lower costs. The cost advantage was greater when evaluating commercial insurance payments. Subgroup analyses found that the cost advantage for Coflex relative to fusion was even larger for two-level procedures compared to one-level procedures. CONCLUSION: The Coflex Interlaminar Stabilization Device was found to be cost effective compared to instrumented posterolateral fusion for treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis. It provided higher utility at substantially lower cost.",2014-01-15176,24672250,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Jordana Kate Schmier,2014,6 /,125-31,No,24672250,"Jordana Kate Schmier; Marci Halevi; Greg Maislin; Kevin Ong; Comparative cost effectiveness of Coflex(R) interlaminar stabilization versus instrumented posterolateral lumbar fusion for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 6():1178-6981; 125-31",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Coflex interlaminar stabilization device vs. Instrumented posterlateral fusion,Not Stated,Not Stated,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-233620,United States,2013,-259547.58
12599,Cost-effectiveness analysis of orbital atherectomy plus balloon angioplasty vs balloon angioplasty alone in subjects with calcified femoropopliteal lesions,"INTRODUCTION: As cost considerations become increasingly critical when selecting optimal endovascular treatment strategies, a cost-benefit analysis was conducted comparing the Diamondback 360 degrees (R) Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) (Cardiovascular Systems, Inc., St Paul, MN, USA) and balloon angioplasty (BA) vs BA alone for treatment of calcified femoropopliteal lesions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical outcomes from COMPLIANCE 360 degrees , a prospective, multicenter, randomized study comparing OAS+BA vs BA alone for treatment of calcified femoropopliteal lesions, were correlated with cost data and previously published quality of life data. Site of service, hospital charges, and associated medical resource utilization were obtained from Uniform Billing statements for index treatments and associated revascularizations out to 1 year. Hospital costs were estimated using hospital-specific, procedure-specific cost-to-charge ratios. Length of stay and procedural data were collected from participating study sites. RESULTS: Twenty-five subjects with 38 lesions and 25 subjects with 27 lesions were randomized to the OAS+BA and BA-alone groups, respectively. Mean hospital charges (US$51,755 vs US$39,922) and estimated hospital costs (US$15,100 vs US$11,016) were higher for OAS+BA compared with BA alone (not statistically significant). Stent utilization was statistically significantly higher with BA-alone treatment for all subjects (1.1 vs 0.1, P=0.001) and in the subset of subjects with one lesion (1.0 vs 0.1, P<0.00001). There was a significant difference in cost for single-lesion versus multiple-lesion treatment. Using costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the single-lesion cohort, the 1-year incremental cost of OAS+BA vs BA alone was US$549, and incremental QALY was 0.16. This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$3,441, well below the US$50,000 threshold. CONCLUSION: One-year index procedure cost and cost-effectiveness were comparable for OAS+BA vs BA alone. This study provides compelling cost-effectiveness data for using atherectomy for treatment of calcified femoropopliteal lesions, a longstanding challenge for peripheral artery disease interventionalists.",2014-01-15177,24672251,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Barry Weinstock,2014,6 /,133-9,No,24672251,"Barry Weinstock; Raymond Dattilo; Tiffini Diage; Cost-effectiveness analysis of orbital atherectomy plus balloon angioplasty vs balloon angioplasty alone in subjects with calcified femoropopliteal lesions, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 6():1178-6981; 133-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Diamond Back 360 degrees Orbital Atherectomy System + Balloon Angioplasty vs. Balloon Angioplasty alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,3441,United States,2010,4084.13
12600,Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Quadrivalent Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine for HPV-Related Disease in Iran,"Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine has been added recently to the Iran Drug List. So, decision makers need information beyond that available from RCTs to recommend funding for this vaccination program to add it to the National Immunization program in Iran. Modeling and economic studies have addressed some of those information needs in foreign countries. In order to determine the long term benefit of this vaccine and impact of vaccine program on the future rate of cervical cancer in Iran, we described a model, based on the available economic and health effects of human papilloma virus (HPV), to estimate the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination of 15-year-old girls in Iran. Our objective is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in Iran against cervical cancer based on available data; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculations were based on a model comparing a cohort of 15-year-old girls with and without vaccination. We developed a static model based on available data in Iran on the epidemiology of HPV related health outcome. The model compared the cohort of all 15-year old girls alive in the year 2013 with and without vaccination. The cost per QALY, which was found based on our assumption for the vaccination of 15-years old girl to current situation was 439,000,000 Iranian Rial rate (IRR). By considering the key parameters in our sensitivity analysis, value varied from 251,000,000 IRR to 842,000,000 IRR.
