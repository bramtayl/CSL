26101,Choosing cost-effective interventions in psychiatry: results from the CHOICE programme of the World Health Organization,"There is increasing recognition at both the international and national level of the disease burden attributed to psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how much of this burden is or could be averted by current or scaled-up implementation of effective interventions. In addition, little is known about the costs and cost-effectiveness of such interventions in most regions of the world, even though such information is of direct relevance to increased investment and service development. This research report provides an overview of the mental health component of the World Health Organization's CHOICE project, the aim of which is to generate cost-effectiveness evidence for a large number of interventions for leading contributors to disease burden in a range of geographical and epidemiological settings around the world. To date, expected costs (expressed in international dollars) and effects (measured in terms of disability adjusted life years, DALYs) of key pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have been modelled for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and panic disorder. The results of this analysis indicate that the most efficient interventions for common mental disorders (depression and panic disorder) can be considered very cost-effective (each DALY averted costs less than one year of average per capita income), while community-based interventions for more severe mental disorders using older antipsychotic and mood stabilising drugs meet the criterion for being cost-effective (each DALY averted costs less than three times the average annual income).

26108,"Cost, affordability and cost-effectiveness of strategies to control tuberculosis in countries with high HIV prevalence","BACKGROUND: The HIV epidemic has caused a dramatic increase in tuberculosis (TB) in East and southern Africa. Several strategies have the potential to reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings, and cost and cost-effectiveness analyses can help to prioritize them when budget constraints exist. However, published cost and cost-effectiveness studies are limited. METHODS: Our objective was to compare the cost, affordability and cost-effectiveness of seven strategies for reducing the burden of TB in countries with high HIV prevalence. A compartmental difference equation model of TB and HIV and recent cost data were used to assess the costs (year 2003 USD prices) and effects (TB cases averted, deaths averted, DALYs gained) of these strategies in Kenya during the period 2004-2023. RESULTS: The three lowest cost and most cost-effective strategies were improving TB cure rates, improving TB case detection rates, and improving both together. The incremental cost of combined improvements to case detection and cure was below USD 15 million per year (7.5% of year 2000 government health expenditure); the mean cost per DALY gained of these three strategies ranged from USD 18 to USD 34. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) had the highest incremental costs, which by 2007 could be as large as total government health expenditures in year 2000. ART could also gain more DALYs than the other strategies, at a cost per DALY gained of around USD 260 to USD 530. Both the costs and effects of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (TLTI) for HIV+ individuals were low; the cost per DALY gained ranged from about USD 85 to USD 370. Averting one HIV infection for less than USD 250 would be as cost-effective as improving TB case detection and cure rates to WHO target levels. CONCLUSION: To reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings, the immediate goal should be to increase TB case detection rates and, to the extent possible, improve TB cure rates, preferably in combination. Realising the full potential of ART will require substantial new funding and strengthening of health system capacity so that increased funding can be used effectively.",2005-99-01564,16343345,BMC Public Health,Christine S M Currie,2012,12 /,130,No,16343345,"Christine S M Currie; Katherine Floyd; Brian G Williams; Christopher Dye; Katherine Floyd; Brian G Williams; Christopher Dye; Cost, affordability and cost-effectiveness of strategies to control tuberculosis in countries with high HIV prevalence, BMC Public Health, ; 12():1471-2458; 130",DALY,Kenya,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Pharmaceutical",Improving TB case detection rates to detect 70% of new smear positive cases vs. None,Area with high HIV prevalence,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,13,United States,2003,18.29

DATA SOURCES: Effectiveness data from several sources, including trials, observational studies, and expert opinion.

These were the community based newborn care package, followed by antenatal care (tetanus toxoid, screening for pre-eclampsia, screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and syphilis); skilled attendance at birth, offering first level maternal and neonatal care around childbirth; and emergency obstetric and neonatal care around and after birth.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted in year 2000 international dollars. RESULTS: The most cost effective mix of interventions was similar in Afr-E and Sear-D. These were the community based newborn care package, followed by antenatal care (tetanus toxoid, screening for pre-eclampsia, screening and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria and syphilis); skilled attendance at birth, offering first level maternal and neonatal care around childbirth; and emergency obstetric and neonatal care around and after birth. Screening and treatment of maternal syphilis, community based management of neonatal pneumonia, and steroids given during the antenatal period were relatively less cost effective in Sear-D. Scaling up all of the included interventions to 95% coverage would halve neonatal and maternal deaths. CONCLUSION: Preventive interventions at the community level for newborn babies and at the primary care level for mothers and newborn babies are extremely cost effective, but the millennium development goals for maternal and child health will not be achieved without universal access to clinical services as well.",2005-99-01607,16282407,BMJ,Taghreed Adam,2005,331 / 7525,1107,No,16282407,"Taghreed Adam; Stephen S Lim; Sumi Mehta; Zulfiqar A Bhutta; Helga Fogstad; Matthews Mathai; Jelka Zupan; Gary L Darmstadt; Stephen S Lim; Sumi Mehta; Zulfiqar A Bhutta; Helga Fogstad; Matthews Mathai; Jelka Zupan; Gary L Darmstadt; Cost effectiveness analysis of strategies for maternal and neonatal health in developing countries, BMJ, 2005-Nov-12; 331(7525):0959-8138; 1107",DALY,"Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, North Korea, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Timor-Leste",Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Pharmaceutical, Screening","Community Care of newborn + tetanus toxoid + normal delivery by skilled attendant + active management and initial treatment of postpartum haemorrhage+screening for pre-eclampsia and screening for and treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria+community based management of neonatal pneumonia+neonatal resuscitation+treatment of severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia+referral of postpartum haemorrhage+management of maternal sepsis+emergency neonatal care+screening and treatment of syphilis+management of obstructed labour, breech presentation, and fetal distress+antibiotics for preterm premature rupture of membranes+steroid for preterm birth vs. None",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,16930,United States,2000,25445.24
26168,Cost effectiveness analysis of strategies to combat malaria in developing countries,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of selected malaria control interventions in the context of reaching the millennium development goals for malaria. DESIGN: Generalised cost effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Efficacy data came from the literature and authors' calculations supported by expert opinion. Quantities for resource inputs came from the literature and from expert opinion; prices came from the WHO-CHOICE database. METHODS: Costs were assessed in year 2000 international dollars, and effects were assessed as disability adjusted life years averted by a 10 year implementation programme. Analysis was restricted to sub-Saharan regions where the most deadly form of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, is most prevalent. The impact on population health for various interventions, and their combinations, was evaluated at selected coverage levels by using a state-transition model. Sensitivity analysis was done for age weights and discounting. RESULTS: High coverage with artemisinin based combination treatments was found to be the most cost effective strategy for control of malaria in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: A much larger infusion of resources than those currently available is needed to make headway in the fight to roll back malaria. On cost effectiveness grounds, in most areas in sub-Saharan Africa greater coverage with highly effective combination treatments should be the cornerstone of malaria control.

DESIGN: Generalised cost effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Efficacy data came from the literature and authors' calculations supported by expert opinion. Quantities for resource inputs came from the literature and from expert opinion; prices came from the WHO-CHOICE database. METHODS: Costs were assessed in year 2000 international dollars, and effects were assessed as disability adjusted life years averted by a 10 year implementation programme. Analysis was restricted to sub-Saharan regions where the most deadly form of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, is most prevalent. The impact on population health for various interventions, and their combinations, was evaluated at selected coverage levels by using a state-transition model.

26193,Cost effectiveness analysis of strategies to combat malaria in developing countries,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of selected malaria control interventions in the context of reaching the millennium development goals for malaria. DESIGN: Generalised cost effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Efficacy data came from the literature and authors' calculations supported by expert opinion. Quantities for resource inputs came from the literature and from expert opinion; prices came from the WHO-CHOICE database. METHODS: Costs were assessed in year 2000 international dollars, and effects were assessed as disability adjusted life years averted by a 10 year implementation programme. Analysis was restricted to sub-Saharan regions where the most deadly form of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, is most prevalent. The impact on population health for various interventions, and their combinations, was evaluated at selected coverage levels by using a state-transition model. Sensitivity analysis was done for age weights and discounting. RESULTS: High coverage with artemisinin based combination treatments was found to be the most cost effective strategy for control of malaria in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
