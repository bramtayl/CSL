501,A cost-utility analysis of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. Docetaxel versus paclitaxel versus vinorelbine,"The aim of this study was to determine the incremental effectiveness, the incremental health-related quality of life (differences in quality-adjusted progression-free survival between treatments), the incremental cost and the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios, for docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine, when these drugs were used as second-line treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In the absence of comparative direct evidence of the relative efficacy of docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine in this setting, a model was designed to determine the effects of the 3 interventions on health outcome and cost. A Markov process model, based on 53 disease states, was thus constructed to evaluate the socioeconomics of the 3 treatment regimens. The model allows assessments from the start of second-line chemotherapy until death. Costs were evaluated from the combined view of the healthcare system and the patient. Direct nonmedical and indirect costs were excluded. Consumption per episode of care was estimated by retrospective analysis of 153 medical reports from 5 different hospitals. Hospital costs were allocated values from the national accounting costs by diagnosis-related group (DRG). The content of the health states was based on the multiattribute health states classification system (MASH). Preference values were assigned by application of a standard reference lottery using 20 oncological nurses as proxies for the patients. The health-related quality-of-life score was used as a quality adjustment weighting factor to calculate quality-adjusted progression-free survival associated with the 3 different regimens. Docetaxel reduces the time spent in progression, decreases the number of complications due to progressive disease and thereby provides better quality of life. It provides a benefit of 57 disease- and discomfort-free days compared with vinorelbine and 22 days compared with paclitaxel. Docetaxel may be thought of as self-financing as a result of savings in hospital admissions, providing net savings of 6800 French francs (FF; 1993 values) compared with expenditure associated with vinorelbine treatment and FF700 compared with the equivalent figures for paclitaxel.",1996-01-01884,10169397,Pharmacoeconomics,R Launois,1996,10 / 5,504-21,Yes,10169397,"R Launois; J Reboul-Marty; B Henry; J Bonneterre; A cost-utility analysis of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.

502,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae invasive diseases in France,"A cost-effectiveness analysis of a vaccination program against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) was conducted using French epidemiological data. The vaccine would be added as a fifth valence to the tetravalent vaccines (DTCP) widely used in France. The permanent sequelae of the Hib invasive diseases which might be avoided by vaccination were weighted to determine Quality Adjusted Life Years gained. In a stable French population of 3,746,000 children aged < 5 years old (1990), and for a followup period of ten years, the cost-effectiveness ratio of such a program for the French national health insurance system would equal 54,084 FF per year of life added or 34,050 FF per QALY. The net cost of the program during that period would be 1.02 billion FF for the French national health insurance system and 920 million FF for patients' families. Comparison of these projections with available information supports, a posteriori, the decision of the French government to authorize the licensing of the pentavalent vaccine.",1996-01-01885,8782346,Vaccine,A Livartowski,1996,14 / 6,495-500,Yes,8782346,"A Livartowski; J Boucher; B Detournay; P Reinert; Cost-effectiveness evaluation of vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae invasive diseases in France, Vaccine, 1996-Apr; 14(6):1873-2518; 495-500",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Polysaccharide-tetanus toxoid (PRP-T) conjugate Hib vaccine vs. No Hib vaccination,Not Stated,5 Years,5 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,6.00,6.00,64688,France,1993,20469.56
503,Cost-effectiveness of lumbar discectomy for the treatment of herniated intervertebral disc,"STUDY DESIGN. A cost-effectiveness analysis of lumbar discectomy based on existing efficacy data and newly gathered cost data. OBJECTIVES. For patients with herniated lumbar discs unresponsive to conservative management, surgery relieves pain more rapidly but at higher costs than continued medical therapy. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of lumbar discectomy for these patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. Effectiveness estimates were based on the results of a published trial of 126 herniated disc patients randomized to surgical or nonsurgical treatment. Quality of life values were based on a study of 83 subjects with low back pain. Treatment costs for herniated discs were estimated from insurance data for 372 patients treated surgically and 1,803 treated medically. METHODS. Efficacy results were weighted by quality of life values to estimate the quality-adjusted benefit of surgery. Cost-effectiveness was calculated in dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained. Supplemental data sources for cost and effectiveness provided ranges for sensitivity analyses. RESULTS. Surgery increased average quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.43 years during the decade following treatment, a benefit similar to extending a healthy life by 5 months. Reimbursements for surgical patients were $12,550 more than for medical patients. Nondiscounted and 5% discounted cost-effectiveness were $29,200 and $33,900 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. Supplemental analyses confirmed the basecase effectiveness estimates but suggested that the cost of discectomy was overestimated. Replacing the main cost estimate with one based on HMO patients lowered discectomy's cost to $12,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSION. For carefully selected patients with herniated discs, surgical discectomy is a cost-effective treatment. Discectomy's favorable cost-effectiveness results from its substantial effect on quality of life and moderate costs.",1996-01-01886,8724089,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),A D Malter,1996,21 / 9,1048-54; discussion 1055,No,8724089,"A D Malter; E B Larson; N Urban; R A Deyo; Cost-effectiveness of lumbar discectomy for the treatment of herniated intervertebral disc, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , 1996-May-01; 21(9):1528-1159; 1048-54; discussion 1055",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,surgical discectomy vs. medical therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,5.00,33900,United States,1993,60717.6
504,Cost-effectiveness analysis of potential improvements to emergency medical services for victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To measure the incremental cost-effectiveness of various improvements to emergency medical services (EMS) systems aimed at increasing survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: We performed cost-effectiveness analysis based on (1) metaanalysis of effectiveness of the various EMS systems, (2) costing of each component of EMS systems, (3) modeling of the relationship between the proportion of cardiac arrest victims who receive CPR and the proportion of individuals trained, (4) modeling of the relationship between response time interval and the characteristics of the EMS system, (5) measurement of quality of life, and (6) decision analysis to combine the results of the first five components. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for a 48-second improvement in mean response time in a one-tier EMS system yielded by the addition of more EMS providers was $368,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). For improved response time in a two-tier EMS system by the addition of more basic life support (BLS)/BLS-defibrillator (BLS-D) providers to the first tier, the ratio was $53,000 per QALY with pump vehicles or $159,000 per QALY with ambulances.

509,Treatment costs in Hodgkin's disease: a cost-utility analysis,"The aim of this study was to estimate costs of treatment for Hodgkin's disease (HD) and the outcome in health in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and compare these to a constructed nontreatment alternative. All 55 patients treated for HD at the oncological unit of the University Hospital of Tromsø between 1985 and 1993 were included. The total treatment costs (medication, hospital stay, hospital hotel stay, radiotherapy, travelling, loss in production, i.e. work) were retrospectively estimated for all patients. In December 1994, the 49 survivors were sent a EuroQol questionnaire recording quality of life: 42 responded. The mean quality of life score was 0.78 on a 0-1 scale, and the mean total cost of treatment was pounds 12512. The total treatment costs were significantly higher in patients with advanced clinical stages of the disease (P = 0.0006), B-symptoms (fever, sweats, weight loss) (P = 0.0027) and relapse (P < 0.0001). The costs of one QALY (with production gains included and using a 10% discount rate) were estimated at pounds 1651.

510,Cost-effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy,"Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) reduces the risk of stroke in symptomatic patients with high-grade carotid stenosis. In this study, we evaluated the long-term, societal cost-benefit ratio of endarterectomy using a decision analysis model. We reviewed the results of 150 CEAs performed at an academic center and established a Markov model comparing cohorts of patients who experienced transient ischemic attacks and then underwent observation, aspirin therapy, or CEA. The cost-effectiveness of CEA was estimated using perioperative complication rates from our review and from the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial. Stroke and mortality rates were estimated from the literature. Cost estimates were based on medicare reimbursement data. Among the 150 CEAs reviewed, complications included major stroke (0.67%), minor stroke (1.33%), myocardial infarction (1.33%), pulmonary edema (0.67%), and wound hematoma (3.33%). There were no deaths or intracerebral hemorrhages. Using complication rates from our review, CEA produced cost savings of $5730.62 over the cost of observation and $3264.66 over the cost of aspirin treatment. CEA extended the average quality-adjusted life expectancy 15.8 months over that of observation and 13.2 months over that of aspirin. Substituting the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial results, CEA yielded savings of $2997.50 over the cost of observation and $531.54 over the cost of aspirin. Quality-adjusted life expectancy was extended 13.8 months compared with observation and 11.2 months compared with aspirin therapy.

512,A cost-utility analysis of second-line antibiotics in the treatment of acute otitis media in children,"Newer antibiotics have higher acquisition costs than the first-line antibiotics but may offer superior outcomes, including enhanced eradication of resistant organisms, safety, and compliance in the treatment of acute otitis media. A rational choice among differing therapies should systematically address all these factors. We conducted a cost-utility analysis to compare the commonly used second-line antibiotics--cefaclor (CEF), amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMX-CLA), and erythromycin-sulfisoxazole (ERY-SULF). A meta-analysis of comparative clinical trials was performed to derive point estimates with a 95% confidence interval for rates of success and adverse events. Costs for drugs, laboratory tests, and physician visits were obtained from the government formulary and fee schedules. The cost for management of adverse events was estimated from the findings of a survey of pediatricians. Utilities (preferences or ratings of health states) were derived from responses of physicians to a standardized scenario of acute otitis media with combinations of adverse events. These utilities were used to obtain quality-adjusted life-day (QALD) scores over a 30-day horizon as a measure of effectiveness. Overall cost and QALD were calculated using decision analytic modeling. CEF performed significantly better than the two other drug treatments with the lowest expected cost ($108.00) and highest outcome (28.15 QALD); AMX-CLA was second in cost and third in outcome ($119.00, 27.98 QALD); and ERY-SULF was third in cost and second in outcome ($120.00, 28.03 QALD).

513,A cost-utility analysis of second-line antibiotics in the treatment of acute otitis media in children,"Newer antibiotics have higher acquisition costs than the first-line antibiotics but may offer superior outcomes, including enhanced eradication of resistant organisms, safety, and compliance in the treatment of acute otitis media. A rational choice among differing therapies should systematically address all these factors. We conducted a cost-utility analysis to compare the commonly used second-line antibiotics--cefaclor (CEF), amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMX-CLA), and erythromycin-sulfisoxazole (ERY-SULF). A meta-analysis of comparative clinical trials was performed to derive point estimates with a 95% confidence interval for rates of success and adverse events. Costs for drugs, laboratory tests, and physician visits were obtained from the government formulary and fee schedules. The cost for management of adverse events was estimated from the findings of a survey of pediatricians. Utilities (preferences or ratings of health states) were derived from responses of physicians to a standardized scenario of acute otitis media with combinations of adverse events. These utilities were used to obtain quality-adjusted life-day (QALD) scores over a 30-day horizon as a measure of effectiveness. Overall cost and QALD were calculated using decision analytic modeling. CEF performed significantly better than the two other drug treatments with the lowest expected cost ($108.00) and highest outcome (28.15 QALD); AMX-CLA was second in cost and third in outcome ($119.00, 27.98 QALD); and ERY-SULF was third in cost and second in outcome ($120.00, 28.03 QALD).

The cost-utility of HPN and factors affecting the cost-utility ratio were examined to determine whether current practice is the most efficient way of treating intestinal failure. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were measured using a validated health status questionnaire. The cost of treating a patient with intestinal failure was calculated, and marginal cost per QALY gained ratios were obtained. The cost per QALY for an average patient was approximately 68,975 pounds, but the value for patients over 55 years of age of about 126,865 pounds compared with approximately 58,233 pounds for those under 44 years.

517,Screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm: a computer assisted cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of introducing routine ultrasonic screening for the identification and elective surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) at high risk of rupture in the U.K. population of men aged 65-74 years. DESIGN: A computer assisted simulation of an AAA screening programme. The simulation incorporated assumptions gleaned from the literature about the epidemiology of AAA and the costs of screening. In addition, up-to-date costings based on recent Manchester (U.K.) vascular surgery experience are used. SETTING: A dialogue between National Health Service commissioners and providers to explore the feasibility and desirability of introducing AAA screening. CHIEF OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. MAIN RESULTS: The absolute cost (circa 1992/3) per QALY gained from screening for and treating aneurysms of > or = 6 cm in diameter of pounds 1500 (benefit not discounted). Offsetting current treatment costs of ruptured aneurysms gives a net additional cost per QALY of pounds 1300. Screening and treating aneurysms of > or = 5 cm leads to a cost per QALY gained exceeding pounds 20000. The findings are robust under sensitivity analysis.

518,"Will increased awareness among physicians of the significance of sudden agonizing headache affect the outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage? Coventry and Warwickshire Study: audit of subarachnoid hemorrhage (establishing historical controls), hypothesis, campaign layout, and cost estimation","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The most common symptom associated with aneurysmal minor bleed (""warning leak"") is a sudden agonizing headache. Early screening of these patients may improve the outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage and may be highly cost-effective. METHODS: We conducted an extensive retrospective audit of subarachnoid hemorrhage over the last 10 years in the region of Coventry and Warwickshire, England, and initiated a continuous campaign among all physicians in the region for early neurosurgical referral of patients with sudden agonizing headache. RESULTS: Over the last 10 years the incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the region was 8.7/100 000 per year. Surgical activity was 34% and early mortality 45.2%. Functional outcome, both overall and by grade on admission, was within internationally accepted levels. Warning leak symptoms before admission were experienced by 20% of patients. These patients sought medical advice but were not referred immediately to the neurosurgical unit. CONCLUSIONS: We have established our population as valid historical controls and outlined our campaign strategy. Lowering the clinical threshold at which patients with sudden agonizing headache are screened for aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations will undoubtedly increase diagnostic costs. However, for reasons given in the text, we estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life year gain to be 1000 pounds ($1500).",1996-01-01895,8623097,Stroke,C M Tolias,1996,27 / 5,807-12,No,8623097,"C M Tolias; M S Choksey; Will increased awareness among physicians of the significance of sudden agonizing headache affect the outcome of subarachnoid hemorrhage?

519,Cost utility of the multichannel cochlear implants in 258 profoundly deaf individuals,"Cost utility analysis is a method of cost-effectiveness analysis which provides results in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Cost utility for the multichannel cochlear implant was calculated using Ontario Health Utilities Index data from 229 Nucleus 22-channel implant users and 32 cochlear implant candidates awaiting surgery. The health utility of the implanted group was greater than that of the candidate group by 0.204 (P<.0001). Use of this figure in a cost utility calculation indicates that cochlear implantation costs approximately $15,928 per QALY provided. Sensitivity analysis, a technique which systematically varies the assumptions underlying the calculations, suggests a range for the true value of between $12,000 and $30,000. This compares very favorably with other medical interventions. It is concluded that profound hearing loss has a significant effect on quality of life, and measurement of the changes that result from cochlear implant use indicates that this technology provides significant improvements and is quite cost-effective.",1996-01-01896,8667975,Laryngoscope,J R Wyatt,1996,106 / 7,816-21,No,8667975,"J R Wyatt; J K Niparko; M Rothman; G deLissovoy; Cost utility of the multichannel cochlear implants in 258 profoundly deaf individuals, Laryngoscope, 1996-Jul; 106(7):0023-852X; 816-21",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Multichannel cochlear implantation vs. No cochlear implantation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,5.00,5.00,15928,United States,1993,28528.32
520,Cost-effectiveness of clozapine monitoring after the first 6 months,"BACKGROUND: Clozapine is effective in treating patients with schizophrenia who do not respond to conventional neuroleptic drugs. The drug is unique in that it is available only with a US Food and Drug Administration-mandated system for weekly monitoring of patients' white blood cell counts. No study has been conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this mandatory monitoring system. METHODS: A benchmark case was established by utilizing cumulative incidence rates of agranulocytosis from a recent study with a large sample of clozapine-treated patients. We assumed a 20% mortality among patients with agranulocytosis, $30.61 in monitoring costs each week, and 14.4 years of remaining life expectancy after detection of agranulocytosis. Based on these bench-mark assumptions, cost-effectiveness ratios in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year were calculated for the first, second, and third 6-month periods during which a patient was receiving clozapine. Sensitivity analyses were performed with more conservative assumptions in 5 alternative scenarios. RESULTS: In the benchmark case, costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained were $61,694, $925,418, and $420,644 for the first, second, and third 6-month periods of clozapine treatment, respectively. In the alternative scenarios, these costs ranged from $7923 to $46,056 for the first 6-month period and from $54,025 to $690,850 for the second and third 6-month periods.

523,A study of the quality of life and cost-utility of renal transplantation,"The objective of this study was to assess the cost-utility of renal transplantation compared with dialysis. To accomplish this, a prospective cohort of pre-transplant patients were followed for up to two years after renal transplantation at three University-based Canadian hospitals. A total of 168 patients were followed for an average of 19.5 months after transplantation. Health-related quality of life was assessed using a hemodialysis questionnaire, a transplant questionnaire, the Sickness Impact Profile, and the Time Trade-Off Technique. Fully allocated costs were determined by prospectively recording resource use in all patients. A societal perspective was taken. By six months after transplantation, the mean health-related quality of life scores of almost all measures had improved compared to pre-transplantation, and they stayed improved throughout the two years of follow up. The mean time trade-off score was 0.57 pre-transplant and 0.70 two years after transplantation. The proportion of individuals employed increased from 30% before transplantation to 45% two years after transplantation. Employment prior to transplantation [relative risk (RR) = 23], graft function (RR 10) and age (RR 1.6 for every decrease in age by one decade), independently predicted employment status after transplantation. The cost of pre-transplant care ($66,782 Can 1994) and the cost of the first year after transplantation ($66,290) were similar. Transplantation was considerably less expensive during the second year after transplantation ($27,875). Over the two years, transplantation was both more effective and less costly than dialysis. This was true for all subgroups of patients examined, including patients older than 60 and diabetics.

524,Model of complications of NIDDM. II. Analysis of the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of treating NIDDM with the goal of normoglycemia,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the health benefits and economics of treating NIDDM with the goal of normoglycemia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Incidence-based simulation model of NIDDM was used. Hazard rates for complications were adjusted for glycemia using risk gradients from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial. Treatment costs were estimated from national survey data and clinical trials. Incremental costs and benefits were expressed in present value dollars (3% discount rate). Life-years were adjusted for quality of life, yielding quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Comprehensive treatment of NIDDM that maintains an HbA1c value of 7.2% is predicted to reduce the cumulative incidence of blindness, end-stage renal disease, and lower-extremity amputation by 72, 87, and 67%, respectively. Cardiovascular disease risk increased by 3% (no effect of treating glycemia is assumed). Life expectancy increased 1.39 years. The cost of treating hyperglycemia increased by almost twofold, which is partially offset by reductions in the cost of complications. The estimated incremental cost/QALY gained is $16,002. Treatment is more cost-effective for those with longer glycemic exposure (earlier onset of diabetes), minorities, and those with higher HbA1c under standard care. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental effectiveness of treating NIDDM with the goal of normoglycemia is estimated to be approximately $16,000/QALY gained, which is in the range of interventions that are generally considered cost-effective.",1997-01-01899,9135935,Diabetes Care,R C Eastman,1997,20 / 5,735-44,No,9135935,"R C Eastman; J C Javitt; W H Herman; E J Dasbach; C Copley-Merriman; W Maier; F Dong; D Manninen; A S Zbrozek; J Kotsanos; S A Garfield; M Harris; Model of complications of NIDDM.

525,Cost-effectiveness of expanded human immunodeficiency virus-testing protocols for donated blood,"BACKGROUND: This study was designed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of expanding the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-testing protocol for donated blood beyond screening for HIV antibodies to further reduce the risk of HIV transmission through transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of HIV antibody testing (at a cost of $5/unit) and of adding to that protocol a second HIV test, either plasma p24 antigen detection or RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (at costs of $5/unit and $8/unit, respectively). Test efficacy was projected from anticipated window-period reductions (6 days for p24 antigen, 11 days for RNA PCR), and donor seroconversion rates were derived from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study. RESULTS: On the basis of current estimates of HIV prevalence rates in blood donors (1/10,000) and 16 million annual transfusions in the United States HIV antibody testing prevents 1568 cases of transfusion-acquired HIV infection each year at a cost of $3600 per quality-adjusted year of life saved. The addition of p24 antigen testing would prevent 8 more cases at a net additional cost of $60 million annually ($2.3 million/quality-adjusted life year); RNA PCR testing would prevent 16 more cases at a net additional cost of $96 million annually ($2.0 million/ quality-adjusted life year). CONCLUSION: Although expanding the donor HIV screening protocol with p24 antigen or RNA PCR testing will prevent rare cases of transfusion-associated HIV, the cost-effectiveness of such an addition is predicted to be far below that of most medical interventions.

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of HIV antibody testing (at a cost of $5/unit) and of adding to that protocol a second HIV test, either plasma p24 antigen detection or RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (at costs of $5/unit and $8/unit, respectively). Test efficacy was projected from anticipated window-period reductions (6 days for p24 antigen, 11 days for RNA PCR), and donor seroconversion rates were derived from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study. RESULTS: On the basis of current estimates of HIV prevalence rates in blood donors (1/10,000) and 16 million annual transfusions in the United States HIV antibody testing prevents 1568 cases of transfusion-acquired HIV infection each year at a cost of $3600 per quality-adjusted year of life saved.

529,Evaluation of suspected urinary tract infection in ambulatory women: a cost-utility analysis of office-based strategies,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the most cost-effective strategy for managing suspected urinary tract infections in otherwise healthy adult women presenting to their primary care physician with dysuria and no symptoms or signs of pyelonephritis. Several office-based management strategies are considered: empiric therapy, use of dipstick analysis, use of complete urinalysis, and several strategies using office or laboratory cultures. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree using model probabilities obtained from the literature. Where published probabilities were unavailable, we used extensive sensitivity analyses. Utilities were obtained from the Index of Well-Being. We obtained costs by surveying hospitals, physicians, and pharmacies. RESULTS: The most cost-effective strategy is to treat empirically ($71.52 per quality-adjusted life month, QALM). When the cost of antibiotics exceeds $74.50 or if the prior probability of having a UTI is under 0.30, then treatment guided by the results of a complete urinalysis is preferred. While it was the preferred strategy, other strategies (complete urinalysis, culture and treat, and dipstick testing only) were associated with greater utility. The marginal cost-effectiveness of these strategies compared with empiric therapy ranged from $2964 to $48,460 per additional QALM. CONCLUSIONS: The preferred strategy of empiric therapy is robust over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. While empiric therapy is associated with the best cost-utility ratio, doing a culture yields the greatest utility at greater incremental cost per QALM. Many primary care physicians already treat UTIs empirically with antibiotics. This study confirms that empiric therapy, while frowned upon by some, is a cost-effective strategy. Other strategies may be considered, but at greater marginal cost.

530,Cost-utility analysis of contaminated appendectomy wounds,"BACKGROUND: The influence of patient preference and treatment costs has not been considered in previous analyses of wound management decisions for contaminated right lower quadrant incisions. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a decision and cost-utility analysis, conducting a MEDLINE search of the postappendectomy wound infection literature to establish assumptions and assign baseline probability estimates. Institution-specific cost data were obtained, and utility assignments were made by the authors. Studies used to assign baseline probabilities fulfilled the following criteria: perforated appendix or gangrenous appendicitis, use of perioperative antibiotics active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and data stratified by wound management, operative findings, and infection rate. RESULTS: We constructed a decision tree comparing three methods of wound management for contaminated right lower quadrant incisions: primary closure, delayed primary closure, and secondary closure. Utility (a quality of life measure) was assigned to ultimate health states to incorporate patient preference. We calculated the cost-utility for each method of wound management and found that primary closure was of optimum cost-utility compared with delayed primary closure and secondary closure. To gain one quality-adjusted life year treating a population of patients with contaminated incisions, primary closure saves $22,635 over delayed primary closure and another $22,340 over secondary closure. This decision, tested by two-way sensitivity analyses, was sensitive only to high primary closure infection rates. CONCLUSIONS: Challenging traditional surgical dogma, cost-utility analysis shows that primary closure is the favored method of management for contaminated right lower quadrant incisions.

532,Is duplex venous surveillance worthwhile after arthroplasty?,"Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) complicates 60% of knee and 80% of hip arthroplasties performed without prophylactic therapy. Routine postoperative duplex ultrasound surveillance has been proposed for the detection of venous thrombosis following arthroplasty. In order to determine whether surveillance represents an effective strategy to detect postoperative DVT when prophylaxis is used, surveillance duplex exams obtained after primary or revision hip or knee arthroplasty were analyzed using decision analysis techniques. DVT was suspected clinically after 95 of 738 (13%) arthroplasties, with no symptoms suggestive of DVT after the remaining 643 procedures.

534,Economic and health state utility determinations for schizophrenic patients treated with risperidone or haloperidol,"The current study uses utility analysis to assess economic and quality-of-life benefits of risperidone in patients with chronic schizophrenia. A retrospective analysis was performed on Positive and Negative Syndrome Symptoms (PANSS) data obtained from the published Canadian multicenter risperidone trial (part of the North American trial). Cluster analysis applied to endpoint PANSS scores, including all patients (N = 135), identified three clusters representing 130 patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptomatology. A narrative health state profile was written for each cluster, and 100 psychiatric nurses from Washington, DC, were asked to assign preference ratings to each one using linear analog and standard gamble (SG) methods. Mean utility values (confidence interval 95%) obtained from the SG ratings for the three health state profiles were 0.61 +/- 0.069 (mild); 0.36 +/- 0.073 (moderate); and 0.29 +/- 0.071 (severe). The mild health state (including the majority of risperidone 6 mg-treated patients) was rated by nurses to have a 0.25 +/- 0.0501 greater utility than the moderate health state (composed of the majority of haloperidol-treated patients). The results of these utility evaluations (SG) by the nurses were related to the clinical outcome for three of the six drug treatment groups (N = 65) by multiplying the percentage of patients in each of the three clusters, both at baseline and end-point, who were receiving risperidone 6 mg/day, haloperidol, or placebo, by the utility value for the health state assigned to that cluster. The gain in utility for risperidone-treated patients was 2.6 times higher (0.125) compared with haloperidol-treated patients (0.049), and 7 times higher compared with placebo (-0.021). After multiplying the gain in utility of each treatment by the remaining expected life span for men and women, it was found that risperidone-treated patients obtained more than twice as many quality-adjusted years as haloperidol patients. The incremental drug treatment cost divided by the incremental benefit of risperidone versus haloperidol was found to yield a favorable, generally accepted cost-utility ratio.",1997-01-01904,9241010,J Clin Psychopharmacol,G Chouinard,1997,17 / 4,298-307,No,9241010,"G Chouinard; P S Albright; Economic and health state utility determinations for schizophrenic patients treated with risperidone or haloperidol, J Clin Psychopharmacol, 1997-Aug; 17(4):0271-0749; 298-307",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Risperidone treatment (6 mg/day) vs. Haloperidol (20 mg/day) (standard treatment),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,24250,Canada,1995,30013.67
535,Cost-effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy for treating asymptomatic patients with > or = 60% internal carotid stenosis, based on outcomes reported in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS). METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using a Markov decision model in which the probabilities for base-case analysis (average age, 67 years; 66% male; perioperative stroke plus death rate, 2.3%; ipsilateral stroke rate during medical management, 2.3% per year) were based on ACAS. The model assumed that patients who had TIAs or minor strokes during medical management crossed over to surgical treatment, and used the NASCET data to model the outcome of these now-symptomatic patients. Average cost of surgery ($8500), major stroke ($34,000 plus $18,000 per year), and other costs were based on local cost determinations plus a review of the published literature. Cost-effectiveness was calculated as the incremental cost of surgery per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved when compared with medical treatment, discounting at 5% per year. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of key variables on cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, surgical treatment improved quality-adjusted life expectancy from 7.87 to 8.12 QALYs, at an incremental lifetime cost of $2041. This yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $8,000 per QALY saved by surgical compared with medical treatment. The high cost of care after major stroke during medical management largely offset the initial cost of endarterectomy in the surgical group. Furthermore, 26% of medically managed patients eventually underwent endarterectomy because of symptom development, which also decreased the cost differential. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the relative cost of surgical treatment increased substantially with increasing age, increasing perioperative stroke rate, and decreasing stroke rate during medical management. CONCLUSION: For the typical asymptomatic patient in ACAS with > or = 60% carotid stenosis, our results indicate that carotid endarterectomy is cost-effective when compared with other commonly accepted health care practices. Surgery does not appear cost-effective in very elderly patients, in settings where the operative stroke risk is high, or in patients with very low stroke risk without surgery.",1997-01-01905,9052564,J Vasc Surg,J L Cronenwett,1997,25 / 2,298-309; discussion 310-1,No,9052564,"J L Cronenwett; J D Birkmeyer; G B Nackman; M F Fillinger; F R Bech; R M Zwolak; D B Walsh; Cost-effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients, J Vasc Surg, 1997-Feb; 25(2):0741-5214; 298-309; discussion 310-1",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Carotid endarterectomy plus medical management vs. Medical management,Not Stated,67 Years,67 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,5.00,5.00,8004,United States,1996,13202.83

The Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost of improving the outcome for extremely low birthweight (ELBW, birthweight 500-999 g) infants born in Victoria after the introduction of exogenous surfactant (the post surfactant era). METHODOLOGY: This was a geographically determined cohort study of ELBW children in Victoria, Australia of consecutive livebirths born in three distinct eras: (i) 1979-80 (n = 351); (ii) 1985-87 (n = 560); and (iii) 1991-92 (n = 429). Exogenous surfactant was first used in Victoria in March, 1991. The consumption of nursery resources per livebirth, and the survival and sensorineural disability rates at 2 years of age for each era were investigated. Utilities were assigned as follows: 0 for dead, 0.4 for severe disability, 0.6 for moderate disability, 0.8 for mild disability, and 1 for no disability. Utilities were multiplied for more than one disability. Dollar costs were assumed to be $1470 ($A 1992) per day of assisted ventilation, and one dose of exogenous surfactant was assumed to be equivalent to one third of a day of assisted ventilation. Cost-effectiveness (additional costs per additional survivor or life-year gained) and cost-utility (additional costs per additional quality-adjusted survivor or life-year gained) ratios were calculated for the pre-surfactant era (1985-87 vs 1979-80), and for the post surfactant era (1991-92 vs 1985-87). RESULTS: Considering only the costs incurred during the primary hospitalization, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were lower (i.e. economically better) in the post surfactant era than in the pre-surfactant era (pre-surfactant vs post surfactant; $7040 vs $4040 per life year gained; $6700 vs $5360 per quality-adjusted life year gained).

538,Evaluation of the dyspeptic patient: a cost-utility study,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, patients presenting with uncomplicated dyspepsia have been managed using empiric antisecretory therapy, followed by endoscopy in the event of persistent symptoms or complication. Since Helicobacter pylori is now accepted as an important and potentially reversible cause of ulcer disease, it is important to reevaluate the management of dyspepsia. The goal of this study is to evaluate seven outpatient strategies for the management of dyspeptic patients using a cost-utility analysis. METHODS: The study design was that of a cost-utility analysis. The model assumes that an adult patient with signs of dyspepsia but no signs of complication presents to the outpatient office of a primary care physician. Seven strategies are modeled: empiric antisecretory therapy; empiric H pylori eradication using oral omeprazole (20 mg [corrected] twice daily), clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily), and amoxicillin (1000 mg twice daily); use of either upper endoscopy, an upper gastrointestinal barium study (an upper GI), or the serum titer for H pylori as a diagnostic test to identify patients for H pylori eradication; or use of an initial diagnostic test followed by the serum titer for H pylori. The primary outcome was the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for each strategy for a 1-year period from presentation; secondary outcomes included the probability of symptomatic ulcer recurrence, cost per ulcer cure, and mortality. RESULTS: Three strategies were similarly cost-effective: empiric H pylori eradication ($1198 per QALY), use of a serum H pylori titer as an initial diagnostic test ($1214 per QALY), and empiric antisecretory therapy ($1288 per QALY). Empiric antisecretory therapy, however, was associated with significantly more symptomatic ulcer recurrences and deaths than any other strategy. CONCLUSIONS: This cost-utility analysis suggests that two strategies are reasonable for patients presenting with dyspepsia: (1) empiric H pylori eradication and (2) use of a serum H pylori titer to identify patients who might benefit from H pylori eradication.

543,The cost-effectiveness of air bags by seating position,"CONTEXT: Motor vehicle crashes continue to cause significant mortality and morbidity in the United States. Installation of air bags in new passenger vehicles is a major initiative in the field of injury prevention. OBJECTIVE: To assess the net health consequences and cost-effectiveness of driver's side and front passenger air bags from a societal perspective, taking into account the increased risk to children who occupy the front passenger seat and the diminished effectiveness for older adults. DESIGN: A deterministic state transition model tracked a hypothetical cohort of new vehicles over a 20-year period for 3 strategies: (1) installation of safety belts, (2) installation of driver's side air bags in addition to safety belts, and (3) installation of front passenger air bags in addition to safety belts and driver's side air bags. Changes in health outcomes, valued in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs (in 1993 dollars), were projected following the recommendations of the Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine. PARTICIPANTS: US population-based and convenience sample data were used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Safety belts are cost saving, even at 50% use. The addition of driver's side air bags to safety belts results in net health benefits at an incremental cost of $24000 per QALY saved. The further addition of front passenger air bags results in an incremental net benefit at a higher incremental cost of $61000 per QALY saved. Results were sensitive to the unit cost of air bag systems, their effectiveness, baseline fatality rates, the ratio of injuries to fatalities, and the real discount rate.

545,Outcomes and cost-effectiveness of initiating dialysis and continuing aggressive care in seriously ill hospitalized adults. SUPPORT Investigators. Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments,"BACKGROUND: Renal failure requiring dialysis in the setting of hospitalization for serious illness is a poor prognostic sign, and dialysis and aggressive care are sometimes withheld. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of initiating dialysis and continuing aggressive care for seriously ill hospitalized patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study and cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Five geographically diverse teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: 490 patients (median age, 61 years; 58% women) enrolled in the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) in whom dialysis was initiated. MEASUREMENTS: Survival, functional status, quality of life, and health care costs. Life expectancy was estimated by extrapolating survival data (up to 4.4 years of follow-up) using a declining exponential function. Utilities (quality-of-life weights) were estimated by using time-tradeoff questions. Costs were based on data from SUPPORT and published Medicare data. RESULTS: Median duration of survival was 32 days, and only 27% of patients were alive after 5 months. Survivors reported a median of one dependency in activities of daily living, and 62% rated their quality of life as ""good"" or better. Overall, the estimated cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved by initiating dialysis and continuing aggressive care rather than withholding dialysis and allowing death to occur was $128,200. For the 103 patients in the worst prognostic category, the estimated cost per quality-adjusted life-year was $274,100; for the 94 patients in the best prognostic category, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year was $61,900. CONCLUSIONS: For the few patients who survived, clinical outcomes were fairly good. With the exception of patients with the best prognoses, however, the cost-effectiveness of initiating dialysis and continuing aggressive care far exceeded $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, a commonly cited threshold for cost-effective care.",1997-01-01910,9245224,Ann Intern Med,M B Hamel,1997,127 / 3,195-202,No,9245224,"M B Hamel; R S Phillips; R B Davis; N Desbiens; A F Connors; J M Teno; N Wenger; J Lynn; A W Wu; W Fulkerson; J Tsevat; Outcomes and cost-effectiveness of initiating dialysis and continuing aggressive care in seriously ill hospitalized adults.

546,Choice of long-term strategy for the management of patients with severe esophagitis: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Omeprazole has shown remarkable efficacy and safety in the treatment of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); similarly, laparoscopic techniques have allowed less morbidity in patients undergoing fundoplication procedures. Concerns about the long-term cost and safety of both strategies have prompted a debate of their role in long-term management of patients with severe erosive esophagitis. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed to compare two strategies: laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) vs. omeprazole. A two-stage Markov model was used to obtain cost and efficacy estimates; all estimates were discounted at 3% per year. The time horizon was 5 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all relevant variables. RESULTS: Both strategies were similarly effective (4.33 quality-adjusted life years per patient), with omeprazole less expensive than LNF ($6053 vs. $9482 per patient). At 10 years, LNF and omeprazole costs were similar. Efficacy estimates were extremely sensitive to changes in quality of life associated with postoperative symptoms and long-term use of medication. CONCLUSIONS: Medical therapy is the preferred treatment strategy for most patients with severe erosive esophagitis. Individuals with a long life expectancy are good candidates for LNF if postoperative morbidity is low and GERD symptoms remain abated for many years.",1997-01-01911,9097989,Gastroenterology,G R Heudebert,1997,112 / 4,1078-86,No,9097989,"G R Heudebert; R Marks; C M Wilcox; R M Centor; Choice of long-term strategy for the management of patients with severe esophagitis: a cost-utility analysis, Gastroenterology, 1997-Apr; 112(4):0016-5085; 1078-86",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,surgical strategy vs. medical strategy,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Male,Full,Not Stated,3.00,3.00,1691500,United States,1996,2790177.22
547,Economic analysis of adjuvant interferon alfa-2b in high-risk melanoma based on projections from Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 1684,"PURPOSE: Interferon alfa-2b (IFN) in a randomized clinical trial (E1684) prolonged relapse-free and total survival in high-risk resected melanoma. However, the costs and toxicities of IFN are barriers to its widespread use. This study was undertaken to analyze the projected costs and long-term benefits of IFN by combining prospectively collected data on IFN actual dosage, time of recurrence, and survival with secondary data on long-term melanoma recurrence risks to project the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant IFN compared with observation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hypothetical cohorts of 50-year-old melanoma patients whose mean IFN dosage and clinical results were directly taken from E1684 were included in the study. Melanoma recurrence risks beyond 5 years were derived from international databases. Melanoma recurrence care costs and quality-of-life adjustments, when considered, were based on expert consensus. End points were incremental costs, life-years gained, and cost per life-year gained with and without quality-of-life adjustments. RESULTS: The IFN cohort was projected to have an increased (undiscounted) survival of 0.52 years at 7 years and 1.90 years over a lifetime. The projected incremental cost (in 1996 United States dollars) per life-year gained in the IFN cohort ranged from $13,700 after 35 years to $32,600 at 7 years, the median follow-up of E1684. Using assigned quality-of-life values for IFN and recurrence, the lifetime cost per quality adjusted life-year increased to $15,200. Even if treatment costs for recurrence were excluded, the lifetime incremental cost per life-year gained was $21,600. CONCLUSION: The cost and toxicity of IFN must be balanced against its projected benefits in high-risk melanoma.

548,"Effect of screening for cancer in the Nordic countries on deaths, cost and quality of life up to the year 2017","The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of screening for cancer in the Nordic countries. There is sufficient scientific evidence to conclude that screening for cervical cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer will result in a reduction in mortality. The effects on mortality were predicted for the future up to the year 2017 assuming that the Nordic countries are covered by screening as a nation-wide population-based public health policy and comparing the predicted mortality trends with those assuming no screening programmes. For cervical cancer the programme as practised in Finland was used as a point of reference. For breast cancer and for colorectal cancer the results of randomized preventive trials were assumed in the absence of detailed results based on any public health policy, i.e., a reduction of 30% in mortality from breast cancer and 20% in mortality from colorectal cancer. The assumed ages and frequencies of screening ranged from 25 to 59 years at 5-year intervals for cervical cancer, from 50 to 69 at 2-year intervals for breast cancer and annual screening from 50 to 74 years for colorectal cancer. Data on incidence and incidence predicted up to the year 2012, mortality, survival and size of the general population were employed in the estimation. Age-cohort and age-period-cohort log-linear models were applied in predicting future mortality rates with and without screening. The choice of the models depended on the age distribution of deaths from each particular site of cancer, on changes in public health policy, such as establishment of mass-screening, and on the goodness of fit of the model. The screening policy assumed would result in 1600 annual deaths prevented out of the potential 13,600 deaths in the Nordic countries in 1995, corresponding to 11% of the deaths from the three primary sites. Only after the year 2010 will the ultimate effect of such a screening policy have as full an effect and in 2013-2017 the annual number of cancer deaths prevented will be 3900 out of 15,000 potential deaths, i.e., a 26% reduction. This is equal to 5.7% of all cancer deaths in the Nordic countries in 2013-2017 (2.0% for males and 9.7% for females). The predicted numbers of annual deaths prevented in 2013-2017 are 1500 for cervical cancer, 1000 for breast cancer and 1500 for colorectal cancer. Most (91%) of the cervical cancers can be prevented, whereas the proportion of breast cancer deaths (18%) and colorectal cancer deaths (18%) prevented will be much smaller. Costs of the screening programmes were estimated taking into consideration the direct costs of screening and savings from advanced disease treatment and terminal care. The total cost of screening for cervical, breast and colorectal cancer in the Nordic countries in the year 2010 is estimated to be $111 m. Cervical cancer screening is estimated to save $17 m yearly in the period 2008-2012. Screening for cervical cancer is approaching a phase when both the effect and costs are relatively stable and it was estimated to be cost-saving. The effect of screening for breast and colorectal cancers is expected to become apparent gradually during the predicted period due to the increasing number (and percentage) of patients diagnosed by screening. When the screening programmes are assumed to achieve the optimal effect, the reduction in mortality will increase and treatment costs fall, resulting in a substantial decrease in the cost-effectiveness ratio. In the last considered period (2008-2012) the costs per life year gained (breast cancer $15,400, colorectal cancer $5700) are approximately one half of those at the onset of screening. The differences in the costs per LYG were relatively small between the Nordic countries and mainly dependent on the differences in baseline risk of cancer. The total cost of the three screening programmes was estimated at $4400 per life years gained in the year 2010.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",1997-01-01913,9143316,Acta Oncol,L Hristova,1997,36 Suppl 9 /,1-60,No,9143316,"L Hristova; M Hakama; Effect of screening for cancer in the Nordic countries on deaths, cost and quality of life up to the year 2017, Acta Oncol, 1997; 36 Suppl 9():0284-186X; 1-60",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,universal screening program vs. no screening program,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,4515,United States,1996,7447.62
549,Intraoperative autologous transfusion during elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction: a decision analysis model,"PURPOSE: The use of intraoperative autologous transfusion devices expanded during the last decade as a result of the increased awareness of transfusion-associated complications. This study was designed to determine whether routine use of an intraoperative autologous transfusion device (Haemonetics Cell Saver [CS]) during elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions is cost-effective ($50,000/QALYs threshold). METHODS: A decision analysis tree was constructed to model all of the complications that are associated with red blood cell replacement during aortic reconstructions for both abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD). It was assumed that a unit of CS return (CSR; 250 ml/unit) equaled a unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and that all CS transfusions were necessary. Transfusion requirements (AAA:PRBC = 2.8 +/- 3.2 units, CSB = 3.7 +/- 3.2 units; AIOD:PRBC = 3.1 +/- 3.0 units, CSR = 2.1 +/- 1.7 units) were determined from retrospective review of all elective aortic reconstructions (AAA, N = 63; AIOD, N = 75) from Jan. 1991 to June 1995 in which the CS was used (82.1% of all reconstructions). Risk of allogenic transfusion-related complications (transfusion reaction, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II) and their associated treatment costs (expressed in dollars and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained from the medical literature, institutional audit, and a consensus of physicians. RESULTS: Routine use of the CS during elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions was not cost-effective in our practice. Use during reconstructions for AAA repairs cost $263.75 but added only 0.00218 QALYs, for a rate of $120,794/QALY. Use during reconstructions for AIOD was even more costly at $356.68 and provided even less benefit at 0.00062 QALYs, for a rate of $578,275/QALY. The sensitivity analyses determined that the routine use of the CS would be cost-effective in our practice only for AAA repairs if the incidence of hepatitis C were tenfold greater than the baseline assumption. The model determined that CS was cost-effective if the CSR exceed 5 units during reconstructions for AAA and 6 units during reconstructions for AIOD. CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of the CS during elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions is not cost-effective. The use of the device should be reserved for a select group of aortic reconstructions, including those in which cost-effective salvage volumes are anticipated. Alternatively, the CS should be used as a reservoir and activated as a salvage device if significant bleeding is encountered.",1997-01-01914,9201158,J Vasc Surg,T S Huber,1997,25 / 6,984-93; discussion 993-4,No,9201158,"T S Huber; S P McGorray; L C Carlton; P B Irwin; R R Flug; T C Flynn; J M Seeger; Intraoperative autologous transfusion during elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction: a decision analysis model, J Vasc Surg, 1997-Jun; 25(6):0741-5214; 984-93; discussion 993-4",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine use of intraoperative autologous transfusion device vs. No use of intraoperative autologous transfusion device,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,5.00,Not Stated,120794,United States,1996,199253.13

Transfusion requirements (AAA:PRBC = 2.8 +/- 3.2 units, CSB = 3.7 +/- 3.2 units; AIOD:PRBC = 3.1 +/- 3.0 units, CSR = 2.1 +/- 1.7 units) were determined from retrospective review of all elective aortic reconstructions (AAA, N = 63; AIOD, N = 75) from Jan. 1991 to June 1995 in which the CS was used (82.1% of all reconstructions). Risk of allogenic transfusion-related complications (transfusion reaction, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II) and their associated treatment costs (expressed in dollars and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained from the medical literature, institutional audit, and a consensus of physicians. RESULTS: Routine use of the CS during elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions was not cost-effective in our practice. Use during reconstructions for AAA repairs cost $263.75 but added only 0.00218 QALYs, for a rate of $120,794/QALY. Use during reconstructions for AIOD was even more costly at $356.68 and provided even less benefit at 0.00062 QALYs, for a rate of $578,275/QALY. The sensitivity analyses determined that the routine use of the CS would be cost-effective in our practice only for AAA repairs if the incidence of hepatitis C were tenfold greater than the baseline assumption. The model determined that CS was cost-effective if the CSR exceed 5 units during reconstructions for AAA and 6 units during reconstructions for AIOD. CONCLUSIONS: The routine use of the CS during elective infrarenal aortic reconstructions is not cost-effective. The use of the device should be reserved for a select group of aortic reconstructions, including those in which cost-effective salvage volumes are anticipated. Alternatively, the CS should be used as a reservoir and activated as a salvage device if significant bleeding is encountered.",1997-01-01914,9201158,J Vasc Surg,T S Huber,1997,25 / 6,984-93; discussion 993-4,No,9201158,"T S Huber; S P McGorray; L C Carlton; P B Irwin; R R Flug; T C Flynn; J M Seeger; Intraoperative autologous transfusion during elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction: a decision analysis model, J Vasc Surg, 1997-Jun; 25(6):0741-5214; 984-93; discussion 993-4",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine use of intraoperative autologous transfusion device vs. No use of intraoperative autologous transfusion device,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,5.00,Not Stated,578275,United States,1996,953881.01
551,An economic analysis of the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Study. Application to the United Kingdom,"Recent studies have shown that ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). While these trials have obvious clinical implications, the widespread introduction of a new treatment for a condition as common as MI also has clear cost implications. The results of the post-MI studies with ACE inhibitors suggest that restricted use of treatment-in high-risk patients-is likely to be most cost effective, whereas treatment of all MI survivors, many of whom are at low risk, will be least cost effective. An approach somewhere in between may maximise clinical benefit at an acceptable cost. Economic analysis may help in deciding how these drugs might be best used after MI. We have conducted a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) study, which reported the benefit of ACE inhibitors in intermediate-risk patients. Assuming all MI survivors require measurement of left ventricular function before selection for treatment (the approach used in the SAVE study), the incremental cost per life-year gained (LYG), over 4 years, using prophylactic captopril is approximately 10000 pounds sterling (Pounds) [1994 to 1995 values]. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) is similar. These incremental cost per LYG and cost per QALY ratios compare favourably with other commonly used symptomatic and prophylactic treatments, and argue for extending post-MI use of ACE inhibitors to intermediate-as well as high-risk patients.",1997-01-01915,10169670,Pharmacoeconomics,S Hummel,1997,12 / 2 Pt 1,182-92,Yes,10169670,"S Hummel; J Piercy; R Wright; A Davie; A Bagust; J McMurray; An economic analysis of the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) Study.

552,A cost-effectiveness analysis of anterior temporal lobectomy for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy,"Patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy are potential candidates for anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL), in which epileptogenic temporal lobe tissue is localized and surgically removed. This surgical approach can eliminate or drastically reduce seizures in the majority of patients. The authors used a decision-analysis model to examine the cost-effectiveness of a surgical evaluation and treatment protocol for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy. This model compared a cohort treated with the new protocol with a continuation of their immediate preoperative medical management and projected these differences over the patient's lifetime. The Markov model incorporated postoperative seizure status, patient quality of life, death from surgical and natural causes, discounting, and the direct medical costs associated with outpatient evaluation, hospitalization, surgery, antiepileptic drugs, and lifetime outpatient treatment. The intent-to-treat analysis included patients who underwent evaluation but were not eligible for ATL. Sensitivity analyses were also performed on the variables in the model. Data from the baseline model indicated that evaluation for ATL provided an average of 1.1 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with continued medical management, at an additional cost of $29,800. Combining the clinical and economic outcomes yielded a cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,200 per QALY. This value is comparable to other accepted medical or surgical interventions, such as total knee arthroplasty ($16,700/QALY) or coronary artery balloon angioplasty ($40,800/QALY). Sensitivity analyses demonstrate that the results are critically dependent on postoperative seizure status and improvement in quality of life. Although further work is necessary to quantify the improvement in quality of life after epilepsy surgery better, the present data indicate that ATL for treatment of intractable temporal lobe epilepsy is a cost-effective use of medical resources.",1997-01-01916,9202260,J Neurosurg,J T King,1997,87 / 1,20-8,No,9202260,"J T King; M R Sperling; A C Justice; M J O'Connor; A cost-effectiveness analysis of anterior temporal lobectomy for intractable temporal lobe epilepsy, J Neurosurg, 1997-Jul; 87(1):0022-3085; 20-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) if resectable seizure foci discovered vs. Continued medical therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,27200,United States,1994,47501.07
553,Cost-effectiveness of anterotemporal lobectomy in medically intractable complex partial epilepsy,"PURPOSE: The value of high-cost health technologies is being increasingly scrutinized by providers of health care. An understanding of the costs and outcomes of high-technology epilepsy care is required to ensure efficient resource allocation. METHODS: Decision analysis was used to estimate the cost effectiveness of anterotemporal lobectomy (ATL) as compared with standard medical management in medically-intractable epilepsy. Local (Rochester, NY, U.S.A.) cost data were applied to a model of lifetime discounted costs and outcomes of evaluation, ATL, and follow-up in a hypothetical cohort of patients. RESULTS: Base case analysis yielded a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (MECR) of $15.581/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Extensive sensitivity analyses identified extreme conditions in which evaluation for ATL was dominant (more effective and less costly) or in which it might be considered not worth the cost (MCER > $50,000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Estimates of ATL cost effectiveness fall within a generally acceptable range, even when uncertainty about many model parameters is taken into account. Under assumptions based on available data in the literature, the cost effectiveness of ATL compares favorably with that of other health technologies. Prospective multicenter studies of regional-cost and practice variations; long-term probabilities of year-to-year transitions between seizure outcome states and their effects on quality of life (QOL), and the effect of nonsurgical treatments on seizure control and QOL are needed to provide the critical data to confirm and constrain these estimates.",1997-01-01917,9048666,Epilepsia,J T Langfitt,1997,38 / 2,154-63,No,9048666,"J T Langfitt; Cost-effectiveness of anterotemporal lobectomy in medically intractable complex partial epilepsy, Epilepsia, 1997-Feb; 38(2):0013-9580; 154-63",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Evaluation for anterotemporal lobectomy (ATL), with ATL if appropriate vs. Continued medical management with standard anti-epileptic drugs",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,15581,United States,1995,26460.2
554,Cost-effectiveness of screening for carotid stenosis in asymptomatic persons,"BACKGROUND: The Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) showed that carotid endarterectomy was beneficial for symptom-free patients with carotid stenosis of 60% or more. This finding raises the question of whether widespread screening to identify cases of asymptomatic carotid stenosis should be implemented. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a screening program to identify cases of asymptomatic carotid stenosis would be a cost-effective strategy for stroke prevention. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using published data from clinical trials. SETTING: General population of asymptomatic 65-year-old men. INTERVENTION: Patients who were screened for carotid disease with duplex Doppler ultrasonography were compared with patients who were not screened. If ultrasonography found significant carotid stenosis (> or = 60%), disease was confirmed by angiography before carotid endarterectomy was done. MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life-years, costs, and marginal cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: When the conditions and results of ACAS were modeled and it was assumed that the survival advantage produced by endarterectomy would last for 30 years, the lifetime marginal cost-effectiveness of screening relative to no screening was $120,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analysis showed that marginal cost-effectiveness decreased to $50,000 or less per quality-adjusted life-year only under implausible conditions (for example, if a free screening instrument with perfect test characteristics was used or an asymptomatic population with a 40% prevalence of carotid stenosis was found). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery offers a real but modest absolute reduction in the rate of stroke at a substantial cost.

555,Cost-effectiveness of interferon alfa in chronic myelogenous leukemia,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interferon alfa (IFN alpha) treatment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia relative to conventional chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analysis model that involved a multistate Markov process was designed to estimate the expected cost and quality-adjusted life expectancies for two cohorts of patients to be administered conventional chemotherapy or IFN alpha. Two IFN alpha strategies were modeled: prolonged treatment for patients who achieved a hematologic response (scenario A) or only for patients who achieved a cytogenetic remission in a 2-year period (scenario B). Data on response and transition probabilities between health states were obtained from the literature by a MEDLINE search and pooled with a meta-analytic method. Costs were based on local charges. Expected survival was adjusted for quality of life on the basis of an expert panel judgment. RESULTS: Baseline analysis showed IFN alpha treatment to increase the quality-adjusted life expectancy by 15.5 and 12.5 months relative to conventional chemotherapy, in scenarios A and B, respectively. Marginal cost-effectiveness was $89,500 and $63,500 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analysis confirmed IFN alpha as the most effective approach. Cost-effectiveness results were sensitive to the cost of IFN alpha therapy and to the assumptions about the rate of cytogenetic remission. Reducing the drug dose, as suggested by a recent report, would decrease the marginal cost-effectiveness to less than $20,000. CONCLUSION: IFN alpha is substantially superior to conventional chemotherapy in terms of quality-adjusted survival, but, at the current doses, marginal cost-effectiveness ranges from $50,000 to $100,000 per QALY gained under most of our assumptions.",1997-01-01919,9215840,J Clin Oncol,N L Liberato,1997,15 / 7,2673-82,No,9215840,"N L Liberato; S Quaglini; G Barosi; Cost-effectiveness of interferon alfa in chronic myelogenous leukemia, J Clin Oncol, 1997-Jul; 15(7):0732-183X; 2673-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Interferon alfa therapy vs. Conventional chemotherapy,Not Stated,50 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,5.00,5.00,89494.46,United States,1995,151982.62
556,The cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging for patients with equivocal neurological symptoms,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) in young adults presenting with equivocal neurological signs and symptoms. DESIGNS AND METHODS: A decision analysis of long-term survival using accuracy data from a diagnostic technology assessment of MRI and CT in patients with suspected multiple sclerosis, information from the medical literature, and clinical assumptions. MAIN RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, at 30% likelihood of an underlying neurologic disease, MRI use has an incremental cost of $101,670 for each additional quality-adjusted life-year saved compared with $20,290 for CT use. As the probability of disease increases, further MRI use becomes a cost-effective alternative costing $30,000 for each quality-adjusted life-year saved. If a negative MRI result provides reassurance, the incremental costs of immediate MRI use decreases and falls below $25,000 for each quality-adjusted life-year saved no matter the likelihood of disease. CONCLUSIONS: For most individuals with neurological symptoms or signs, CT imaging is cost-effective while MR imaging is not.

It also provides a methodology for transforming complex quality-of-life profiles into a single index value on the conventional 0 to 1 quality-adjusted life-year scale (QALY). From 1990 to 1992, 583 patients with newly diagnosed, symptomatic multiple myeloma were enrolled in a randomised, multicentre, phase III study to evaluate the addition of interferon-alpha 2b to treatment with melphalan and prednisone. Addition of interferon-alpha 2b yielded a 12% increase in median survival time, at the expense of a slight reduction in quality of life during the first year of treatment. The gain in survival time was not large enough to reach statistical significance. Patients receiving interferon-alpha 2b also had a 5- to 6-month prolongation of the plateau phase.

562,Assessment of the efficacy of noninvasive screening for patients with asymptomatic neck bruits,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several recent clinical trials have shown that endarterectomy is efficacious in patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of various test strategies for screening and diagnosing carotid artery disease. METHODS: We constructed a model of the natural history of carotid artery disease using literature-based estimates of the prevalence and incidence of carotid artery stenosis and associated morbidity and mortality. Markov cohort simulation was used to estimate the mean quality-adjusted life years and monetary costs associated with various management strategies. RESULTS: Screening is cost-effective in the baseline model. Key parameters affecting the efficacy of screening are prevalence of operable lesions, benefit of surgery, surgical complication rates, quality of life with stroke, rate of stenosis progression, and excess morbidity and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic patients with carotid bruits may benefit from screening if the prevalence rate is > or = 20%, the benefits and risks associated with surgery are similar to those observed in the Asymptomatic Carotid Atherosclerosis Study, and the quality of life with stroke is considerably lower than the quality of life without stroke.

563,Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators relative to amiodarone for prevention of sudden cardiac death,"BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are remarkably effective in terminating ventricular arrhythmias, but they are expensive and the extent to which they extend life is unknown. The marginal cost-effectiveness of ICDs relative to amiodarone has not been clearly established. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of a third-generation implantable ICD with that of empirical amiodarone treatment for preventing sudden cardiac death in patients at high or intermediate risk. DESIGN: A Markov model was used to evaluate health and economic outcomes of patients who received an ICD, amiodarone, or a sequential regimen that reserved ICD for patients who had an arrhythmia during amiodarone treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years gained, costs, and marginal cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: For the base-case analysis, it was assumed that treatment with an ICD would reduce the total mortality rate by 20% to 40% at 1 year compared with amiodarone and that the ICD generator would be replaced every 4 years. In high-risk patients, if an ICD reduces total mortality by 20%, patients who receive an ICD live for 4.18 quality-adjusted life-years and have a lifetime expenditure of $88,400. Patients receiving amiodarone live for 3.68 quality-adjusted life-years and have a lifetime expenditure of $51,000. Marginal cost-effectiveness of an ICD relative to amiodarone is $74,400 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. If an ICD reduces mortality by 40%, the cost-effectiveness of ICD use is $37,300 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Both choice of therapy (an ICD or amiodarone) and the cost-effectiveness ratio are sensitive to assumptions about quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an ICD will cost more than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained unless it reduces all-cause mortality by 30% or more relative to amiodarone.

574,Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators relative to amiodarone for prevention of sudden cardiac death,"BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are remarkably effective in terminating ventricular arrhythmias, but they are expensive and the extent to which they extend life is unknown. The marginal cost-effectiveness of ICDs relative to amiodarone has not been clearly established. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of a third-generation implantable ICD with that of empirical amiodarone treatment for preventing sudden cardiac death in patients at high or intermediate risk. DESIGN: A Markov model was used to evaluate health and economic outcomes of patients who received an ICD, amiodarone, or a sequential regimen that reserved ICD for patients who had an arrhythmia during amiodarone treatment. MEASUREMENTS: Life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years gained, costs, and marginal cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: For the base-case analysis, it was assumed that treatment with an ICD would reduce the total mortality rate by 20% to 40% at 1 year compared with amiodarone and that the ICD generator would be replaced every 4 years. In high-risk patients, if an ICD reduces total mortality by 20%, patients who receive an ICD live for 4.18 quality-adjusted life-years and have a lifetime expenditure of $88,400. Patients receiving amiodarone live for 3.68 quality-adjusted life-years and have a lifetime expenditure of $51,000. Marginal cost-effectiveness of an ICD relative to amiodarone is $74,400 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. If an ICD reduces mortality by 40%, the cost-effectiveness of ICD use is $37,300 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Both choice of therapy (an ICD or amiodarone) and the cost-effectiveness ratio are sensitive to assumptions about quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Use of an ICD will cost more than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained unless it reduces all-cause mortality by 30% or more relative to amiodarone.

575,Cost-effectiveness of HIV-prevention skills training for men who have sex with men,"OBJECTIVE: A previous study empirically compared the effects of two HIV-prevention interventions for men who have sex with men: (i) a safer sex lecture, and (ii) the same lecture coupled with a 1.5 h skills-training group session. The skills-training intervention led to a significant increase in condom use at 12-month follow-up, compared with the lecture-only condition. The current study retrospectively assesses the incremental cost-effectiveness of skills training to determine whether it is worth the extra cost to add this component to an HIV-prevention intervention that would otherwise consist of a safer sex lecture only. DESIGN: Standard techniques of incremental cost-utility analysis were employed. METHODS: A societal perspective and a 5% discount rate were used. Cost categories assessed included: staff salary, fringe benefits, quality assurance, session materials, client transportation, client time valuation, and costs shared with other programs. A Bernoulli-process model of HIV transmission was used to estimate the number of HIV infections averted by the skills-training intervention component. For each infection averted, the discounted medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved were estimated. One- and multi-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of base-case results to changes in modeling assumptions. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, the incremental cost of the skills training was less than $13,000 (or about $40 per person). The discounted medical costs averted by incrementally preventing HIV infections were over $170,000; more than 21 discounted QALY were saved. The cost per QALY saved was negative, indicating cost-savings. These results are robust to changes in most modeling assumptions. However, the model is moderately sensitive to changes in the per-contact risk of HIV transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Under most reasonable assumptions, the incremental costs of the skills training were outweighed by the medical costs saved. Thus, not only is skills training effective in reducing risky behavior, it is also cost-saving.",1997-01-01925,9147427,AIDS,S D Pinkerton,1997,11 / 3,347-57,No,9147427,"S D Pinkerton; D R Holtgrave; R O Valdiserri; Cost-effectiveness of HIV-prevention skills training for men who have sex with men, AIDS, 1997-Mar; 11(3):0269-9370; 347-57",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,80 minute skills-training session for safer-sex negotiation strategies vs. 60-90 minute lecture on safer sex and HIV transmission,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,-7984.97,United States,1992,-14729.85
576,The effect of a patient's risk-taking attitude on the cost effectiveness of testing strategies in the evaluation of pulmonary lesions,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To assess the health and cost effects of a patient's risk-taking attitudes about diagnostic tests. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Diagnostic testing strategies used in the evaluation of a patient with a radiographically detected lung lesion were evaluated. Strategies included combinations of sputum, fine-needle aspiration, bronchoscopy, thoracoscopy, and expectant management. PATIENTS: Patient data were obtained from the Survival Epidemiology and End Results Program, MEDLINE search, National Center for Health Statistics, and the Universities of Iowa and Stanford, and Kaiser Permanente Hospital. INTERVENTIONS: Different patient risk-taking attitudes were simulated using decision analysis. MEASUREMENTS: Lifetime cost of medical care, life expectancy, and cost effectiveness. RESULTS: The cost effectiveness of competing strategies depended on patient attitudes about taking risks. For a patient averse to expectantly waiting without definitive knowledge of whether cancer was or was not present, testing strategies using invasive procedures, such as thoracoscopy, were more cost effective. In contrast, for a patient who was identical except that he or she was averse to tests with higher morbidity and mortality, strategies that involved expectantly waiting, instead of more invasive tests, were more cost effective.

581,Cost-effectiveness of newer antidepressants compared with tricyclic antidepressants in managed care settings,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness of newer antidepressants compared with tricyclic antidepressants in managed care organization settings. METHOD: We employed cost-utility analysis based on a clinical decision analysis model derived from published medical literature and physician judgment. The model, which represents ideal primary care practice, compares treatment with nefazodone to treatment with either imipramine or fluoxetine or to a step approach involving initial treatment with imipramine followed by nefazodone for treatment failures. The outcome measures were lifetime medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs per QALY gained. RESULTS: The base case analysis found that nefazodone treatment had $16,669 in medical costs, compared with $15,348 for imipramine, $16,061 for the imipramine step approach, and $16,998 for fluoxetine. QALYs were greatest for nefazodone (14.64), compared with 14.32 for imipramine, 14.40 for the step approach, and 14.58 for fluoxetine. The cost-effectiveness ratio comparing nefazodone with imipramine was $4065 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness ratio comparing nefazodone with the step approach was $2555 per QALY gained. There were only minor differences in costs and outcomes between nefazodone and fluoxetine, with nefazodone resulting in $329 fewer costs and 0.06 more QALYs. The cost-effectiveness ratios comparing fluoxetine with imipramine and with the step approach were $6346 per QALY gained and $5206 per QALY gained, respectively. In the sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness ratios comparing nefazodone and imipramine ranged from $2572 to $5841 per QALY gained. The model was most sensitive to assumptions about treatment compliance rates. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that nefazodone is a cost- effective treatment compared with imipramine or fluoxetine treatment for major depression.

585,The cost-effectiveness of a cardiovascular risk reduction program in general practice,"An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial of two lifestyle interventions and a routine care (control) group to assess the cost-effectiveness of a general practice-based lifestyle change program for patients with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Routine care was the base case comparator because it represents 'current therapy' for cardiovascular disease (CVD). A 'no care' control group was not considered a clinically acceptable alternative to lifestyle interventions. The interventions consisted of an education guide and video for GPs to assess individual patient risk factors and plan a program for risk factor behavior change. Each patient received a risk factor assessment, education materials, a series of videos to watch on lifestyle behaviors and some patients received a self-help booklet. Eighty-two general practitioners were randomised from 75 general practices in Sydney's Western Metropolitan Region to (i) routine care (n = 25), (ii) video group (n = 29) or (iii) video + self help group (n = 28). GPs enrolled patients into the trial who met selection criteria for being at risk of CVD. There were 255 patients in the routine care (control) group, 270 in the video (intervention) group and 232 in the video + self help (intervention) group enrolled in the trial. Outcome measures included patient risk factor status: blood pressure, body mass index, cholesterol and smoking status at entry to trial and after 1 year.

593,Cost-effectiveness of transesophageal echocardiographic-guided cardioversion: a decision analytic model for patients admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation,"OBJECTIVES: Using a decision-analytic model, we sought to examine the cost-effectiveness of three strategies for cardioversion of patients admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation. BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE)-guided cardioversion has been proposed as a method for early cardioversion of patients with atrial fibrillation. The cost-effectiveness of this approach, relative to conventional therapy, has not been studied. METHODS: We ascertained the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of three strategies: 1) conventional therapy--transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and warfarin therapy for 1 month before cardioversion; 2) initial TTE, followed by TEE and early cardioversion if no thrombus is detected; 3) initial TEE, with early cardioversion if no thrombus is detected. With strategies 2 and 3, if a thrombus is seen, follow-up TEE is performed. If no thrombus is seen, cardioversion is then performed. All strategies utilized anticoagulation before and extending for 1 month after cardioversion. Life expectancy, utilities (quality-of-life weights) and event probabilities were ascertained from published reports. Cost estimates were based on published data and hospital accounting information. RESULTS: Transesophageal echocardiographic-guided early cardioversion (strategy 3: cost $2,774, QALY 8.49) dominates TTE/TEE-guided cardioversion (strategy 2: cost $3,106, QALY 8.48) and conventional therapy (strategy 1: cost $3,070, QALY 8.48) because it is the least costly with similar effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that TEE-guided cardioversion (strategy 3) dominates conventional therapy if the risk of stroke after TEE negative for atrial thrombus is slightly less than that after conventional therapy (baseline estimate 0.8%). The results also depend on the risk of major hemorrhage but are less sensitive to baseline estimates of morbidity from TEE, cost of TTE, cost of hospital admission for cardioversion and utilities for health states. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of a decision-analytic model, TEE-guided early cardioversion, without TTE, is a reasonable cost-saving alternative to conventional therapy for patients admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation. Such a strategy appears particularly beneficial for patients with an increased risk of hemorrhagic complications. Future clinical studies examining the TEE strategy should consider eliminating initial TTE and carefully assess both the thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk.",1997-01-01929,8996304,J Am Coll Cardiol,T B Seto,1997,29 / 1,122-30,No,8996304,"T B Seto; D A Taira; J Tsevat; W J Manning; Cost-effectiveness of transesophageal echocardiographic-guided cardioversion: a decision analytic model for patients admitted to the hospital with atrial fibrillation, J Am Coll Cardiol, 1997-Jan; 29(1):0735-1097; 122-30",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Treansesophageal echocardiography guided cardioversion vs. Conventional therapy, treansesophageal echocardiography plus warfarin for one month before cardioversion",Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,1993,Not Stated
594,Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Prophylaxis against the first variceal bleeding has been proposed to reduce morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients. No previous information is available regarding the cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis. The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of variceal bleeding prophylaxis with propranolol, sclerotherapy, and shunt surgery in cirrhotic patients stratified by bleeding risk. METHODS: A hypothetical cohort was stratified according to bleeding risk. The natural history of cirrhosis with esophageal varices was simulated using a Markov model. Transitional probabilities extracted from published studies and costs were obtained from our institution's billing department. Sensitivity analyses were performed for important variables. RESULTS: Propranolol results in cost savings ranging between $450 and $14,600 over a 5-year period. The extent of cost savings depended on the individual patient's bleeding risk. In addition, propranolol increased the quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.1-0.4 years. Sclerotherapy was significantly less cost-effective than propranolol and had no advantage on quality of life.

In addition, propranolol increased the quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.1-0.4 years. Sclerotherapy was significantly less cost-effective than propranolol and had no advantage on quality of life. Shunt surgery was effective therapy for prevention of bleeding but decreased life expectancy and quality of life in some risk groups and was not cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Propranolol is the only cost-effective form of prophylactic therapy for preventing initial variceal bleeding in cirrhosis regardless of bleeding risk.",1997-01-01930,9024301,Gastroenterology,J C Teran,1997,112 / 2,473-82,No,9024301,"J C Teran; T F Imperiale; K D Mullen; A S Tavill; A J McCullough; Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding in cirrhosis: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Gastroenterology, 1997-Feb; 112(2):0016-5085; 473-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Shunt surgery vs. Propranolol,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,1995,Not Stated
598,Cost effectiveness scenario analysis for a proposed trial of hormone replacement therapy,"Whereas evaluation of resource implications and quality of life are often incorporated into assessments of health technology, the decision to undertake the assessment is still mostly driven by interests in the clinical outcomes alone. A systematic approach to evaluating expected returns to health technology assessment has not been readily taken up by research funders or assessors. This paper sets out a specific methodology for ex ante evaluation or triage and proposes a decision procedure, using alternative outcome scenarios and the associated policy changes and costs and benefits, against a background of likely clinical practice in the absence of the assessment. The methodology is used to consider implications of a proposed major clinical trial to assess the long term costs and benefits of hormone replacement therapy.",1997-01-01931,10165460,Health Policy,J Townsend,1997,39 / 3,181-94,No,10165460,"J Townsend; M Buxton; Cost effectiveness scenario analysis for a proposed trial of hormone replacement therapy, Health Policy, 1997-Mar; 39(3):0168-8510; 181-94",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Clinical trial of long term effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) vs. current use of HRT,Not Stated,64 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated,6.00,6.00,1150,United Kingdom,1992,3747.04
599,Drug treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease. A lifetime cost-utility analysis,"A recent literature overview has estimated the long term frequency of the main outcomes of Crohn's disease (e.g. relapses, hospitalisations and surgery). Using these frequency data, we defined a model for the long term course of the disease. In this model, the quality-of-life (QOL) scores for the main levels of disease severity were determined by a panel of expert gastroenterologists. We conducted a combined analysis of these long term clinical data and of this QOL information to determine the cost-utility ratio of long term maintenance therapy with mesalazine (mesalamine) in patients with inactive Crohn's disease. After obtaining the cost-of-illness data needed for this analysis from a recent study conducted in the UK, we completed our incremental cost-utility analysis, in which mesalazine was compared with no maintenance treatment, using 2 hypothetical groups of 100 patients. These 2 groups were assumed to have the same general characteristics as those found in a group of 583 patients included in a recent meta-analysis. Our cost-utility evaluation included 5% annual discounting. In the mesalazine group, the overall lifetime costs for the 100 patients were around $US5 100,000 with an overall utility value of about 1700 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Both the lifetime costs and the utility values for the placebo (no treatment) group were very similar to those calculated for the mesalazine group. Our cost-utility analysis showed that mesalazine maintenance therapy was associated with a cost of about $US5000 per QALY gained. There was, therefore, a small incremental benefit obtained, albeit with a very small incremental cost. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. In conclusion, our study showed that long term maintenance therapy with mesalazine in patients with inactive Crohn's disease should not be discouraged on the basis of preliminary cost-utility considerations. However, long term placebo-controlled studies of mesalazine are urgently needed to better define the long term prognosis of these patients.",1997-01-01932,10168032,Pharmacoeconomics,G Trallori,1997,11 / 5,444-53,Yes,10168032,"G Trallori; A Messori; Drug treatments for maintaining remission in Crohn's disease.

600,Cost-effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis after occupational exposure to HIV,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the economic efficiency of recent US Public Health Service recommendations for chemoprophylaxis with a combination of antiretroviral drugs following high-risk occupational exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). To provide a framework for evaluating the relative effectiveness and costs associated with candidate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimens. METHODS: Standard techniques of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis were used. The analysis compares the costs and consequences of a hypothetical, voluntary combination-drug PEP program consisting of counseling for all HIV-exposed health care workers, followed by chemoprophylaxis for those who elect it vs an alternative in which PEP is not offered. A societal perspective was adopted and a 5% discount rate was used. Hospital costs of recommended treatment regimens (zidovudine alone or in combination with lamivudine and indinavir) were used, following the dosing schedules recommended by the US Public Health Service. Estimates of lifetime treatment costs for HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were obtained from the literature. Because the effectiveness of combination PEP has not been established, the effectiveness of zidovudine PEP was used in the base-case analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Net PEP program costs, number of HIV infections averted, cost per HIV infection averted, and cost-utility ratio (net cost per discounted quality-adjusted life-year saved) for zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir combination PEP. Lower bounds on the effectiveness required for combination regimens to be considered incrementally cost saving, relative to zidovudine PEP alone, were calculated. Multiple sensitivity and threshold analyses were performed to assess the impact of uncertainty in key parameters. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, the net cost of a combination PEP program for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 HIV-exposed health care workers is about $4.8 million. Nearly 18 HIV infections are prevented. The net cost per averted infection is just less than $400,000, which exceeds estimated lifetime HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome treatment costs. Although combination PEP is not cost saving, the cost-utility ratio (about $37,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in the base case) is within the range conventionally considered cost-effective, provided that chemoprophylaxis is delivered in accordance with Public Health Service guidelines. Small incremental improvements in the effectiveness of PEP are associated with large overall societal savings. CONCLUSIONS: Under most reasonable assumptions, chemoprophylaxis with zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir following moderate- to high-risk occupational exposures is cost-effective for society. If combination PEP is minimally more effective than zidovudine PEP, then the added expense of including lamivudine and indinavir in the drug regimen is clearly justified.",1997-01-01933,9308509,Arch Intern Med,S D Pinkerton,1997,157 / 17,1972-80,No,9308509,"S D Pinkerton; D R Holtgrave; H J Pinkerton; Cost-effectiveness of chemoprophylaxis after occupational exposure to HIV, Arch Intern Med, 1997-Sep-22; 157(17):0003-9926; 1972-80",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Zidovudine, lamivudine, & indinavir combination post-exposure prophylaxis for very high infection risk (1.0%) exposures vs. no program",Not Stated,34 Years,34 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,2383,United States,1996,3930.83
