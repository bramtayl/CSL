28101,Distributional impact of rotavirus vaccination in 25 GAVI countries: estimating disparities in benefits and cost-effectiveness,"Other studies have demonstrated that the impact and cost effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination differs among countries, with greater mortality reduction benefits and lower cost-effectiveness ratios in low-income and high-mortality countries. This analysis combines the results of a country level model of rotavirus vaccination published elsewhere with data from Demographic and Health Surveys on within-country patterns of vaccine coverage and diarrhea mortality risk factors to estimate within-country distributional effects of rotavirus vaccination. The study examined 25 countries eligible for funding through the GAVI Alliance.For each country we estimate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of vaccination for each wealth quintile assuming current vaccination patterns and for a scenario where vaccine coverage is equalized to the highest quintile's coverage. In the case of India, variations in coverage and risk proxies by state were modeled to estimate geographic distributional effects.In all countries, rates of vaccination were highest and risks of mortality were lowest in the top two wealth quintiles. However countries differ greatly in the relative inequities in these two underlying variables. Similarly, in all countries examined, the cost-effectiveness ratio for vaccination ($/Disability-Adjusted Life Year averted, DALY) is substantially greater in the higher quintiles (ranging from 2-10 times higher). In all countries, the greatest potential benefit of vaccination was in the poorest quintiles. However, due to reduced vaccination coverage, projected benefits for these quintiles were often lower. Equitable coverage was estimated to result in an 89% increase in mortality reduction for the poorest quintile and a 38% increase overall.Rotavirus vaccination is most cost-effective in low-income groups and regions. However in many countries, simply adding new vaccines to existing systems targets investments to higher income children, due to disparities in vaccination coverage. Maximizing health benefits for the poorest children and value for money require increased attention to these distributional effects.",2012-99-08996,22520124,Vaccine,Richard Rheingans,2011,29 /,A15-23,Yes,22520124,"Richard Rheingans; Deborah Atherly; John Anderson; Distributional impact of rotavirus vaccination in 25 GAVI countries: estimating disparities in benefits and cost-effectiveness, Vaccine, ; 29 ():1873-2518; A15-23",DALY,Ethiopia,Not Stated,Immunization,Rotavirus vaccination vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,43.38,United States,2010,51.49

28107,Costs and cost-effectiveness of training traditional birth attendants to reduce neonatal mortality in the Lufwanyama Neonatal Survival study (LUNESP),"The Lufwanyama Neonatal Survival Project (""LUNESP"") was a cluster randomized, controlled trial that showed that training traditional birth attendants (TBAs) to perform interventions targeting birth asphyxia, hypothermia, and neonatal sepsis reduced all-cause neonatal mortality by 45%. This companion analysis was undertaken to analyze intervention costs and cost-effectiveness, and factors that might improve cost-effectiveness.We calculated LUNESP's financial and economic costs and the economic cost of implementation for a forecasted ten-year program (2011-2020). In each case, we calculated the incremental cost per death avoided and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted in real 2011 US dollars. The forecasted 10-year program analysis included a base case as well as 'conservative' and 'optimistic' scenarios. Uncertainty was characterized using one-way sensitivity analyses and a multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The estimated financial and economic costs of LUNESP were $118,574 and $127,756, respectively, or $49,469 and $53,550 per year. Fixed costs accounted for nearly 90% of total costs. For the 10-year program, discounted total and annual program costs were $256,455 and $26,834 respectively; for the base case, optimistic, and conservative scenarios, the estimated cost per death avoided was $1,866, $591, and $3,024, and cost per DALY averted was $74, $24, and $120, respectively. Outcomes were robust to variations in local costs, but sensitive to variations in intervention effect size, number of births attended by TBAs, and the extent of foreign consultants' participation.Based on established guidelines, the strategy of using trained TBAs to reduce neonatal mortality was 'highly cost effective'. We strongly recommend consideration of this approach for other remote rural populations with limited access to health care.",2012-99-09035,22545117,PLoS One,Lora L Sabin,2012,2 / 1,e35560,No,22545117,"Lora L Sabin; Anna B Knapp; William B MacLeod; Grace Phiri-Mazala; Joshua Kasimba; Davidson H Hamer; Christopher J Gill; Costs and cost-effectiveness of training traditional birth attendants to reduce neonatal mortality in the Lufwanyama Neonatal Survival study (LUNESP), PLoS One , ; 2(1):1932-6203; e35560",DALY,Zambia,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care",Training for traditional birth attendants (TBAs) on resuscitation and treatment of sepsis vs. Standard/Usual Care- no special training and supplies,Newborns,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,176,United States,2011,202.5
28108,Cost-effectiveness analysis of neonatal hearing screening program in china: should universal screening be prioritized?,"ABSTRACT:Neonatal hearing screening (NHS) has been routinely offered as a vital component of early childhood care in developed countries, whereas such a screening program is still at the pilot or preliminary stage as regards its nationwide implementation in developing countries. To provide significant evidence for health policy making in China, this study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of NHS program implementation in case of eight provinces of China.A cost-effectiveness model was conducted and all neonates annually born from 2007 to 2009 in eight provinces of China were simulated in this model. The model parameters were estimated from the established databases in the general hospitals or maternal and child health hospitals of these eight provinces, supplemented from the published literature. The model estimated changes in program implementation costs, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for universal screening compared to targeted screening in eight provinces.A multivariate sensitivity analysis was performed to determine uncertainty in health effect estimates and cost-effectiveness ratios using a probabilistic modeling technique. Targeted strategy trended to be cost-effective in Guangxi, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, and Beijing from the level of 9%, 9%, 8%, 4%, 3%, 7%, 5%, and 2%, respectively; while universal strategy trended to be cost-effective in those provinces from the level of 70%, 70%, 48%, 10%, 8%, 28%, 15%, 4%, respectively. This study showed although there was a huge disparity in the implementation of the NHS program in the surveyed provinces, both universal strategy and targeted strategy showed cost-effectiveness in those relatively developed provinces, while neither of the screening strategy showed cost-effectiveness in those relatively developing provinces.

28123,Cost-effectiveness analysis of neonatal hearing screening program in china: should universal screening be prioritized?,"ABSTRACT:Neonatal hearing screening (NHS) has been routinely offered as a vital component of early childhood care in developed countries, whereas such a screening program is still at the pilot or preliminary stage as regards its nationwide implementation in developing countries. To provide significant evidence for health policy making in China, this study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of NHS program implementation in case of eight provinces of China.A cost-effectiveness model was conducted and all neonates annually born from 2007 to 2009 in eight provinces of China were simulated in this model. The model parameters were estimated from the established databases in the general hospitals or maternal and child health hospitals of these eight provinces, supplemented from the published literature. The model estimated changes in program implementation costs, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for universal screening compared to targeted screening in eight provinces.A multivariate sensitivity analysis was performed to determine uncertainty in health effect estimates and cost-effectiveness ratios using a probabilistic modeling technique. Targeted strategy trended to be cost-effective in Guangxi, Jiangxi, Henan, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hebei, Shandong, and Beijing from the level of 9%, 9%, 8%, 4%, 3%, 7%, 5%, and 2%, respectively; while universal strategy trended to be cost-effective in those provinces from the level of 70%, 70%, 48%, 10%, 8%, 28%, 15%, 4%, respectively. This study showed although there was a huge disparity in the implementation of the NHS program in the surveyed provinces, both universal strategy and targeted strategy showed cost-effectiveness in those relatively developed provinces, while neither of the screening strategy showed cost-effectiveness in those relatively developing provinces. This study also showed that both strategies especially universal strategy achieve a good economic effect in the long term costs.Universal screening might be considered as the prioritized implementation goal especially in those relatively developed provinces of China as it provides the best health and economic effects, while targeted screening might be temporarily more realistic than universal screening in those relatively developing provinces of China.",2012-99-08988,22510223,BMC Health Serv Res,Li-Hui Huang,2012,3 / 1,97,Yes,22510223,"Li-Hui Huang; Luo Zhang; Ruo-Yan Gai Tobe; Fang-Hua Qi; Long Sun; Yue Teng; Qing-Lin Ke; Fei Mai; Xue-Feng Zhang; Mei Zhang; Ru-Lan Yang; Lin Tu; Hong-Hui Li; Yan-Qing Gu; Sai-Nan Xu; Xiao-Yan Yue; Xiao-Dong Li; Bei-Er Qi; Xiao-Huan Cheng; Wei Tang; Ling-Zhong Xu; De-Min Han; Cost-effectiveness analysis of neonatal hearing screening program in china: should universal screening be prioritized?, BMC Health Serv Res, 2003-Aug-01; 3(1):1472-6963; 97",DALY,China,Not Stated,Screening,Targeted screening for detection of permanent congenital and early-onset hearing impairment (PCEHI) vs. None,"risk factors for hearing impairment, Beijing Province",5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,7652,United States,2009,9231.14
28124,Cost-effectiveness of extending the coverage of water supply fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries in Australia,"OBJECTIVE: Fluoride was first added to the Australian water supply in 1953, and by 2003, 69% of Australia's population was receiving the minimum recommended dose. Extending coverage of fluoridation to all remaining communities of at least 1000 people is a key strategy of Australia's National Oral Health Plan 2004-2013. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this strategy from an Australian health sector perspective. METHODS: Health gains from the prevention of caries in the Australian population are modelled over the average 15-year lifespan of a treatment plant. Taking capital and on-going operational costs of fluoridation into account, as well as costs of caries treatment, we determine the dollars per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted from extending coverage of fluoridation to all large (=1000 people) and small (<1000 people) communities in Australia. RESULTS: Extending coverage of fluoridation to all communities of at least 1000 people will lead to improved population health (3700 DALYs, 95% uncertainty interval: 2200-5700 DALYs), with a dominant cost-effectiveness ratio and 100% probability of cost-savings. Extending coverage to smaller communities leads to 60% more health gains, but is not cost-effective, with a median cost-effectiveness ratio of A$92?000/DALY and only 10% probability of being under a cost-effectiveness threshold of A$50?000/DALY. CONCLUSIONS: Extension of fluoridation coverage under the National Oral Health Plan is highly recommended, but given the substantial dental health disparities and inequalities in access to dental care that currently exist for more regional and remote communities, there may be good justification for extending coverage to include all Australians, regardless of where they live, despite less favourable cost-effectiveness.",2012-99-08911,22452320,Community Dent Oral Epidemiol,Linda J Cobiac,2012,40 / 4,,No,22452320,"Linda J Cobiac; Theo Vos; Cost-effectiveness of extending the coverage of water supply fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries in Australia, Community Dent Oral Epidemiol, ; 40(4):0301-5661",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,Environmental,Flouridation of water supply for prevention of dental caries vs. None,100% coverage,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,92000,Australia,2003,84420.38

Unit costs were taken from the WHO-CHOICE price database.Cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted, expressed in international dollars ($Int) for the year 2005.In both regions certain interventions in cervical cancer control (screening through cervical smear tests or visual inspection with acetic acid in combination with treatment) and colorectal cancer control (increasing the coverage of treatment interventions) cost <$Int2000 per DALY averted and can be considered highly cost effective. In the sub-Saharan African region screening for colorectal cancer (by colonoscopy at age 50 in combination with treatment) costs $Int2000-6000 per DALY averted and can be considered cost effective. In both regions certain interventions in breast cancer control (treatment of all cancer stages in combination with mammography screening) cost $Int2000-6000 per DALY averted and can also be considered cost effective. Other interventions, such as campaigns to eat more fruit and vegetable or subsidies in colorectal cancer control, are not cost effective according to the criteria defined.Highly cost effective interventions to combat cervical and colorectal cancer are available in the African and Asian sub-regions. In cervical cancer control, these include screening through smear tests or visual inspection in combination with treatment. In colorectal cancer, increasing treatment coverage is highly cost effective (screening through colonoscopy is cost effective in the African sub-region). In breast cancer control, mammography screening in combination with treatment of all stages is cost effective.",2012-99-08805,22389347,BMJ,Gary M Ginsberg,2012,344 /,e614,No,22389347,"Gary M Ginsberg; Jeremy A Lauer; Sten Zelle; Steef Baeten; Rob Baltussen; Cost effectiveness of strategies to combat breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer in sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia: mathematical modelling study, BMJ, ; 344 ():0959-8138; e614",DALY,"Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, North Korea, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Timor-Leste",Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Immunization, Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical, Screening, Surgical",Colonoscopy screening every 10 years + cancer treatment vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,1124,United States,2005,1489.52

DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis of or combined strategies for controlling vision and hearing loss by means of a lifetime population model. SETTING: Two World Health Organization sub-regions of the world where vision and hearing loss are major burdens: sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia.

Intervention effects and resource inputs based on published reports, expert opinion, and the WHO-CHOICE database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted, expressed in international dollars ($Int) for the year 2005. RESULTS : Treatment of chronic otitis media, extracapsular cataract surgery, trichiasis surgery, treatment for meningitis, and annual screening of schoolchildren for refractive error are among the most cost effective interventions to control hearing and vision impairment, with the cost per DALY averted <$Int285 in both regions. Screening of both schoolchildren (annually) and adults (every five years) for hearing loss costs around $Int1000 per DALY averted. These interventions can be considered highly cost effective. Mass treatment with azithromycin to control trachoma can be considered cost effective in the African but not the South East Asian sub-region.

DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis of or combined strategies for controlling vision and hearing loss by means of a lifetime population model. SETTING: Two World Health Organization sub-regions of the world where vision and hearing loss are major burdens: sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia. DATA SOURCES: Biological and behavioural parameters from clinical and observational studies and population based surveys. Intervention effects and resource inputs based on published reports, expert opinion, and the WHO-CHOICE database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted, expressed in international dollars ($Int) for the year 2005. RESULTS : Treatment of chronic otitis media, extracapsular cataract surgery, trichiasis surgery, treatment for meningitis, and annual screening of schoolchildren for refractive error are among the most cost effective interventions to control hearing and vision impairment, with the cost per DALY averted <$Int285 in both regions. Screening of both schoolchildren (annually) and adults (every five years) for hearing loss costs around $Int1000 per DALY averted. These interventions can be considered highly cost effective.
