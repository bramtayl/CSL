13701,Cost-effectiveness of different strategies for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in a health resource-limited setting,"PURPOSE: To compare the lifetime cost and effectiveness of five alternative chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) management strategies: rivaroxaban, warfarin, aspirin plus clopidogrel, aspirin and no prevention. METHODS: An individual-level state-transition model was developed to track the lifetime disease course associated with AF. The clinical and utility data were derived from published studies. The cost data were estimated based on local charges and current Chinese practices. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of uncertainty on the results. RESULTS: For base-case patients with a CHADS2 score of 3, the cost per additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained for rivaroxaban compared with no prevention, aspirin, aspirin plus clopidogrel and warfarin was $116,884, $153,944, $155,979 and $216,273, respectively. CHADS2 score had a substantial impact on the model outcomes for different prevention strategies. The time distribution of warfarin international normalised ratio (INR), stroke and intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) risks, cost of rivaroxaban and utility of warfarin therapy had substantial impacts on the results. Based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $16,350/QALY, no prevention strategy was the preferred therapy for a patient with a low risk for stroke and a high risk for ICH; aspirin was preferred for patients with a moderate risk for stroke and ICH; and warfarin was preferred for patients with a high risk for stroke and a low risk of ICH. CONCLUSION: In the context of limited health resources, rivaroxaban is unlikely to be cost-effective, although it provided more health benefits comparing with other strategies. Additionally, warfarin with good INR control might be more suitable for AF patients in developing regions.",2014-01-17102,24048510,Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,Bin Wu,2014,28 / 1,87-98,No,24048510,"Bin Wu; Li Kun; Xiaoyan Liu; Ben He; Cost-effectiveness of different strategies for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in a health resource-limited setting, Cardiovasc Drugs Ther, ; 28(1):0920-3206; 87-98",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rivaroxaban vs. Aspirin 75mg/day plus clopidogrel 75 mg/day,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,155979,United States,2012,175828.12

13703,Cost-utility analysis of a collaborative care intervention for major depressive disorder in an occupational healthcare setting,"PURPOSE: Major depression is associated with high levels of absence and reduced productivity. Therefore the costs to society are high. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of collaborative care for major depressive disorder (MDD) compared to care as usual in an occupational healthcare setting. A societal perspective was taken. METHODS: In this randomised controlled trial, 126 sick-listed workers with MDD were included (65 collaborative care, 61 care as usual). Baseline measurements and follow up measures (3, 6, 9 and 12 months) were assessed by questionnaire. We applied the Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for costs associated with psychiatric illness, the SF-HQL and the EQ-5D respectively measuring the health care utilization, production losses and general health related quality of life. RESULTS: The average annual healthcare costs in the collaborative care group were euro3,874 (95 % CI euro2,778-euro 5,718) compared to euro4,583 (95 % CI euro3,108-euro6,794) in the care as usual group. The average quality of life years (QALY''s) gained were lower in the collaborative care group, 0.05 QALY. The majority of the ICERS (69 %) indicate that collaborative care is less costly but also less effective than care as usual. Including the productivity costs did not change this result. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-utility analysis showed that collaborative care generated reduced costs and a reduction in effects compared to care as usual and was therefore not a cost-effective intervention.",2014-01-17107,24085535,J Occup Rehabil,Maartje Goorden,2014,24 / 3,555-62,No,24085535,"Maartje Goorden; Moniek C Vlasveld; Johannes R Anema; Willem van Mechelen; Aartjan T F Beekman; Rob Hoedeman; Christina M van der Feltz-Cornelis; Leona Hakkaart-van Roijen; Cost-utility analysis of a collaborative care intervention for major depressive disorder in an occupational healthcare setting, J Occup Rehabil, ; 24(3):1053-0487; 555-62",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Collaborative care intervention vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,14589,Euro,2009,24526.06
13704,Cost effectiveness of training rural providers to perform joint injections,"OBJECTIVE: Community-based outpatient clinics (CBOCs) have been established by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide primary care services to veterans living in remote and rural regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of training rural primary care providers to perform knee injections in CBOCs, thereby avoiding referring the patient to an urban medical center for an injection by rheumatology or orthopedic specialists. METHODS: We developed a decision-analysis model to compare costs and outcomes between rural providers who are trained to perform knee injections versus those who are not trained, therefore requiring a referral to a specialist to provide the injections. The model was run separately using costs from the perspective of the VA as well from the patient''s perspective. The effectiveness outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed using 10,000 second-order Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: In our base-case analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for trained rural providers was $21,190/QALY using costs from the perspective of the VA and $205/QALY using costs from the patient''s perspective. Training rural providers was cost effective in 74.4% and 93.6% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY from the perspectives of the VA and the patient, respectively. CONCLUSION: Training rural providers to perform knee injections for patients with knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis appears cost effective using the commonly used threshold of $50,000/QALY if more than 20 such patients per year are seen at rural primary care clinics. These results provide support for our ongoing efforts to implement such a training program.",2014-01-17110,24106223,Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),Richard E Nelson,2014,66 / 4,559-66,No,24106223,"Richard E Nelson; Michael J Battistone; William D Ashworth; Andrea M Barker; Marissa Grotzke; Timothy A Huhtala; Joanne Lafleur; Robert Z Tashjian; Grant W Cannon; Cost effectiveness of training rural providers to perform joint injections, Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken), ; 66(4):2151-4658; 559-66",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Training rural primary care physicians who practice at VA community-based clinics to perform knee injections vs. Standard/Usual Care- A referral to a specialist to provide the injections,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,21190,United States,2011,24380.85
13705,Cost-effectiveness comparison between topical silver sulfadiazine and enclosed silver dressing for partial-thickness burn treatment,"The standard treatment of partial-thickness burns includes topical silver products such as silver sulfadiazine (SSD) cream and enclosed dressings including silver-impregnated foam (Mepilex Ag; Molnlycke Health Care, Gothenburg, Sweden) and silver-laden sheets (Aquacel Ag; ConvaTec, Skillman, NJ). The current state of health care is limited by resources, with an emphasis on evidence-based outcomes and cost-effective treatments. This study includes a decision analysis with an incremental cost-utility ratio comparing enclosed silver dressings with SSD in partial-thickness burn patients with TBSA less than 20%. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify clinically relevant health states in partial-thickness burn patients. These health states include successful healing, infection, and noninfected delayed healing requiring either surgery or conservative management. The probabilities of these health states were combined with Medicare CPT reimbursement codes (cost) and patient-derived utilities to fit into the decision model. Utilities were obtained using a visual analog scale during patient interviews. Expected cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the roll-back method. The incremental cost-utility ratio for enclosed silver dressing relative to SSD was $40,167.99/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis of complication rates confirmed robustness of the model. Assuming a maximum willingness to pay $50,000/QALY, the complication rate for SSD must be 22% or higher for enclosed silver dressing to be cost effective. By varying complication rates for SSD and enclosed silver dressings, the two-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated the cost effectiveness of using enclosed silver dressing at the majority of complication rates for both treatment modalities. Enclosed silver dressings are a cost-effective means of treating partial thickness burns.",2014-01-17111,24121806,J Burn Care Res,Clifford C Sheckter,2014,35 / 4,284-90,No,24121806,"Clifford C Sheckter; Michael M Van Vliet; Naveen M Krishnan; Warren L Garner; Cost-effectiveness comparison between topical silver sulfadiazine and enclosed silver dressing for partial-thickness burn treatment, J Burn Care Res, ; 35(4):1559-047X; 284-90",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Enclosed dressings including silver-impregnated foam and silver-laden sheets vs. Silver sulfadiazine cream,Not Stated,32 Years,32 Years,Not Stated,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,40167.99,United States,2011,46216.61
13706,"Cost-effectiveness of a package of interventions for expedited antiretroviral therapy initiation during pregnancy in Cape Town, South Africa","Initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) early in pregnancy is an important component of effective interventions to prevent the mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT). The rapid initiation of ART in pregnancy(RAP) program was a package of interventions to expedite ART initiation in pregnant women in Cape Town, South Africa. Retrospective cost-effectiveness, sensitivity and threshold analyses were conducted of the RAP program to determine the cost-utility thresholds for rapid initiation of ART in pregnancy. Costs were drawn from a detailed micro-costing of the program. The overall programmatic cost was US$880 per woman and the base case cost-effectiveness ratio was US$1,160 per quality-adjusted lifeyear (QALY) saved. In threshold analyses, the RAP program remained cost-effective if mother-to-child transmission was reduced by C0.33 %; if C1.76 QALY were saved with each averted perinatal infection; or if RAP-related costs were under US$4,020 per woman. The package of rapid initiation services was very cost-effective, as compared to standard services in this setting. Threshold analyses demonstrated that the intervention required minimal reductions in perinatal infections in order to be cost-effective.

13707,The cost-effectiveness of supported employment for adults with autism in the United Kingdom,"Adults with autism face high rates of unemployment. Supported employment enables individuals with autism to secure and maintain a paid job in a regular work environment. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of supported employment compared with standard care (day services) for adults with autism in the United Kingdom. Thus, a decision-analytic economic model was developed, which used outcome data from the only trial that has evaluated supported employment for adults with autism in the United Kingdom. The main analysis considered intervention costs, while cost-savings associated with changes in accommodation status and National Health Service and personal social service resource use were examined in secondary analyses. Two outcome measures were used: the number of weeks in employment and the quality-adjusted life year. Supported employment resulted in better outcomes compared with standard care, at an extra cost of pound18 per additional week in employment or pound5600 per quality-adjusted life year. In secondary analyses that incorporated potential cost-savings, supported employment dominated standard care (i.e. it produced better outcomes at a lower total cost). The analysis suggests that supported employment schemes for adults with autism in the United Kingdom are cost-effective compared with standard care. Further research needs to confirm these findings.",2014-01-17114,24126866,Autism,Ifigeneia Mavranezouli,2014,18 / 8,975-84,No,24126866,"Ifigeneia Mavranezouli; Odette Megnin-Viggars; Nadir Cheema; Patricia Howlin; Simon Baron-Cohen; Stephen Pilling; The cost-effectiveness of supported employment for adults with autism in the United Kingdom, Autism, ; 18(8):1461-7005; 975-84",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Supported Employment vs. Standard/Usual Care- Day services,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,113 Months,3.50,3.50,5600,United Kingdom,2012,10007.56
13708,Percutaneous cardiac assist devices compared with surgical hemodynamic support alternatives: cost-effectiveness in the emergent setting,"This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous cardiac assist device (pVAD) therapy in the emergent setting compared with traditional surgical hemodynamic support alternatives. BACKGROUND: Previous research has demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of pVAD hemodynamic support for patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention. For patients in cardiogenic shock (CS), use of pVAD therapy has been shown to reduce length of stay (LOS). METHODS: National utilization and outcome data from the 2010-2011 MedPAR and state-sponsored all-payer databases were collected for patients with an acute myocardial infarction complicated by CS who were treated with either a pVAD (n = 883) or with traditional surgical hemodynamic support alternatives (ECMO and extracorporeal VAD) (n = 305). RESULTS: Discharge survival was greater with pVADs than with surgical alternatives (56% vs. 42%, P < 0.001) and was achieved with a strong trend toward reduced LOS (13.2 and 17.9 days, respectively, P = 0.055) and a significantly lower cost of the index admission ($90,929 and $144,257, respectively, P < 0.001). Cost-effectiveness analysis based on the national data demonstrated that pVAD achieved improved outcomes at lower cost. Data were also collected for similar patients who underwent protocol-guided pVAD therapy (using Impella 2.5) at PinnacleHealth, between 2009 and 2011 (n = 30). At this site, the survival rate increased to 60%, length of hospitalization was shortened to 6 days, and admission costs were lowered to $53,850 relative to the surgical alternatives strategy. CONCLUSIONS: For patients in CS requiring emergent hemodynamic support, pVAD therapy offers a less invasive alternative that can be deployed sooner, resulting in better outcomes, shorter LOS, lower costs and with no incremental cost, and a survival benefit when compared with traditional surgical hemodynamic support alternatives.

The aim of our investigation was to examine cost-utility for current German drug market costs and compared to other countries. Outcome data were taken from dabigatran''s RE-LY, rivaroxaban''s ROCKET AF, and apixaban''s ARISTOTLE trials. A Markov decision model, the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS), and further sensitivity analyses were used to simulate comparisons between NOACs over a follow up period of 20 years. The main perspective used for the analyses is from a German public health care insurance perspective.

13713,Cost effectiveness of adding dapagliflozin to insulin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on insulin therapy have inadequate glycaemic control. In such cases, Dutch guidelines recommend unlimited up-titration of insulin, yet in practice many patients never reach their glycaemic target. Clinical evidence shows that dapagliflozin-a highly selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor-meets a need for these patients, i.e. by reducing glycated haemoglobin levels and bodyweight. We estimated the cost effectiveness and cost utility of adding dapagliflozin to insulin compared with not adding dapagliflozin in patients with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control while on insulin. METHODS: The cost effectiveness of dapagliflozin was estimated using the Cardiff Diabetes Model, using direct comparative efficacy data from a randomized placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00673231). In this trial, up-titration of insulin was allowed in case of severe glycaemic imbalance. Risk factor progression and the occurrence of future vascular events were estimated using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study 68 risk equations. Costs and utilities were derived from the literature. The analysis was conducted from the societal perspective, simulating the remaining lifetime of the patients. RESULTS: The overall incidence of macro- and microvascular complications was lower, and life expectancy was greater (19.43 versus 19.35 life-years [LYs]) in patients receiving dapagliflozin than in those not receiving dapagliflozin. Patients in the dapagliflozin arm obtained an incremental benefit of 0.42 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The lifetime incremental cost per patient in the dapagliflozin arm was euro2,293, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro27,779 per LY gained and an incremental cost-utility ratio of euro5,502 per QALY gained. Sensitivity and scenario analyses showed that the results were insensitive to variations in modelling assumptions and input variables. CONCLUSION: Dapagliflozin in combination with insulin was estimated to be a cost-effective treatment option for patients with T2DM whose insulin treatment regimen does not provide adequate glycaemic control in a Dutch healthcare setting.",2014-01-17127,24243529,Clin Drug Investig,Heleen G M van Haalen,2014,34 / 2,135-46,Yes,24243529,"Heleen G M van Haalen; Marjolein Pompen; Klas Bergenheim; Phil McEwan; Rebecca Townsend; Marina Roudaut; Cost effectiveness of adding dapagliflozin to insulin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Netherlands, Clin Drug Investig, ; 34(2):1173-2563; 135-46",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Dapagliflozin, a highly selective sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, and insulin vs. Placebo",On insulin therapy,66 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,4.00,1.50,5502,Euro,2011,8809.4
13714,Cost-utility analysis of a multidisciplinary strategy to manage osteoarthritis of the knee: economic evaluation of a cluster randomized controlled trial study,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if a pharmacist-initiated multidisciplinary strategy provides value for money compared to usual care in participants with previously undiagnosed knee osteoarthritis. METHODS: Pharmacies were randomly allocated to provide either 1) usual care and a pamphlet or 2) intervention care, which consisted of education, pain medication management by a pharmacist, physiotherapy-guided exercise, and communication with the primary care physician. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were determined for patients assigned to each treatment and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were determined. RESULTS: From the Ministry of Health perspective, the average patient in the intervention group generated slightly higher costs compared with usual care. Similar findings were obtained when using the societal perspective. The intervention resulted in ICERs of $232 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] -1,530, 2,154) per QALY gained from the Ministry of Health perspective and $14,395 (95% CI 7,826, 23,132) per QALY gained from the societal perspective, compared with usual care.

These carers frequently develop clinical depression or anxiety, which predicts care breakdown. We aimed to assess the clinical effectiveness (long-term reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms in family carers) and cost-effectiveness of a psychological intervention called START (STrAtegies for RelaTives). METHODS: We did a randomised, parallel-group trial with masked outcome assessments in three UK mental-health services and one neurological-outpatient dementia service. We included self-identified family carers of people with dementia who had been referred in the previous year and gave support at least once per week to the person with dementia. We randomly assigned these carers, via an online computer-generated randomisation system from an independent clinical trials unit, to either START, an 8-session, manual-based coping intervention delivered by supervised psychology graduates, or treatment as usual (TAU). The primary long-term outcomes were affective symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale total score [HADS-T]) 2 years after randomisation and cost-effectiveness (health and social care perspectives) over 24 months. Analysis was by intention to treat, excluding carers with data missing at both 12 and 24 months. This trial is registered ISCTRN70017938. FINDINGS: From November 4, 2009, to June 8, 2011, we recruited 260 carers. 173 carers were randomly assigned to START and 87 to TAU. Of these 260 participants, 209 (80%) were included in the clinical efficacy analysis (140 START, 69 TAU). At 24 months, compared with TAU the START group was significantly better for HADS-T (mean difference -2.58 points, 95% CI -4.26 to -0.90; p=0.003). The intervention is cost effective for both carers and patients (67% probability of cost-effectiveness at the pound20 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, and 70% at the pound30 000 threshold). INTERPRETATION: START is clinically effective, improving carer mood and anxiety levels for 2 years. Carers in the control TAU group were seven times more likely to have clinically significant depression than those receiving START. START is cost effective with respect to carer and patient outcomes, and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) thresholds. The number of people with dementia is rapidly growing, and policy frameworks assume that their families will remain the frontline providers of (unpaid) support.

Whereas there is considerable literature regarding which management approach is superior, there are only a few studies addressing the cost of treating VSs, and there are no cost-utility analyses in the US to date. Methods In this study, the authors used the University of California at San Francisco medical record and hospital accounting databases to determine total hospital charges and costs for 33 patients who underwent open surgery, 42 patients who had GKS, and 12 patients who were observed between 2010 and 2013. The authors then performed decision-tree analysis to determine which treatment paradigm produces the highest quality-adjusted life years and to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, depending on the patient's age at VS diagnosis. Results The average total hospital cost over a 3-year period for surgically treated patients was $80,074 (+/- $49,678) versus $9737 (+/- $5522) for patients receiving radiosurgery and $1746 (+/- $2792) for patients who were observed.

13719,Early health economic evaluation of the future potential of next generation artificial vision systems for treating blindness in Germany,"The next generation of artificial vision devices (AVDs), which is currently developed in pre-clinical settings, has the potential to improve the vision of blind patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) in a manner that they will be categorized as visual impaired but no more as blind. This unprecedented vision improvement will result in a mentionable quality of life gain which poses the question at which costs the next generation AVDs are to be regarded as cost-effective, from a German healthcare payer perspective. In order to answer this research question a Markov model was developed to simulate and to compare the costs and effects of next generation AVDs versus best supportive care (BSC). Applying the base case settings resulted in incremental costs of <euro>107,925, in 2.03 incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and in a cost-effectiveness ratio of <euro>53,165 per QALY gained. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses as well as scenario analyses for the effect size and the AVD costs were performed in order to investigate the robustness of results. In these scenario analyses a strong variation of the cost-effectiveness results was obtained ranging from <euro>23,512 (best case) to <euro>176,958 (worst case) per QALY gained by AVD therapy. This early health economic evaluation has to handle with three main uncertainty factors: the effect size of next generation AVDs, the costs of next generation AVDs and the WTP threshold that might be applied in RP patients, which reflect the main limitations of the presented assessment. In conclusion the presented early cost-effectiveness evaluation has obtained that next generation AVDs have the potential to be a cost-effective therapy option in patients with RP in Germany. The innovative nature, the high unmet medical need and the expected unprecedented efficacy of next generation AVDs will highly likely lead to the case that even relatively high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, that have been obtained when simulating various effect and pricing scenarios, will be regarded as acceptable from a German healthcare payer perspective.",2014-01-17591,26208927,Health Econ Rev,Bjoern Schwander,2014,4 / 1,27,No,26208927,"Bjoern Schwander; Early health economic evaluation of the future potential of next generation artificial vision systems for treating blindness in Germany, Health Econ Rev, 2014 Dec; 4(1):2191-1991; 27",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Artificial vision device vs. Standard/Usual Care- Best supportive care (BSC),Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,Not Stated,Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,53165,Euro,2014,77283.78

METHODS: A one-year decision tree and a long-term Markov model were constructed to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). For the first year, data from PLATO (NCT00391872) were used to estimate the rate of cardiovascular events, resource use, and QALYs. For year 2 onwards, clinical effectiveness was estimated conditional on individual health states that occurred during the first year. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with ticagrelor was 292,504 ($9,476) and 60,055 ($1,946) THB($)/QALY compared with generic and branded clopidogrel, respectively. The probability of ticagrelor being cost-effective was above 99% at a threshold of 160,000 THB/QALY compared with branded clopidogrel.

STUDY DESIGN: Two separate Markov models evaluated the cost-effectiveness analysis of hypertension (HT) screening and screening on metabolic syndrome (MetS), respectively, as compared to current practice in women with a history of term hypertensive pregnancy disorders. Analyses were performed from the Dutch health care perspective, using a lifetime horizon. One-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation evaluated the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Both screening on HT and MetS in women with a history of gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia resulted in increase in life expectancy (HT screening 0.23year (95% CI -0.06 to 0.54); MetS screening 0.14years (95% CI -0.16 to 0.45)). The gain in QALYs was limited, with HT screening and MetS screening generating 0.04 QALYs (95% CI -0.12 to 0.20) and 0.03 QALYs (95% CI -0.14 to 0.19), resulting in costs to gain one QALY of euro4228 and euro28,148, respectively.

13731,The cost-effectiveness of primary care referral to a UK commercial weight loss programme,"Primary care referral to commercial weight loss programmes that follow best practice is included in current UK guidance on the management of adult obesity. This study investigated whether such a programme was cost-effective compared with usual care. A decision-analytical Markov model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and benefits of the referral programme compared with usual care and enable a cost-utility analysis. The model cohort transited between body mass index classifications and type 2 diabetes, stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) with risk, cost and effect parameter values taken from published literature. The cost per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was calculated. Extensive deterministic and scenario sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted. At 12 months, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound6906, indicating that programme referral was cost-effective. Over a lifetime, referral to the commercial programme was dominant as it led to a cost saving of pound924 and conferred incremental benefit (0.22 QALY) over usual care. Model simulations estimated lower lifetime rates of type 2 diabetes, stroke and MI as a result of the weight loss achieved. The results were robust to extensive sensitivity analyses. The PSA indicated that programme referral had a 68% chance of being cost-effective at a willingness to pay per incremental QALY threshold of pound20,000. Referral to the programme dominated usual care, being both cheaper and more effective. These results compare favourably with economic evaluations of other obesity interventions and add to a growing evidence base on the cost-effectiveness of commercial weight loss providers and practices.",2014-01-18410,25826162,Int Forum Allergy Rhinol,D M Meads,2014,4 / 6,324-32,No,25826162,"D M Meads; C T Hulme; P Hall; A J Hill; The cost-effectiveness of primary care referral to a UK commercial weight loss programme, Int Forum Allergy Rhinol, 2014 Dec; 4(6):2042-6984; 324-32",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Commercial weight loss programme consisting of weekly group weight management sessions plus additional support in between group meetings vs. Standard/Usual Care- Information provision without an active component,Not Stated,47 Years,47 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-4197.86,United Kingdom,2012,-7501.85
13732,Cost-effectiveness of navigated radiofrequency ablation for hepatocellular carcinoma in China,"OBJECTIVES: Real-time virtual sonography (RVS) is a promising navigation technique for percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment, especially in ablating nodules poorly visualized on conventional ultrasonography (US). However, its cost-effectiveness has not been established. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RVS navigated RFA (RVS-RFA) relative to US guided RFA (US-RFA) in patients with small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in China, from the modified societal perspective. METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was created using TreeAge Pro 2012. The parameters used in the model, including natural history of HCC patients, procedure efficacy and related costs, were obtained from a systematic search of literature through PubMed, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index databases. The simulated cohort was patients with solitary, small HCC (<3 cm in diameter) and Child-Pugh class A or B, whose tumors are poorly visualized in B-mode US but clearly detectable by CT or MRI. RESULTS: In this cohort of difficult cases, RVS-RFA was a preferred strategy saving 2,467 CNY ($392) throughout the patient's life while gaining additional 1.4 QALYs compared with conventional US guidance. The results were sensitive to the efficacy of US-RFA and RVS-RFA including complete ablation rate and local recurrence rate, the median survival for patients with progressive HCC, the probability of performing RFA for recurrent HCC, and the cost of RVS navigation, disposable needle or hospitalization.

STUDY DESIGN: Economic evaluation using a decision tree model. SETTING: Academic and nonacademic otolaryngology practices. SUBJECTS: Patients with refractory chronic rhinosinusitis undergoing ESS. METHODS: The economic perspective was the health care third party payer. Effectiveness and probability data were obtained from a single meta-analysis of 2 randomized, double-blind, controlled trials. Costs were obtained from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services database and wholesale pharmaceutical pricing. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed including a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Comparative treatment groups were (1) placement of the mometasone steroid-eluting sinus implant following ESS and (2) placement of a nonsteroid-eluting implant following ESS. The primary outcome was cost per postoperative intervention avoided within 60 days after ESS. RESULTS: The mean cost for the steroid-eluting and nonsteroid-eluting sinus implant strategies were $1,572.91 and $365.18, respectively. The steroid-eluting strategy incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $5,489.68. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated a 74.3%, 87.2%, and 90.5% certainty that the steroid-eluting implant strategy is cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $10,000, $25,000, and $50,000, respectively.

13734,"Economic evaluation of warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation","BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for stroke, which causes thousands of deaths and sequelae. It is recommended that atrial fibrillation patients at medium or high risk of stroke use an oral anticoagulant to reduce the risk of stroke. In the past few years, three new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been introduced in competition to the older oral anticoagulant warfarin. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban in a Norwegian setting. METHODS: We created a probabilistic decision-analytic Markov model to simulate the life of patients with atrial fibrillation. We performed several scenario analyses, including changing the switching age for dabigatran from 80 to 75 years old. RESULTS: Assuming the European Society of Cardiology guidance, sequential dabigatran (2 x 150 mg daily until 80 years old, 2 x 110 mg thereafter) seems to be the most cost-effective alternative for high-risk AF patients. For medium-risk patients, apixaban (2 x 5 mg daily) seems to be somewhat more effective than dabigatran, but dabigatran is still marginally the most cost-effective alternative. In scenario analyses reducing dabigatran from 2 x 150 mg to 2 x 110 mg at the age of 75 years (instead of at age 80), apixaban (2 x 5 mg daily) becomes the most cost-effective alternative for both risk groups.

13736,"Economic evaluation of warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation","BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for stroke, which causes thousands of deaths and sequelae. It is recommended that atrial fibrillation patients at medium or high risk of stroke use an oral anticoagulant to reduce the risk of stroke. In the past few years, three new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban, have been introduced in competition to the older oral anticoagulant warfarin. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of warfarin, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban in a Norwegian setting. METHODS: We created a probabilistic decision-analytic Markov model to simulate the life of patients with atrial fibrillation. We performed several scenario analyses, including changing the switching age for dabigatran from 80 to 75 years old. RESULTS: Assuming the European Society of Cardiology guidance, sequential dabigatran (2 x 150 mg daily until 80 years old, 2 x 110 mg thereafter) seems to be the most cost-effective alternative for high-risk AF patients. For medium-risk patients, apixaban (2 x 5 mg daily) seems to be somewhat more effective than dabigatran, but dabigatran is still marginally the most cost-effective alternative.

13738,Comparing the cost effectiveness of harm reduction strategies: a case study of the Ukraine,"BACKGROUND: Harm reduction strategies commonly include needle and syringe programmes (NSP), opioid substitution therapy (OST) and interventions combining these two strategies. Despite the proven effectiveness of harm-reduction strategies in reducing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection among injecting drug users (IDUs), no study has compared the cost-effectiveness of these interventions, nor the incremental cost effectiveness of combined therapy. Using data from the Global Fund, this study compares the cost-effectiveness of harm reduction strategies in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, using the Ukraine as a case study. METHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo simulation is carried out using parameters from the literature and cost data from the Global Fund. Effectiveness is presented as both QALYs and infections averted. Costs are measured in 2011 US dollars. RESULTS: The Markov Monte Carlo simulation estimates the cost-effectiveness ratio per infection averted as $487.4 [95% CI: 488.47-486.35] in NSP and $1145.9 [95% CI: 1143.39-1148.43] in OST. Combined intervention is more costly but more effective than the alternative strategies with a cost effectiveness ratio of $851.6[95% CI: 849.82-853.55]. The ICER of the combined strategy is $1086.9/QALY [95% CI: 1077.76:1096.24] compared with NSP, and $461.0/infection averted [95% CI: 452.98:469.04] compared with OST. These results are consistent with previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the inherent limitations of retrospective data, this study provides evidence that harm-reduction interventions are a cost-effective way to reduce HIV prevalence. More research on into cost effectiveness in different settings, and the availability of fiscal space for government uptake of programmes, is required.",2014-01-19253,25873788,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Sung Wook Kim,2014,12 /,25,Yes,25873788,"Sung Wook Kim; Anni-Maria Pulkki-Brannstrom; Jolene Skordis-Worrall; Comparing the cost effectiveness of harm reduction strategies: a case study of the Ukraine, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, ; 12():1478-7547; 25",QALY,Ukraine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Combined strategy: needle and syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy vs. Needle and syringe programmes (NSP),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,1086.9,United States,2011,1250.57
