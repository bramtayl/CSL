7701,Cost-effectiveness of substituting dual-energy CT for SPECT in the assessment of myocardial perfusion for the workup of coronary artery disease,"PURPOSE: We compared cost-effectiveness and potential lifetime benefits of using dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) for myocardial perfusion assessment instead of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the workup of coronary artery disease (CAD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision and simulation model was developed to estimate cost and health effects of using DECT myocardial perfusion imaging instead of SPECT for identifying patients in need of invasive imaging and possible revascularization. The model was based on the performance indices of stress/rest DECT compared with stress/rest SPECT for detecting myocardial perfusion deficits in 50 patients (mean age 61±10 years) with CAD. Stress/rest perfusion and delayed enhancement cardiac MRI served as reference standard. For DECT a reimbursement of US$1700 was assumed but costs of cardiac MRI were not included in the model. All other actual healthcare costs in these patients were derived from MUSC's hospital billing system. RESULTS: Compared with cardiac MRI, DECT (versus SPECT) had 90% (85%) sensitivity and 71% (58%) specificity for identifying patients with obstructive CAD. Compared with the no imaging and no treatment strategy, routine SPECT gained 13.49 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$3557 (in 2010) per QALY. In comparison, DECT ICER was lower (US$3.191 per QALY, p=0.0002) and an additional 0.64 QALYs was obtained (total of 14.13 QALYs) if compared with the SPECT strategy as well as the no imaging and no treatment strategy. CONCLUSION: Using DECT as the first-line imaging test for myocardial perfusion for the workup of patients with CAD has the potential to provide gains in QALYs, while lowering costs if compared to routine myocardial perfusion SPECT.",2011-01-07176,21277132,Eur J Radiol,Mathias Meyer,2011,/,,No,21277132,"Mathias Meyer; John W Nance; U Joseph Schoepf; Antonio Moscariello; Markus Weininger; Garrett W Rowe; Balazs Ruzsics; Doo Kyoung Kang; Salvatore A Chiaramida; Stefan O Schoenberg; Christian Fink; Thomas Henzler; Cost-effectiveness of substituting dual-energy CT for SPECT in the assessment of myocardial perfusion for the workup of coronary artery disease, Eur J Radiol, 2011-Jan-27; ():1872-7727",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) vs. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-479.69,United States,2008,-576.62

7703,The Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Genetic Medicine: The case of genetic testing in neonatal diabetes,"OBJECTIVE Neonatal diabetes mellitus is a rare form of diabetes diagnosed in infancy. Nearly half of patients with permanent neonatal diabetes have mutations in the genes for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KCNJ11 and ABCC8) that allow switching from insulin to sulfonylurea therapy. Although treatment conversion has dramatic benefits, the cost-effectiveness of routine genetic testing is unknown. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We conducted a societal cost-utility analysis comparing a policy of routine genetic testing to no testing among children with permanent neonatal diabetes. We used a simulation model of type 1 diabetic complications, with the outcome of interest being the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, $/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) over 30 years of follow-up. RESULTS In the base case, the testing policy dominated the no-testing policy. The testing policy was projected to bring about quality-of-life benefits that enlarged over time (0.32 QALYs at 10 years, 0.70 at 30 years) and produced savings in total costs that were present as early as 10 years ($12,528 at 10 years, $30,437 at 30 years). Sensitivity analyses indicated that the testing policy would remain cost-saving as long as the prevalence of the genetic defects remained >3% and would retain an ICER <$200,000/QALY at prevalences between 0.7 and 3%. CONCLUSIONS Genetic testing in neonatal diabetes improves quality of life and lowers costs. This paradigmatic case study highlights the potential economic impact of applying the concepts of personalized genetic medicine to other disorders in the future.",2011-01-07183,21273495,Diabetes Care,Siri Atma W Greeley,2011,34 / 3,622-7,No,21273495,"Siri Atma W Greeley; Priya M John; Aaron N Winn; Joseph Ornelas; Rebecca B Lipton; Louis H Philipson; Graeme I Bell; Elbert S Huang; The Cost-Effectiveness of Personalized Genetic Medicine: The case of genetic testing in neonatal diabetes, Diabetes Care, 2011-Mar; 34(3):0149-5992; 622-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genetic testing in the genes for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KCNJ11 and ABCC8) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,-43481.43,United States,2008,-52268.07
7704,Is mechanical clot removal or disruption a cost-effective treatment for acute stroke?,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is unclear whether the costs and risks of mechanical therapies make them cost-effective. We examined whether interventions such as mechanical clot removal or disruption with angioplasty are cost-effective for acute ischemic stroke compared with best medical therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis of patients with acute stroke due to large intracranial artery occlusion presenting beyond the 3-hour window for IV tPA. Model inputs for the mechanical arm were derived from Multi MERCI trial data and a recent meta-analysis. For best medical therapy, we used rates of spontaneous recanalization, ICH, and functional outcomes based on a systematic literature review. Discounted QALYs were determined by using the Markov modeling for 65-year-old patients with acute ischemic stroke. RESULTS: On the basis of a systematic literature review, we modeled an 84% rate of recanalization with mechanical intervention and a 6.3% rate of symptomatic ICH. For best medical therapy, we modeled a spontaneous recanalization rate of 24% with a 2% rate of symptomatic ICH. Mechanical therapies were associated with a $7718 net cost and a gain of a 0.82 QALYs for each use, thus yielding a net of $9386/QALY gained. In sensitivity analyses, results were dependent on the rates of recanalization, symptomatic ICH rates, and costs of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of available data, mechanical therapies in qualified patients with acute stroke beyond the window for IV tPA appear to be cost-effective. However, the inputs are not derived from randomized trials, and results are sensitive to several assumptions.",2011-01-07184,21273349,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,M N Nguyen-Huynh,2011,32 / 2,244-9,No,21273349,"M N Nguyen-Huynh; S C Johnston; Is mechanical clot removal or disruption a cost-effective treatment for acute stroke?, AJNR Am J Neuroradiol, 2011-Feb; 32(2):0195-6108; 244-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Neurointerventional radiology (NIR) to mechanically remove or disrupt a stroke causing clot vs. Best medical therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,9386,United States,2009,11322.99
7705,Cost-utility analysis of a one-time supervisor telephone contact at 6-weeks post-partum to prevent extended sick leave following maternity leave in The Netherlands: results of an economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Working women of childbearing age are a vital part of the population. Following childbirth, this group of women can experience a myriad of physical and mental health problems that can interfere with their ability to work. Currently, there is little known about cost-effective post-partum interventions to prevent work disability. The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether supervisor telephone contact (STC) during maternity leave is cost-effective from a societal perspective in reducing sick leave and improving quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to common practice (CP). METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial. QALYs were measured by the EuroQol 5-D, and sick leave and presenteeism by the Health and work Performance Questionnaire. Resource use was collected by questionnaires. Data were analysed according to intention-to-treat. Missing data were imputed via multiple imputation. Uncertainty was estimated by 95% confidence intervals, cost-utility planes and curves, and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: 541 working women from 15 companies participated. Response rates were above 85% at each measurement moment. At the end of the follow-up, no statistically significant between-group differences in QALYs, mean hours of sick leave or presenteeism or costs were observed. STC was found to be less effective and more costly. For willingness-to-pay levels from €0 through €50,000, the probability that STC was cost-effective compared to CP was 0.2. Overall resource use was low. Mean total costs were €3678 (95% CI: 3386; 3951). Productivity loss costs represented 37% of the total costs and of these costs, 48% was attributable to sick leave and 52% to work presenteeism. The cost analysis from a company's perspective indicated that there was a net cost associated with the STC intervention. CONCLUSIONS: STC was not cost-effective compared to common practice for a healthy population of working mothers; therefore, implementation is not indicated. The cost-utility of STC for working mothers with more severe post-partum health problems, however, needs to be investigated. Work presenteeism accounted for half of the total productivity loss and warrants attention in future studies.",2011-01-07185,21272325,BMC Public Health,Kimi Uegaki,2011,11 / 1,57,No,21272325,"Kimi Uegaki; Suzanne G M Stomp-van den Berg; Martine C de Bruijne; Mireille N M van Poppel; Martijn W Heymans; Willem van Mechelen; Maurits W van Tulder; Cost-utility analysis of a one-time supervisor telephone contact at 6-weeks post-partum to prevent extended sick leave following maternity leave in The Netherlands: results of an economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial, BMC Public Health, 2011; 11(1):1471-2458; 57",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Telephone contact from supervisor for the purpose of preventing prolonged non-treatment of latent post-partum health problems vs. Current practice: no telephone contact from supervisor,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-25285.71,Euro,2006,-40781.04
7706,Cost-Effectiveness of the Combination Therapy of Dutasteride and Tamsulosin in the Treatment of Benign Prostatic Hyperlasia in Spain,"OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the combination therapy with dutasteride and tamsulosin (DUT+TAM) as initiation treatment versus the most used drug in Spain, tamsulosin (TAM), in the treatment of moderate to severe benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) with risk of progression. METHODS: a semi-Markov model was developed using 4-year and 35-year time horizons and from the Spanish National Healthcare Service perspective. Data were obtained from the CombAT trial. Effectiveness was measured in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Health care resources were defined by an experts' panel, and unitary costs were obtained from published Spanish sources. Pharmacologic cost is expressed in PTP(WAT); in the case of TAM, the generic price is used, in the case of DUT+TAM the price of a fixed dose combination is used. Costs are expressed in 2010 Euros. RESULTS: combination therapy with DUT+TAM produces an incremental effectiveness of 0.06QALY at year 4 and 0.4QALY at year 35. DUT+TAM represents an incremental cost of € 810.53 at 4 years and € 3,443.62 at 35 years. Therefore, the ICER for DUT+TAM versus TAM is € 14,023.32/QALY at year 4 and € 8,750.15/QALY at year 35.

7708,Economic evaluation of new targeted therapies for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma,"Study Type - Therapy (economic) Level of Evidence 2b OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic value of targeted therapies as first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treatment in the US and Sweden by indirect comparison of survival data. METHODS: A Markov model simulated disease progression, adverse events and survival with sunitinib vs sorafenib in the US and bevacizumab plus interferon-a (IFN-a) in both countries. Results, in life-years (LYs), progression-free LYs (PFLYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) gained and treatment costs (2008 USD) were obtained through deterministic and probabilistic analyses over the patient's lifetime. RESULTS: Sunitinib was more effective and less costly than sorafenib (gains of 0.52 PFLYs, 0.16 LYs and 0.17 QALYs and savings/patient of $13 576 in the US) and bevacizumab plus IFN-a (gains of 0.19 PFLYs, 0.23 LYs and 0.16 QALYs in both countries and savings/patient of $67 798 and $47 264 in the US and Sweden, respectively). Results were most influenced by hazard ratios for progression-free and overall survival and treatment costs, making results generalizable across other countries if relative costs were to fall within the ranges of those in the US and Sweden.

7711,Cost-effectiveness of olanzapine long-acting injection in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in the United States: a micro-simulation economic decision model,"Abstract Objective: To compare, from the perspective of third-party payers in the United States health care system, the cost-effectiveness of olanzapine long-acting injection (LAI, depot) with alternative antipsychotic agents including risperidone-LAI, paliperidone-LAI, haloperidol-LAI, and oral olanzapine, in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia who have been non-adherent or partially adherent with oral antipsychotics. Research design and methods: A 1-year micro-simulation economic decision model was developed to simulate the dynamics of usual care of patients with schizophrenia who continue, discontinue, switch, or restart their medication. The model uses a range of clinical and cost parameters including adherence levels, relapse with and without hospitalization, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), treatment discontinuation rates by reason, treatment-emergent adverse events, suicide, health care resource utilization, and direct health care costs. Published medical literature and a clinical expert panel were used to develop baseline model assumptions. Outcome measures: Key model outputs include annual total direct cost (US$) per treatment and incremental cost-effectiveness values per additional QALY gained. Results: Model results found that the olanzapine-LAI treatment strategy was more effective (greater QALYs) and less costly than risperidone-LAI, paliperidone-LAI, and haloperidol-LAI. In addition, olanzapine-LAI was both more effective and more costly, with an estimated incremental cost/QALY of $26,824 compared to oral olanzapine. The base-case and multiple sensitivity analyses found olanzapine-LAI to remain within acceptable cost-effective ranges (<$50,000) in terms of incremental cost/QALY gained. Conclusions: This micro-simulation model finds the olanzapine-LAI treatment strategy to result in better effectiveness and to be a cost-effective alternative compared to oral olanzapine and the LAI formulations of risperidone, paliperidone, and haloperidol in the treatment of non-adherent and partially adherent patients with schizophrenia in the United States.

Research design and methods: A 1-year micro-simulation economic decision model was developed to simulate the dynamics of usual care of patients with schizophrenia who continue, discontinue, switch, or restart their medication. The model uses a range of clinical and cost parameters including adherence levels, relapse with and without hospitalization, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), treatment discontinuation rates by reason, treatment-emergent adverse events, suicide, health care resource utilization, and direct health care costs. Published medical literature and a clinical expert panel were used to develop baseline model assumptions. Outcome measures: Key model outputs include annual total direct cost (US$) per treatment and incremental cost-effectiveness values per additional QALY gained. Results: Model results found that the olanzapine-LAI treatment strategy was more effective (greater QALYs) and less costly than risperidone-LAI, paliperidone-LAI, and haloperidol-LAI. In addition, olanzapine-LAI was both more effective and more costly, with an estimated incremental cost/QALY of $26,824 compared to oral olanzapine.

7715,Improving patient access to cancer drugs in India: Using economic modeling to estimate a more affordable drug cost based on measures of societal value,"BACKGROUND: Using multiples of India's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as the threshold for economic value as suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO), decision analysis modeling was used to estimate a more affordable monthly cost in India for a hypothetical new cancer drug that provides a 3-month survival benefit to Indian patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). METHODS: A decision model was developed to simulate progression-free and overall survival in mCRC patients receiving chemotherapy with and without the new drug. Costs for chemotherapy and side-effects management were obtained from both public and private hospitals in India. Utility estimates measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were determined by interviewing twenty-four oncology nurses using the Time Trade-Off technique. The monthly cost of the new drug was then estimated using a target threshold of US$9,300 per QALY gained, which is three times the Indian per capita GDP. RESULTS: The base-case analysis suggested that a price of US$98.00 per dose would be considered cost-effective from the Indian public healthcare perspective. If the drug were able to improve patient quality of life above the standard of care or survival from 3 to 6 months, the price per dose could increase to US$170 and US$253 and offer the same value. CONCLUSIONS: The use of the WHO criteria for estimating the cost of a new drug based on economic value for a developing country like India is feasible and can be used to estimate a more affordable cost based on societal value thresholds.",2011-01-07198,21262084,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,George Dranitsaris,2011,27 / 1,23-30,No,21262084,"George Dranitsaris; Ilse Truter; Martie S Lubbe; Nitin N Sriramanakoppa; Vivian M Mendonca; Sangameshwar B Mahagaonkar; Improving patient access to cancer drugs in India: Using economic modeling to estimate a more affordable drug cost based on measures of societal value, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2011-Jan; 27(1):0266-4623; 23-30",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) with bevacizumab followed by irinotecan (FOLFIR) vs. Oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) followed by irinotecan (FOLFIR),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,9300,United States,2009,11219.24
7716,Economic evaluation of four follow-up strategies after curative treatment for breast cancer: Results of an RCT,"BACKGROUND: An economic evaluation was performed alongside a randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN 74071417) investigating the cost-effectiveness of nurse-led telephone follow-up instead of hospital visits, and of a short educational group programme (EGP) in the first year after breast cancer treatment. METHOD: This economic evaluation (n=299) compared the one-year costs and the effects of four follow-up strategies: (1) hospital follow-up; (2) nurse-led telephone follow-up; (3) hospital follow-up plus EGP; and (4) nurse-led telephone follow-up plus EGP. Costs were measured using cost diaries and hospital registrations. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured using the EQ-5D. Outcomes were expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: Hospital follow-up plus EGP yielded most QALYs (0.776), but also incurred the highest mean annual costs (€4914). The ICER of this strategy versus the next best alternative, nurse-led telephone follow-up plus EGP (0.772 QALYs and €3971), amounted to €235.750/QALY. Hospital and telephone follow-up without EGP both incurred higher costs and less QALYs than telephone follow-up plus EGP and were judged inferior. Hospital follow-up plus EGP was not considered cost-effective, therefore, telephone follow-up plus EGP was the preferred strategy. The probability of telephone follow-up plus EGP being cost-effective ranged from 49% to 62% for different QALY threshold values. Secondary and sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust.

7719,Treating pneumonia in critical care in the United Kingdom following failure of initial antibiotic: a cost-utility analysis comparing meropenem with piperacillin/tazobactam,"BACKGROUND: Treating patients admitted to critical care with severe pneumonia requires timely intervention with an effective antibiotic. This reduces the risk of dying of pneumonia and minimises complications associated with a prolonged stay in critical care. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of meropenem 1 g/8 h with piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g/8 h for treating pneumonia in UK critical care. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of using meropenem versus piperacillin/tazobactam to treat severe pneumonia. Estimates of effectiveness, utility weights and costs were obtained from published sources. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to address uncertainty in the model results. RESULTS: Cost of treating a patient with severe pneumonia was estimated as £19,026 with meropenem and £19,978 with piperacillin/tazobactam, respectively. QALYs gained were 4.768 with meropenem and 4.654 with piperacillin/tazobactam. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed meropenem to be consistently less costly and more effective than piperacillin/tazobactam. CONCLUSION: The additional efficacy of meropenem translates into more patients surviving critical care and leaving this high-cost service more quickly than if they had been treated with piperacillin/tazobactam. As meropenem is more effective and less expensive than piperacillin/tazobactam at treating patients with severe pneumonia, it is the dominant treatment option.",2011-01-07217,21243514,Eur J Health Econ,Steven J Edwards,2011,/,,Yes,21243514,"Steven J Edwards; Sarah Wordsworth; Mike J Clarke; Treating pneumonia in critical care in the United Kingdom following failure of initial antibiotic: a cost-utility analysis comparing meropenem with piperacillin/tazobactam, Eur J Health Econ, 2011-Jan-18; ():1618-7598",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Meropenem 1g/8h vs. Piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-8278.26,United Kingdom,2008,-18454.15

Methods: In total, 248 patients [mean age 57 (SD 13) years, 77% female] with inflammatory arthropathies underwent orthopaedic surgical treatment and responded to mail surveys at baseline and during follow-up (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Questionnaires included the quality-of-life EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and Short Form-6D (SF-6D) utility scores. The health benefit from surgery was subsequently translated into QALYs. The direct treatment costs in the first year were, for each patient, derived from the hospital's cost per patient accounting system (KOSPA). The costs per QALY were estimated and future costs and benefits were discounted at 4%. Results: Improvement in utility at 1-year follow-up was 0.10 with EQ-5D and 0.03 with SF-6D (p < 0.05).

7727,Effects of family history and genetic polymorphism on the cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention with finasteride for prostate cancer,"PURPOSE: Improvement in the cost-effectiveness of chemoprevention for prostate cancer could be realized through the identification of patients at higher risk. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer chemoprevention across risk groups defined by family history and number of risk alleles, and the cost-effectiveness of targeting chemoprevention to higher risk groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a probabilistic Markov model to estimate costs, survival and quality adjusted survival across risk groups for patients receiving or not receiving chemoprevention with finasteride. The model uses data from national cancer registries, online sources and the medical literature. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of 25 years of chemoprevention with finasteride in patients 50 years old was an estimated $89,300 per quality adjusted life-year (95% CI $58,800-$149,800), assuming finasteride decreased all grades of prostate cancer by 24.8%. Among patients with a positive family history (without genetic testing) chemoprevention provided 1 additional quality adjusted life-year at a cost of $64,200. Among patients with a negative family history at $400 per person tested, the cost-effectiveness of genetically targeted chemoprevention ranged from $98,100 per quality adjusted life-year when limiting finasteride to individuals with 14 or more risk alleles, to $103,200 per quality adjusted life-year when including those with 8 or more risk alleles.

7730,Cost-Effectiveness of Gemcitabine + Cisplatin vs. Gemcitabine Monotherapy in Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer,"OBJECTIVES: The ABC-02 trial demonstrated a statistically significant survival benefit associated with the addition of cisplatin to gemcitabine in the palliative treatment of advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). Based on the ABC-02 findings, this analysis seeks to evaluate the cost-utility of adding cisplatin to standard gemcitabine therapy from a U.S. societal perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate direct medical costs, patient time costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for two treatment strategies: (1) gemcitabine + cisplatin, (2) gemcitabine monotherapy. Model parameters were derived from the pivotal trial of gemcitabine + cisplatin in advanced BTC, published literature, and government sources. The model included trial-based adverse events and costs related to drug treatment, routine follow-up, adverse events, and post-progression care. The model results were examined using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). RESULTS: Total QALYs for the gemcitabine + cisplatin and gemcitabine monotherapy strategies were 0.751 and 0.561, respectively. Total costs were $44,885 and $33,653 respectively. Relative to gemcitabine monotherapy, gemcitabine + cisplatin had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $59,480 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses found results to be sensitive to progression-free survival, overall survival, pre and post-progression health state utility values, and the cost of post-progression care. In the PSA, gemcitabine monotherapy had the highest probability of being cost-effective until a willingness-to-pay of $60,000, after which the gemcitabine + cisplatin strategy had the highest probability. CONCLUSION: The results of this analysis suggest that in advanced BTC, the cisplatin + gemcitabine regimen is a cost-effective treatment alternative to gemcitabine monotherapy by currently accepted standards of willingness to pay.",2011-01-07224,21234709,J Gastrointest Cancer,Joshua A Roth,2011,/,,No,21234709,"Joshua A Roth; Josh J Carlson; Cost-Effectiveness of Gemcitabine + Cisplatin vs. Gemcitabine Monotherapy in Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer, J Gastrointest Cancer, 2011-Jan-15; ():1941-6636",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Gemcitabine + cisplatin vs. Gemcitabine monotherapy for a maximum of 24 weeks,Not Stated,63 Years,63 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,59480,United States,2009,71754.89
7731,Cost-effectiveness of atazanavir/ritonavir compared with lopinavir/ritonavir in treatment-naïve human immunodeficiency virus-1 patients in Sweden,"Abstract Objective: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of atazanavir/ritonavir (atazanavir/r) versus lopinavir/ritonavir (lopinavir/r) in treatment-naïve human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) patients in Sweden for whom efavirenz is not suitable. Methods: A Markov model was developed to predict the lifetime outcomes of atazanavir/r and lopinavir/r in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and total costs. The model was structured to focus on treatment lines - how patients progress from first- to second-, and then to third-line treatment. Model inputs were derived directly from clinical trials, such as the CASTLE study (a 96-week head-to-head trial in first-line therapy), and from the Framingham risk-equation. The analysis was conducted from a payer perspective and included extensive scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: The model predicted atazanavir/r to save 0.16 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.00 to 0.33) QALYs and reduce total costs by -202,896 SEK (95% CI -332,156 to -81,644 SEK) over a lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that atazanavir/r had a 100% probability to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of 200,000 SEK per QALY. Conclusion: The results indicate that atazanavir/r is cost-saving and more effective compared to lopinavir/r for patients who have previously not been exposed to antiretroviral drugs in Sweden.",2011-01-07227,21231811,Scand J Infect Dis,Per-Olof Thuresson,2011,43 / 4,304-12,No,21231811,"Per-Olof Thuresson; Bart Heeg; Benedicte Lescrauwaet; Karin Sennf?lt; Annette Alaeus; Aljoscha Neubauer; Cost-effectiveness of atazanavir/ritonavir compared with lopinavir/ritonavir in treatment-naïve human immunodeficiency virus-1 patients in Sweden, Scand J Infect Dis, 2011-Apr; 43(4):0036-5548; 304-12",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Atazanavir in addition to ritonavir vs. Lopinavir in addition to ritonavir,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-1268100,Sweden,2007,-234625.44
7732,"The cost effectiveness of zoledronic acid 5mg for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women with prior fractures: evidence from Finland, Norway and the Netherlands","OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the cost effectiveness of zoledronic acid 5?mg as a first-line treatment for the secondary prevention of fragility fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis in Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. METHODS: A discrete-event, individual-patient computer-simulation model was used to compare the cost effectiveness of zoledronic acid with that of basic treatment (calcium and vitamin D) and commonly prescribed bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women aged 50-80 years who have experienced one previous fracture and have a bone mineral density T-score of -2.5. RESULTS: The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with zoledronic acid compared with basic treatment ranged from being cost saving in all age groups in Norway, to costing approximately €19,000 in Finland and €22,300 in the Netherlands. Compared with the other branded bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid was cost saving in many scenarios, including all age groups in Finland. In Norway, zoledronic acid dominated branded risedronate and ibandronate in all age groups and dominated or had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of up to NOK83,954 per QALY gained compared with branded alendronate. In the Netherlands, zoledronic acid dominated branded intravenous ibandronate in all age groups; compared with branded risedronate and oral ibandronate, zoledronic acid dominated or had ICERs of up to €4832 per QALY gained; compared with branded alendronate, it had ICERs of up to €48,383 per QALY gained. In all three countries, zoledronic acid may be cost effective compared with generic alendronate when patient compliance with drug therapy is taken into account. Sensitivity analyses showed that the model was robust to changes in key values. The main model limitations were the lack of real-life compliance and persistence data, and lack of country-specific data for some parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Using local or commonly used thresholds, this analysis suggests that zoledronic acid would be a cost-effective first-line option compared with other branded bisphosphonates and, in some scenarios, compared with generic alendronate, for the secondary prevention of fractures in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis in Finland, Norway and the Netherlands.",2011-01-07238,21222506,J Med Econ,R Akehurst,2011,14 / 1,53-64,Yes,21222506,"R Akehurst; N Brereton; R Ariely; T Lusa; M Groot; P Foss; S Boonen; The cost effectiveness of zoledronic acid 5mg for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis in women with prior fractures: evidence from Finland, Norway and the Netherlands, J Med Econ, 2011; 14(1):1369-6998; 53-64",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Zoledronic acid vs. Basic treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,22300,Euro,2006,35965.65

7735,Projected cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction,"BACKGROUND: As many as 70% of smokers with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) continue to smoke after hospital discharge despite high rates of inpatient smoking cessation counseling. Supportive contact after discharge improves quit rates but is rarely used. METHODS: Using data from a meta-analysis of randomized trials of smoking cessation interventions and other published sources, we developed a Monte Carlo model to project health and economic outcomes for a hypothetical US cohort of 327,600 smokers hospitalized with AMI. We compared routine care, consisting of advice to quit smoking, with counseling with supportive follow-up, consisting of routine care and follow-up telephone calls from a nurse after discharge. Primary outcomes were number of smokers, AMIs, and deaths averted; health care and productivity costs; cost per quitter; and cost per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: Implementation of smoking cessation counseling with follow-up contact for the 2010 cohort of hospitalized smokers would create 50,230 new quitters, cost $27.3 million in nurse wages and materials, and prevent 1380 nonfatal AMIs and 7860 deaths. During a 10-year period, it would save $22.1 million in reduced hospitalizations but increase health care costs by $166.4 million, primarily through increased longevity. Productivity costs from premature death would fall by $1.99 billion and nonmedical expenditures would increase by $928 million, for a net positive value to society of $894 million. The program would cost $540 per quitter considering only intervention costs. Cost-effectiveness would be $5050 per quality-adjusted life-year. Results were sensitive to the utility and incidence of nonfatal AMI and the potential effect of pharmacotherapies. CONCLUSION: Smoking cessation counseling with supportive contact after discharge is potentially cost-effective and may reduce the incidence of smoking and its associated adverse health events and social costs.",2011-01-07240,21220659,Arch Intern Med,Joseph A Ladapo,2011,171 / 1,39-45,No,21220659,"Joseph A Ladapo; Farouc A Jaffer; Milton C Weinstein; Erika Sivarajan Froelicher; Projected cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions in patients hospitalized with myocardial infarction, Arch Intern Med, 2011-Jan-10; 171(1):0003-9926; 39-45",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Smoking cessation counseling with supportive contact after discharge vs. Routine care (quit smoking advice),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,5050,United States,2008,6070.49
7736,Incremental cost-effectiveness of various monthly doses of vardenafil,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of four, six, and eight doses per month of vardenafil in the context of pharmacy benefit decision making. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of zero, four, six, or eight doses of vardenafil per month in hypothetical cohorts of 60-year-old male veterans with erectile dysfunction. Efficacy values for vardenafil were obtained from the literature, and vardenafil costs were obtained from Veterans Affairs pharmacy data. The analysis was conducted from a third-party payer perspective with a lifetime horizon, and the effect of parameter uncertainty was explored in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained for four doses of vardenafil per month compared with no therapy was $576. Six doses per month compared with four cost $2585/quality-adjusted life-year gained, and eight doses per month compared with six cost $5169/quality-adjusted life-year gained. In one-way sensitivity analyses of six doses per month compared with four, variation of two parameters caused the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to cross a willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000: when the increased utility associated with giving two additional doses/month was less than 0.001 (baseline 0.01) and when the cost per dose increased to $15.00 (baseline $1.69). CONCLUSION: Although four doses per month of vardenafil was the most cost-effective strategy, the use of six or eight doses per month also compares favorably with other accepted medical treatments.

7739,Cost-effectiveness of bivalirudin versus heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor in the treatment of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes,"OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of bivalirudin versus heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) in thienopyridine-treated non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) patients undergoing early or urgent invasive management, from a United Kingdom National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic model with lifelong time horizon was populated with event risks and resource use parameters derived from the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trial raw data. In a parallel analysis, key comparator strategy inputs came from Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) patients enrolled in the United Kingdom. Upstream and catheter laboratory-initiated GPI were assumed to be tirofiban and abciximab, respectively. Life expectancy of first-year survivors, unit costs, and health-state utilities came from United Kingdom sources. Costs and effects were discounted at 3.5%. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Higher acquisition costs for bivalirudin were partially offset by lower hospitalization and bleeding costs. In the ACUITY-based analysis, per-patient lifetime costs in the bivalirudin and heparin plus GPI strategies were £10,903 and £10,653, respectively. Patients survived 10.87 and 10.82 years on average, corresponding to 5.96 and 5.93 QALYs and resulting in an ICER of £9,906 per QALY gained. The GRACE-based ICER was £12,276 per QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 72.1% and 67.0% of simulation results were more cost-effective than £20,000 per QALY gained, in the ACUITY-based and GRACE-based analyses, respectively.

7741,Cost-effectiveness of infliximab for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis,"BACKGROUND: Despite its proven efficacy, infliximab is often considered to be an expensive treatment for patients with psoriatic arthritis. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of infliximab among patients with active and progressive psoriatic arthritis. METHODS: A decision analytic model was constructed to simulate disease progression in hypothetical cohorts of patients with psoriatic arthritis receiving infliximab maintenance treatment. The primary response measure was change in Health Assessment Questionnaire score from a baseline estimated from mixed treatment models drawn from published clinical trials. Palliative care, comprising nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, was used as a comparator. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years. The dose of infliximab was estimated for a range of 60 to 80 kg per patient body weight. The costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% for a period of 40 years. Uncertainty around the results was explored with probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The mixed treatment comparison showed a significant reduction in Health Assessment Questionnaire score across all patients. The tumor necrosis factor a inhibitors were significantly superior to palliative care but comparable with one another. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab relative to palliative care were £17,327; £19,246; and £16,942 to £23,022, respectively, across all patients with psoriatic arthritis and £16,613; £18,170; and £15,788 to £21,736, respectively, in the subgroup with significant psoriasis.

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to assess how cost-effective the WHI-DM would be if implemented as a public health intervention and under the sponsorship of private health insurers and Medicare. Breast and ovarian cancers are the health outcomes of interest. PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of WHI-DM participants form the target population for this analysis: participants consuming >36.8% of energy from fat at baseline, and participants at high risk for breast cancer with 32% or more of energy from fat at baseline. METHODS: This study uses Markov cohort modeling, following societal and health care payer perspectives, with Monte Carlo simulations and one-way sensitivity analyses. WHI-DM records, nationally representative prices, and published estimates of medical care costs were the sources of cost information. Simulations were performed for hypothetical cohorts of women aged 50, 55, 60, 65, or 70 years at the beginning of the intervention. Effectiveness was estimated by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Following the societal perspective, the ICERs for the 50-year old cohort are $13,773/QALY (95% confidence interval $7,482 to $20,916) for women consuming >36.8% of energy from fat at baseline and $10,544/QALY ($2,096 to $23,673) for women at high risk for breast cancer.

OBJECTIVE: The objective is to assess how cost-effective the WHI-DM would be if implemented as a public health intervention and under the sponsorship of private health insurers and Medicare. Breast and ovarian cancers are the health outcomes of interest. PARTICIPANTS: Two groups of WHI-DM participants form the target population for this analysis: participants consuming >36.8% of energy from fat at baseline, and participants at high risk for breast cancer with 32% or more of energy from fat at baseline. METHODS: This study uses Markov cohort modeling, following societal and health care payer perspectives, with Monte Carlo simulations and one-way sensitivity analyses. WHI-DM records, nationally representative prices, and published estimates of medical care costs were the sources of cost information. Simulations were performed for hypothetical cohorts of women aged 50, 55, 60, 65, or 70 years at the beginning of the intervention. Effectiveness was estimated by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Following the societal perspective, the ICERs for the 50-year old cohort are $13,773/QALY (95% confidence interval $7,482 to $20,916) for women consuming >36.8% of energy from fat at baseline and $10,544/QALY ($2,096 to $23,673) for women at high risk for breast cancer.

The comparable ICER from a private health care payer perspective is $66,059/QALY ($30,155 to $121,087) and from a Medicare perspective, it is $15,051/QALY ($6,565 to $25,105). CONCLUSIONS: The WHI-DM is a cost-effective strategy for the prevention of breast and ovarian cancers in the target population, from both societal and Medicare perspectives.

The objective of this phase III, randomized, multicenter, prospective study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of docetaxel and pemetrexed, two widely used drugs. METHODS: We compared, from a payer's perspective, the directs costs and effectiveness of docetaxel (75 mg/m, arm A) and pemetrexed (500 mg/m, arm B) administered every 3 weeks to NSCLC patients who had progressed after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Monthly health utilities (based on disease states: responding, stable or progressive, and grade 3/4 toxicities) were derived from the literature. Costs were prospectively assessed. RESULTS: One hundred fifty patients were enrolled between February 2006 and June 2008. The patients in the docetaxel and pemetrexed arms had similar clinical characteristics and treatment efficacy (respective objective response rates 10.7% and 12%; median progression-free survival times 2.8 and 2.5 months; median survival times 8.0 and 6.4 months, respectively). Grade 3/4 toxicities were significantly less frequent with pemetrexed (52.0% versus 33.3%, p = 0.02). Docetaxel was associated with lower treatment-period costs (€9709 ± €6272 versus €13,436 ± €6508, p < 0.001). Docetaxel had a more favorable cost-utility ratio than pemetrexed. When compared with best supportive care, the cost-utility was €32,652/quality-adjusted life year for docetaxel and €40,980/quality-adjusted life year for pemetrexed.

The cost-effectiveness of the new guidelines is unknown. DESIGN: comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness analysis using a model of HIV disease progression and treatment. METHODS: using a simulation of HIV disease and treatment in South Africa, we compared the life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs, and cost-effectiveness of five initial regimens. Four are currently recommended by the WHO: tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz; tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine; zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz; and zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. The fifth is the most common regimen in current use: stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Virologic suppression and toxicities determine regimen effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: choice of first-line regimen is associated with a difference of nearly 12 months of quality-adjusted life expectancy, from 135.2 months (tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz) to 123.7 months (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine). Stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine is more costly and less effective than zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Initiating treatment with a regimen containing tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine is associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1045 per quality-adjusted life year compared with zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Using tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz was associated with the highest survival, fewest opportunistic diseases, lowest rate of regimen substitution, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5949 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine. Zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz was more costly and less effective than tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine. Results were sensitive to the rates of toxicities and the disutility associated with each toxicity. CONCLUSION: among the options recommended by WHO, we estimate only three should be considered under normal circumstances. Choice among those depends on available resources and willingness to pay.

RESULTS: choice of first-line regimen is associated with a difference of nearly 12 months of quality-adjusted life expectancy, from 135.2 months (tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz) to 123.7 months (stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine). Stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine is more costly and less effective than zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Initiating treatment with a regimen containing tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine is associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1045 per quality-adjusted life year compared with zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine. Using tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz was associated with the highest survival, fewest opportunistic diseases, lowest rate of regimen substitution, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $5949 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine. Zidovudine/lamivudine/efavirenz was more costly and less effective than tenofovir/lamivudine/nevirapine. Results were sensitive to the rates of toxicities and the disutility associated with each toxicity. CONCLUSION: among the options recommended by WHO, we estimate only three should be considered under normal circumstances. Choice among those depends on available resources and willingness to pay.

7769,What treatment for early-stage glottic carcinoma among adult patients: CO2 endolaryngeal laser excision versus standard fractionated external beam radiation is superior in terms of cost utility?,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To determine which treatment for Tis/T1 glottic carcinoma among adult patients, transoral CO(2) laser excision (TOL) versus external beam radiation (XRT), is superior in terms of cost utility. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. METHODS: Six head-to-head comparison studies and 22 consecutive case series were identified to examine oncologic control. The case series were pooled as a composite group. Primary end points were local control (LC), laryngectomy-free survival (LFS), and overall survival (OS). Objective and subjective voice-quality measures were secondary end points. Third-party payer perspective was adopted for cost-utility analysis. Operational and capital costs were determined with the microcosting method. Rollback calculations and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated with decision-tree modeling. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between TOL surgery and XRT with respect to LC (odds ratio [OR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-1.3) and LFS (OR, 0.84, 95% CI, 0.42-1.66). The weighted mean difference for OS was 0.03. There were no objective differences for measures of voice quality. Decision-tree analysis was undertaken using mean 5-year local control initial probabilities. CO(2) laser cost $2475.65/case (US $2407.32/case), generating 1.663 QALYs, whereas radiation cost $4965.85/case (US $4828.79/case), generating 1.506 QALYs. This contrasts initial upstream costs for CO(2) laser (~$1889/case, ~US $1836.86/case) and radiation (~$2454.70/case, ~US $2386.95/case). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis shows that there is no clear difference in oncologic outcome between TOL surgery and XRT. There is a trend for improved post-treatment voice quality with XRT, although the clinical significance of this is questionable. TOL surgery dominates XRT from a cost-utility standpoint primarily because of the enhanced downstream affordability of salvage treatment.",2011-01-07272,21120828,Laryngoscope,Kevin M Higgins,2011,121 / 1,116-34,No,21120828,"Kevin M Higgins; What treatment for early-stage glottic carcinoma among adult patients: CO2 endolaryngeal laser excision versus standard fractionated external beam radiation is superior in terms of cost utility?, Laryngoscope, 2011-Jan; 121(1):0023-852X; 116-34",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Transoral CO2 Endolaryngeal laser excision (TOL) vs. Standard fractionated external beam radiation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,-15420.38,United States,2009,-18602.69

METHODS: We use a published simulation model of HIV case detection and treatment to examine 3 HIV screening scenarios, in addition to current practice as follows: (1) one-time; (2) every 5 years; and (3) annually. South African model input data include the following: 16.9% HIV prevalence, 1.3% annual incidence, 49% test acceptance rate, HIV testing costs of $6.49/patient, and a 47% linkage-to-care rate (including 2 sequential antiretroviral therapy regimens) for identified cases.

7773,Cost-effectiveness of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for Grade I degenerative spondylolisthesis,"Object Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for spondylolisthesis-associated back and leg pain is associated with improvement in pain, disability, and quality of life. However, given the rising health care costs associated with spinal fusion procedures and varying results of recent cost-utility studies, the cost-effectiveness of TLIF remains unclear. The authors set out to assess the comprehensive costs of TLIF at their institution and to determine its cost-effectiveness in the treatment of degenerative spondylolisthesis. Methods Forty-five patients undergoing TLIF for Grade I degenerative spondylolisthesis-associated back and leg pain after 6-12 months of conservative therapy were included. The authors assessed the 2-year back pain visual analog scale (VAS) score, leg pain VAS score, Oswestry Disability Index, and total back-related medical resource utilization, missed work, and health-state values (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], calculated from EQ-5D with US valuation). Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs based on Medicare national allowable payment amounts (direct cost), and patient and caregiver workday losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect cost). The mean total 2-year cost per QALY gained after TLIF was assessed. Results Compared with preoperative health states reported after at least 6 months of medical management, a significant improvement in back pain VAS score, leg pain VAS score, and Oswestry Disability Index was observed 2 years after TLIF, with a mean 2-year gain of 0.86 QALYs. The mean ± SD total 2-year cost of TLIF was $36,836 ± $11,800 (surgery cost, $21,311 ± $2800; outpatient resource utilization cost, $3940 ± $2720; indirect cost, $11,584 ± $11,363). Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion was associated with a mean 2-year cost per QALY gained of $42,854. Conclusions Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion improved pain, disability, and quality of life in patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis-associated back and leg pain.

7774,Quality of life and cost-utility assessment after strabismus surgery in adults,"PURPOSE: To understand the functional and psychosocial aspects of strabismus surgery, an evaluation based on the patient's perspective is essential. In this study, we assessed quality of life and utility in adult patients who had undergone strabismus surgery, and we modeled the cost of providing this intervention in order to calculate the cost-utility of strabismus surgery in adults. METHODS: The study population comprised 226 patients with strabismus aged 18 years or older who were scheduled for ocular alignment surgery at 12 facilities of the Strabismus Surgery Study Group in Japan. Survey questionnaires consisting of the Japanese versions of the Visual Function Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25) and 8-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-8) and utility assessment by a time trade-off method were administrated preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. On the basis of the cost model and measured utility data, the gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and $/QALY were estimated. RESULTS: Postoperatively, the subscale scores of the VFQ-25 and the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-8 showed a statistically significant improvement. A significant improvement of utility was also noted: 0.82 ± 0.28 postoperatively versus 0.76 ± 0.31 preoperatively. On the basis of the life expectancy of these patients and the cost model, the surgery resulted in a mean value gain of 0.99 QALYs and a cost-utility for strabismus surgery of 1,303 $/QALY.

7777,"Hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, and levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system (Mirena) for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding: cost effectiveness analysis","Objective: To undertake a cost effectiveness analysis comparing first and second generation endometrial ablative techniques, hysterectomy, and the levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system (Mirena) for treating heavy menstrual bleeding. Design: Model based economic evaluation with data from an individual patient data meta-analysis supplemented with cost and outcome data from published sources taking an NHS (National Health Service) perspective. A state transition (Markov) model was developed, the structure being informed by the reviews of the trials and clinical input. A subgroup analysis, one way sensitivity analysis, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also carried out. Population: Four hypothetical cohorts of women with heavy menstrual bleeding. Interventions: One of four alternative strategies: Mirena, first or second generation endometrial ablation techniques, or hysterectomy. Main outcome measures: Cost effectiveness based on incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Results: Hysterectomy is the preferred strategy for the first intervention for heavy menstrual bleeding. Although hysterectomy is more expensive, it produces more QALYs relative to other remaining strategies and is likely to be considered cost effective.

7782,Clinical efficacy and cost per quality-adjusted life years of pararenal endovascular aortic aneurysm repair compared with open surgical repair,"Abstract Purpose: To gauge the efficacy of applying commercially-available endografts to pararenal endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair compared with open surgical repair (OSR). Methods: From 2001 to 2009, 1868 AAA patients were referred to our service for evaluation; of these, 118 patients had pararenal AAAs. Sixty-six patients (51 men; mean age 70.8±7.6 years) had OSR and 52 (44 men; mean age 74.3±7.2 years) underwent pararenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The pararenal EVAR patients were older (74.3 versus 70.8 years, p?=?0.014), with higher mean comorbidity severity scores (p?=?0.0001). Mean aneurysm diameter was larger in the OSR patients (6.6 versus 5.9 cm, p?=?0.01). Primary endpoints were aneurysm-related survival and cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Secondary endpoints included 3-year freedom from major adverse clinical events, all-cause mortality, and secondary intervention. Results: There was no perioperative mortality in the pararenal EVAR group versus 3 (4.5%) deaths among the OSR patients (p?=?0.122). The 15% 30-day morbidity with pararenal EVAR was half that of OSR (p?=?0.059). Mean follow-up was 28.8 ±21.6 months for pararenal EVAR and 35.7±23.2 months for OSR. There were no aneurysm ruptures in either group and no conversions to open repair in the pararenal EVAR group. Three-year aneurysm-related survival was significantly higher with pararenal EVAR (100%) versus OSR (92.4%, p?=?0.045), but the freedom from any-cause death was lower with pararenal EVAR (57.1%) than OSR (84.8%, p?=?0.195). Three-year freedom from secondary intervention (pararenal EVAR 83.4% versus OSR 95.5%, p?=?0.301) and all-cause survival (pararenal EVAR 57.1% versus OSR 84.8%, p?=?0.195) were similar. Over a 3-year period, pararenal EVAR costs (including follow-up and reintervention) averaged €20,375 per patient to give a QALY value of 0.90, while mean costs for OSR were €23,928 per patient (0.86 QALY). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for pararenal EVAR was €129,586 saved per QALY gained. Conclusion: Pararenal EVAR afforded patients longer quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity and superior freedom from major adverse events up to 3 years. Although the relatively low 3-year survival rate reflected the greater comorbidity of the EVAR patients, pararenal EVAR was cost-effective.",2011-01-07302,21521058,J Endovasc Ther,Sherif Sultan,2011,18 / 2,181-96,No,21521058,"Sherif Sultan; Niamh Hynes; Clinical efficacy and cost per quality-adjusted life years of pararenal endovascular aortic aneurysm repair compared with open surgical repair, J Endovasc Ther, 2011-Apr; 18(2):1526-6028; 181-96",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pararenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) vs. Open surgical repair (OSR),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-88825,Euro,2009,-149326.69
7783,Increasing heart-health lifestyles in deprived communities: economic evaluation of lay health trainers,"Rationale, aims and objectives Cardiovascular disease (CVD) often arises from modifiable lifestyle factors. Health care professionals may lack the skills and resources to sustain behaviour change, lay 'health trainers' (LHT) offer a potential alternative. We sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of using a LHT to improve heart-health lifestyles in deprived communities. Methods Participants in this randomized trial were aged =18 years with at least one risk factor for CVD (hypertension, raised cholesterol, diabetes, BMI>30 or current smoker). Both groups received health promotion literature. LHT were also able to provide intervention participants with information, advice and support aimed at changing beliefs and behaviour. Costs and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) changes were estimated over 6 months. The cost-utility [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)] of LHT was calculated and assessed in relation to the cost-effectiveness threshold of £20 000-30 000 per QALY. The probability of LHT being cost-effective was also calculated. Results Seventy-two participants were randomized to a LHT, with 38 controls. The mean cost of the LHT intervention was £151. On average, other health and social service costs fell by £21 for controls and £75 for intervention participants giving a LHT mean overall incremental cost of £98. The mean QALY gains were 0.022 and 0.028, respectively. The ICER for LHT was £14 480, yet there was a 61% chance of making the wrong decision at a £20 000/QALY threshold. Conclusion LHT provision was estimated to be cost-effective for people at risk of CVD. However, a large level of uncertainty was associated with that decision.",2011-01-07305,21518152,J Eval Clin Pract,Garry R Barton,2011,/,,No,21518152,"Garry R Barton; Mark Goodall; Peter Bower; Sue Woolf; Simon Capewell; Mark B Gabbay; Increasing heart-health lifestyles in deprived communities: economic evaluation of lay health trainers, J Eval Clin Pract, 2011-Apr-24; ():1356-1294",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Lay health trainers (LHT) providing information, advice and support to change beliefs and behavior vs. Health promotion literature including patient booklets and food diary",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,14480,United Kingdom,2009,25292.74
7784,Cost Effectiveness of Warfarin Versus Aspirin in Patients Older Than 75 Years With Atrial Fibrillation,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oral anticoagulants are effective at reducing stroke compared with aspirin in atrial fibrillation patients older than 75 years. Although the benefits of reduced stroke risk outweigh the risks of bleeding, the cost effectiveness of warfarin in this patient population has not yet been established. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized, controlled trial; 973 patients =75 years of age with atrial fibrillation were recruited from primary care and randomly assigned to either take warfarin or aspirin. Follow-up was for a mean of 2.7 years. Costs of thrombotic and hemorrhagic events, anticoagulation clinic visits, and primary care utilization were determined. Clinical benefits were expressed in terms of a primary event avoided: fatal/nonfatal disabling stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, or systemic embolism. A cost-utility analysis was performed using quality-adjusted life years as the benefit measure. RESULTS: Total costs over 4 years were lower in the warfarin group (difference, -£165; 95% CI, -£452-£89), primarily driven by the difference in primary event costs. The primary event rate over 4 years was lower in the warfarin group (0.049 versus 0.099), and the quality-adjusted life years score was higher (difference, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.07-0.11). With lower costs and a higher quality-adjusted life years score, warfarin is the dominant treatment, but the differences in both costs and effects are small. CONCLUSIONS: Warfarin is cost-effective compared with aspirin in atrial fibrillation patients age =75 years. These data support the anticoagulant therapy option in this high-risk patient population. However, the small differences in costs and effects indicate the importance of exploring patient preferences.",2011-01-07308,21512184,Stroke,Sue Jowett,2011,/,,No,21512184,"Sue Jowett; Stirling Bryan; Jonathan Mant; Kate Fletcher; Andrea Roalfe; David Fitzmaurice; Gregory Y H Lip; F D Richard Hobbs; Cost Effectiveness of Warfarin Versus Aspirin in Patients Older Than 75 Years With Atrial Fibrillation, Stroke, 2011-Apr-21; ():1524-4628",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Warfarin vs. Aspirin 75 mg/day,Not Stated,Not Stated,75 Years,"Female, Male",Full,4 Years,3.50,3.50,-8300,United Kingdom,2007,-20741.37
7785,Implications of Attendance Patterns in Northern Ireland for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence supports the introduction of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening programme. The aims of this study were to estimate future disease patterns and to determine the effect of the proportion attending on the programme's cost-effectiveness. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results of the local AAA screening programme were reviewed. Ultrasonic infrarenal aortic diameter of 30 mm was considered aneurysmal. Projected population numbers from the Department of Health and current disease prevalence were used to estimate future number of potential patients. The Multi-centre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS) Markov model was used to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and 95% uncertainty intervals (UI), using a 30-year time horizon and 3.5% per annum discount, to determine the effect of attendance. RESULTS: Men were recruited from August 2004 to May 2010. 13316 were invited for a scan and 5931 (44.5%) attended. 321 AAA were diagnosed, giving a prevalence of 5.4%, while 27 large AAA (0.46%) were repaired. The annual incidence of AAA until 2021 will range from 441 to 526, with an incidence of 40-48 large AAA, with both showing a gradual increase with time. Using this attendance rate, the ICER was calculated at £2350 per life-year gained (95% UI: £1620-£4290), or £3020 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (95% UI: £2080-£5500). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of disease in this local AAA screening was similar to other studies. The low attendance will result in many AAA being missed, but will not impact greatly on the long-term cost-effectiveness.",2011-01-07309,21511501,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,S A Badger,2011,/,,No,21511501,"S A Badger; C Jones; A Murray; L L Lau; I S Young; Implications of Attendance Patterns in Northern Ireland for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening, Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg, 2011-Apr-19; ():1078-5884",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,National screening programme including invitation to participate in abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening program along with information on the condition vs. Standard care,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,3020,United Kingdom,2009,5275.14
7786,The cost-effectiveness of a modestly effective HIV vaccine in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The recent RV144 clinical trial showed that an ALVAC/AIDSVAX prime-boost HIV vaccine regimen may confer partial immunity in recipients and reduce transmission by 31%. Trial data suggest that efficacy may initially exceed 70% but decline over the following 3.5 years. Estimating the potential health benefits associated with a one-time vaccination campaign, as well as the projected benefits of repeat booster vaccination, may inform future HIV vaccine research and licensing decisions. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model to project the future course of the HIV epidemic in the United States under varying HIV vaccine scenarios. The model accounts for disease progression, infection transmission, antiretroviral therapy, and HIV-related morbidity and mortality. We projected HIV prevalence and incidence over time in multiple risk groups, and we estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs over a 10-year time horizon. We used an exponentially declining efficacy curve fit to trial data, and we assumed subsequent vaccine boosters confer similar immunity. Variations in vaccine parameters were examined in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Under existing HIV prevention and treatment efforts, an estimated 590,000 HIV infections occur over 10 years. One-time vaccination achieving 60% coverage of adults could prevent 9.8% of projected new infections over 10 years (and prevent 34% of new infections in the first year) and cost approximately $91,000/QALY gained relative to the status quo, assuming a vaccination price of $500. Targeted vaccination of high-risk groups results in net cost savings for vaccines costing less than $750. One-time vaccination of 60% of all adults coupled with three-year boosters only for men who have sex with men and injection drug users could prevent 21% of infections for $81,000/QALY gained relative to vaccination of high-risk groups only. A program attaining 90% vaccination coverage prevents 15% of new HIV cases over 10 years (and approximately50% of infections in the first year). CONCLUSIONS: A partially effective HIV vaccine with effectiveness similar to that observed in the RV144 trial would provide large health benefits in the United States and could meet conventionally accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds.

Variations in vaccine parameters were examined in sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Under existing HIV prevention and treatment efforts, an estimated 590,000 HIV infections occur over 10 years. One-time vaccination achieving 60% coverage of adults could prevent 9.8% of projected new infections over 10 years (and prevent 34% of new infections in the first year) and cost approximately $91,000/QALY gained relative to the status quo, assuming a vaccination price of $500. Targeted vaccination of high-risk groups results in net cost savings for vaccines costing less than $750. One-time vaccination of 60% of all adults coupled with three-year boosters only for men who have sex with men and injection drug users could prevent 21% of infections for $81,000/QALY gained relative to vaccination of high-risk groups only. A program attaining 90% vaccination coverage prevents 15% of new HIV cases over 10 years (and approximately50% of infections in the first year).

7793,Economic evaluation of a randomized controlled trial of ultrasound therapy for hard-to-heal venous leg ulcers,"BACKGROUND: A pragmatic, multicentre randomized controlled trial (VenUS III) was conducted to determine whether low-dose ultrasound therapy increased the healing rate of hard-to-heal leg ulcers. This study was a cost-effectiveness analysis of the trial data. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were conducted alongside the VenUS III trial, in which patients were randomly allocated to either ultrasound treatment administered weekly for 12 weeks along with standard care, or standard care alone. The time horizon was 12 months and based on the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that ultrasound therapy added to standard care was likely to be more costly and provide no extra benefit over standard care alone. Individuals who received ultrasound treatment plus standard care took a mean of 14·7 (95 per cent confidence interval - 32·7 to 56·8) days longer to heal, had 0·009 (-0·042 to 0·024) fewer quality-adjusted life years and had higher treatment costs by £197·88 (-35·19 to 420·32). Based on these point estimates, ultrasound therapy plus standard care for leg ulcers was dominated by standard care alone. The analysis of uncertainty showed that this treatment strategy is unlikely to be cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound treatment was not cost-effective for hard-to-heal leg ulcers and should not be recommended for adoption in the NHS.

7797,A Canadian economic analysis of U.S. Oncology Adjuvant Trial 9735,"Objectives: Recent results of the U.S. Oncology Adjuvant Trial 9735 demonstrated significant disease-free survival and overall survival benefits for docetaxel and cyclophosphamide (tc) compared with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (ac) in the adjuvant treatment of operable invasive breast cancer. Based on clinical data from the 9735 study, we evaluated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of tc compared with ac from the perspective of the Canadian publicly funded health care system. Methods: A Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained and per life-year gained. Monthly survival and risk of disease recurrence up to 7 years were obtained directly from the overall survival and disease-free survival curves in the 9735 study; life-years beyond 7 years were estimated using the average life expectancy of age-matched women in the general Canadian population. Canadian-specific resource utilization and unit costs (in 2008 Canadian dollars) were applied to estimate costs for chemotherapy administration, chemotherapy-related toxicities, recurrence, and adverse events. Health-utility scores and decrements used in the calculation of quality-adjusted life-years were derived from the literature. Results: The lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $8,251 for tc compared with ac, and the cost per life-year gained was $6,842. The results were robust across a range of sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Cost-effectiveness, combined with efficacy and an acceptable safety profile, support the adoption of tc as an alternative to ac in Canadian clinical practice for the adjuvant treatment of operable early breast cancer.",2011-01-07316,21505597,Curr Oncol,L M Bernard,2011,18 / 2,67-75,No,21505597,"L M Bernard; S Verma; M F Thompson; B C F Chan; N Mittmann; L Asma; S E Jones; A Canadian economic analysis of U.S. Oncology Adjuvant Trial 9735, Curr Oncol, 2011-Apr; 18(2):1198-0052; 67-75",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Docetaxel 75 mg/sq. m and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/sq. m (TC) vs. Doxorubicin 60 mg/sq. m and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/sq. m (AC),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,8251,Canada,2008,9364.5

7800,Economic evaluation of monitoring virologic responses to antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children in resource-limited settings,"OBJECTIVE: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) management for HIV-infected children is critical in many resource-constrained countries. We investigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of different frequencies of monitoring plasma viral load among HIV-positive children initiating ART in a resource-limited setting. DESIGN/METHODS: A stochastic agent-based simulation model was built and directly informed by a cohort of 304 HIV-infected children starting ART in Thailand between 2001 and 2009. The model simulated the expected costs and clinical outcomes over time according to different viral load monitoring frequencies and initiation of second-line therapies where appropriate. RESULTS: The optimal frequency of viral load monitoring was found to be annual, after a single screening at 6 months. Associated costs of viral load monitoring and appropriate ART would approximately triple current treatment costs. Compared with current conditions, a single screening during the first year of ART led to a 58.4% reduction in the total person-years of virological failure with annual monitoring leading to a 76.6% reduction. The incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained from the optimal monitoring frequency was estimated as US$68,084 when including costs of ART and US$7224 without ART costs. The estimated cost attributed to preventing one year of virological failure was US$3,393 with ART costs and US$359 without ART costs. CONCLUSIONS: Even infrequent viral load monitoring is likely to provide substantial clinical benefit to HIV-infected children on ART. Viral load monitoring can be considered cost-effective in many resource-limited settings.
