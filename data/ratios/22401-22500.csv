22401,Exploring the Cost-Effectiveness of Mechanical Thrombectomy Beyond 6 Hours Following Advanced Imaging in the United Kingdom,"Background and Purpose- In the United Kingdom, mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke patients assessed beyond 6 hours from symptom onset will be commissioned up to 12 hours provided that advanced imaging (AdvImg) demonstrates salvageable brain tissue. While the accuracy of AdvImg differs across technologies, evidence is limited regarding the proportion of patients who would benefit from late MT. We compared the cost-effectiveness of 2 care pathways: (1) MT within and beyond 6 hours based on AdvImg selection versus (2) MT only within 6 hours based on conventional imaging selection. The impact of varying AdvImg accuracy and prior probability for acute ischemic stroke patients to benefit from late MT was assessed. Methods- A decision tree and a Markov trace were developed. A hypothetical United Kingdom cohort of suspected stroke patients aged 71 years with first event was modeled. Costs, health outcomes, and probabilities were obtained from the literature. Outcomes included costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Various scenarios with prior probabilities of 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively, for acute ischemic stroke patients to benefit from late MT, and with perfect accuracy, 80% sensitivity, and 70% specificity of AdvImg were studied. Results- Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios resulting from our deterministic analyses varied from $8199 ( pound6164) to $49 515 ( pound37 229) per QALY gained. AdvImg accuracy impacted the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio only when its specificity decreased. Over lifetime horizons, all scenarios including late MT improved QALYs and LYs. Depending on the scenario, the probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed probabilities varying between 46% and 93% for the late MT pathway to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of $39 900 ( pound30 000) per QALY. Conclusions- Late MT based on AdvImg selection may be good value for money. However, additional data regarding the implementation of AdvImg and prior probability to benefit from late MT are needed before its cost-effectiveness can be fully assessed.",2019-01-31625,31637975,Stroke,Anne-Claire Peultier,2019,50 / 11,3220-3227,No,31637975,"Anne-Claire Peultier; Helen Rodgers; Denise Howel; Nawaraj Bhattarai; Robin Cant; Avril Drummond; Gary A Ford; Anne Forster; Richard Francis; Katie Hills; Anne-Marie Laverty; Christopher McKevitt; Peter McMeekin; Christopher I M Price; Elaine Stamp; Eleanor Stevens; Luke Vale; Lisa Shaw; Exploring the Cost-Effectiveness of Mechanical Thrombectomy Beyond 6 Hours Following Advanced Imaging in the United Kingdom, Stroke, 2019 Nov; 50(11):1524-4628; 3220-3227",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Medical Procedure","advanced imaging with early and late mechanical thrombectomy vs. Standard/Usual Care- ccemt, computed tomography angiography with early mechanical thrombectomy mt",Not Stated,71 Years,71 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"3 Years, Lifetime",3.50,3.50,8199,United States,2018,8450.55

22417,Evaluation of an Extended Stroke Rehabilitation Service (EXTRAS): A Randomized Controlled Trial and Economic Analysis,"Background and Purpose- There is limited evidence to guide rehabilitation to meet the longer term needs of stroke survivors. The clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an extended stroke rehabilitation service (EXTRAS) provided following early supported discharge were determined. Methods- EXTRAS was a pragmatic parallel-group observer-blind randomized controlled trial involving 19 UK centers. Patients with stroke were individually randomized to receive EXTRAS or usual care at discharge from early supported discharge. Five EXTRAS reviews were provided by an early supported discharge team member between one and 18 months, usually by telephone. Reviews consisted of a semi-structured interview assessing progress, rehabilitation needs, and service provision, with goal setting and action planning. The primary outcome was performance in extended activities of daily living (Nottingham EADL Scale) at 24 months post-randomization. The Nottingham EADL Scale is scored 0 to 66, with higher scores indicating better performance in these activities. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using resource utilization costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years. Analyses were intention to treat. Results- Between January 9, 2013 and October 26, 2015, 573 participants were randomized (EXTRAS, n=285; usual care, n=288). Mean 24 month Nottingham EADL Scale scores were EXTRAS (n=219) 40.0 (SD 18.1) and usual care (n=231) 37.2 (SD 18.5) giving an adjusted mean difference of 1.8 (95% CI, -0.7 to 4.2). 1155/1338 (86%) of expected EXTRAS reviews were undertaken. Over 24 months, the mean cost of resource utilization was lower in the intervention group: - pound311 (-$450 [95% CI, - pound3292 to pound2787; -$4764 to $4033]). EXTRAS provided more Quality Adjusted Life Years (0.07 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.12]). At current conventional thresholds of willingness to pay ( pound20 000 [$28 940] per Quality Adjusted Life Years), there was a 90% chance that EXTRAS could be considered cost-effective. Conclusions- EXTRAS did not significantly improve stroke survivors'' performance in extended activities of daily living. However, given the impact on costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years, EXTRAS may be an affordable addition to improve stroke care. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: www.isrctn.com.

22418,"Detachable low dead space syringes for the prevention of hepatitis C among people who inject drugs in Bristol, UK: an economic evaluation","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Traditional detachable syringes used by people who inject drugs (PWID) retain larger volumes of blood when the plunger is depressed than syringes with fixed needles-referred to as high (HDSS) and low dead space syringes (LDSS), respectively. Evidence suggests that using HDSS may result in greater hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission risk than LDSS. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of an intervention to introduce detachable LDSS in a needle and syringe programme (NSP). DESIGN: HCV transmission and disease progression model with cost-effectiveness analysis using a health-care perspective. Detachable LDSS are associated with increased costs ( pound0.008) per syringe, yearly staff training costs ( pound536) and an estimated decreased risk (by 47.5%) of HCV transmission compared with HDSS. The intervention was modelled for 10 years, with costs and health benefits (quality-adjusted life-years: QALYs) tracked over 50 years. SETTING: Bristol, UK. PARTICIPANTS AND CASES: PWID attending NSP. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Gradual replacement of HDSS at NSP, with 8, 58 and 95% of HDSS being replaced by detachable LDSS in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Comparator was continuing use of HDSS. MEASUREMENTS: Net monetary benefit. Benefits were measured in QALYs. FINDINGS: Introducing detachable LDSS was associated with a small increase in intervention costs ( pound21 717) compared with not introducing detachable LDSS, but considerable savings in HCV-related treatment and care costs ( pound4 138 118). Overall cost savings were pound4 116 401 over 50 years and QALY gains were 1000, with an estimated 30% reduction in new infections over the 10-year intervention period. In all sensitivity analyses, detachable LDSS resulted in cost savings and additional QALYs. Threshold analyses suggested that detachable LDSS would need to reduce HCV transmission risk of HDSS by 0.26% to be cost-saving and 0.04% to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Replacing high dead space syringes with detachable low dead space syringes in needle and syringe programmes in the United Kingdom is likely to be a cost-saving approach for reducing hepatitis C virus transmission.",2019-01-31632,31633849,Addiction,Elizabeth Hancock,2019,/,,No,31633849,"Elizabeth Hancock; Ian M Kronish; Nathalie Moise; Ying Kuen Cheung; Gregory N Clarke; Rowena J Dolor; Joan Duer-Hefele; Karen L Margolis; Tara St Onge; Faith Parsons; Jessica Retuerto; Anusorn Thanataveerat; Karina W Davidson; Detachable low dead space syringes for the prevention of hepatitis C among people who inject drugs in Bristol, UK: an economic evaluation, Addiction, 2019 Apr 29; ():0965-2140",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Medical Device,use of low dead space syringes vs. Standard/Usual Care- high dead space syringes,inject drugs attending a needle and syringe program,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,3.50,3.50,-4112.29,United Kingdom,2017,-5596.93
22419,Cost-effectiveness of Molecular Profile Patient Selection for First-line Treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer,"PURPOSE: Patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer are offered platinum-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab; however, this strategy is not cost-effective. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical predictive molecular test to identify and treat only patients potentially responsive to cetuximab (C) added to platinum-fluorouracil (PF) (PF + C POS) versus the administration of PF + C to all patients (PF + C ALL). METHODS: A Markov model has been developed to estimate health outcomes (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]; life years [LYs]) and costs of the 2 strategies on a time horizon of 3 years from the Italian health care perspective. For the response to treatment, a definition, including partial or complete response, has been applied. In the base-case scenario, molecular test sensitivity, specificity, and cost have been assumed equal to 85%, 70%, and euro4000, respectively. FINDINGS: The model estimated 0.5285 QALYs (0.9245 LYs) and 0.5666 QALYs (0.9949 LYs) for PF + C POS and PF + C ALL, respectively. The incremental cost-utility ratio of PF + C ALL versus PF + C POS was euro112,462/QALY, suggesting the administration of PF + C only to patients who would be responsive to it. IMPLICATIONS: The use of cetuximab with chemotherapy could be a cost-effective choice in first-line recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer if based on a molecular selection able to identify which patients will achieve partial or complete response to the treatment. The developed model may be usefully applied to new emerging treatments, such as immunotherapeutic agents in the same setting.",2019-01-31640,31630814,Clin Ther,Carla Rognoni,2019,41 / 12,2517-2528.e28,Yes,31630814,"Carla Rognoni; Nadia Pillai; Judith E Lupatsch; Mark Dusheiko; Matthias Schwenkglenks; Michel Maillard; C Simone Sutherland; Valerie E H Pittet; Swiss IBD Cohort study group; Cost-effectiveness of Molecular Profile Patient Selection for First-line Treatment of Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer, Clin Ther, 2019 Dec; 41(12):1879-114X; 2517-2528.e28",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Pharmaceutical","molecular test with 85% sensitivity, 75% specificity to identify responsive patients vs. Standard/Usual Care- platinum-fluorouracil + cetuximab",Recurrent and/or metastatic cancer,56 Years,56 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.50,3.50,112462,Euro,2017,134186.19
22420,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of early compared to late or no biologic treatment to manage Crohn's disease using real world data,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of early (</=2 years after diagnosis) compared to late or no biologic initiation (starting biologics >2 years after diagnosis or no biologic use) for adults with Crohn''s disease in Switzerland. METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model over the patient''s lifetime from the health system and societal perspectives. Transition probabilities, quality of life, and costs were estimated using real world data. Propensity score matching was used to ensure comparability between patients in the early (intervention) and late/no (comparator) biologic initiation strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained is reported in Swiss francs (CHF). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed. RESULTS: Total costs and QALYs were higher for the intervention (CHF384,607; 16.84 QALYs) compared to comparator (CHF340,800; 16.75 QALYs) strategy, resulting in high ICERs (health system: CHF887,450 per QALY; societal: CHF449,130 per QALY). Assuming a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY, in probabilistic sensitivity analysis the intervention strategy had a 0.1 and 0.25 probability of being cost-effective from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively.

22421,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of early compared to late or no biologic treatment to manage Crohn's disease using real world data,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of early (</=2 years after diagnosis) compared to late or no biologic initiation (starting biologics >2 years after diagnosis or no biologic use) for adults with Crohn''s disease in Switzerland. METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model over the patient''s lifetime from the health system and societal perspectives. Transition probabilities, quality of life, and costs were estimated using real world data. Propensity score matching was used to ensure comparability between patients in the early (intervention) and late/no (comparator) biologic initiation strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained is reported in Swiss francs (CHF). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed. RESULTS: Total costs and QALYs were higher for the intervention (CHF384,607; 16.84 QALYs) compared to comparator (CHF340,800; 16.75 QALYs) strategy, resulting in high ICERs (health system: CHF887,450 per QALY; societal: CHF449,130 per QALY). Assuming a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY, in probabilistic sensitivity analysis the intervention strategy had a 0.1 and 0.25 probability of being cost-effective from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. In addition, ICERs improved when we assumed a 30% reduction in biologic prices (health system: CHF134,502 per QALY; societal: intervention dominant). CONCLUSIONS: Early biologic use was not cost-effective considering a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY compared to late/no biologic use.

22422,Impact of maternal obesity on fetal cardiac screening: which follow-up strategy is cost-effective?,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of incomplete fetal cardiac screening with different follow-up strategies for non-obese and obese women. METHODS: Three decision-analytic models-one each for non-obese, obese, and Class III obese women-were developed to compare follow-up (f/u) strategies for initial suboptimal fetal cardiac screening. Five strategies studied were: (a) no f/u ultrasound (US) but direct to fetal echocardiography (FE), (b) 1 f/u US and then FE if cardiac views were still suboptimal, (c) up to 2 f/u US and then FE if cardiac views were still suboptimal, (d) 1 f/u US and no FE, and (e) up to 2 f/u US and no FE. The models identified fetuses with major CHD in a theoretical cohort of 4,000,000 births. Outcomes related to neonatal mortality and neuro-developmental disability were calculated. A cost-effectiveness threshold was set at $100,000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Base case, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation were performed. RESULTS: In our base-case models for all BMI groups, no f/u US and direct referral to FE led to the best outcomes, detecting 7%, 25%, and 82% more CHD for non-obese, obese, and Class III obese respectively, compared to the baseline strategy, 1 f/u US and no FE. However, no f/u US and direct referral to FE was over the $100,000/QALY threshold and therefore not cost-effective. The cost-effective strategy for all BMI groups was up to 1 f/u US and no FE. Both 2 f/u US and no FE and 2 f/u and FE were dominated (more costly and less effective), while 1 f/u and FE was over the cost-effectiveness threshold. 1 f/u US and no FE was the optimal strategy in 97%, 93%, and 86% of trials in Monte Carlo for the non-obese, obese, and Class III obese models respectively. CONCLUSION: For both non-obese and obese women, the optimal CHD screening strategy is no further US and immediate referral to FE; however, this strategy is not cost-effective. Considering costs, 1 f/u US and no FE is the preferred strategy. For both obese and non-obese women, Monte Carlo simulations were very clear that 1 f/u US and no FE was the optimal strategy. Both non-obese and obese women should be offered up to 1 f/u ultrasounds if fetal cardiac screening is not completed. This article is protected by copyright.

METHODS: Three decision-analytic models-one each for non-obese, obese, and Class III obese women-were developed to compare follow-up (f/u) strategies for initial suboptimal fetal cardiac screening. Five strategies studied were: (a) no f/u ultrasound (US) but direct to fetal echocardiography (FE), (b) 1 f/u US and then FE if cardiac views were still suboptimal, (c) up to 2 f/u US and then FE if cardiac views were still suboptimal, (d) 1 f/u US and no FE, and (e) up to 2 f/u US and no FE. The models identified fetuses with major CHD in a theoretical cohort of 4,000,000 births. Outcomes related to neonatal mortality and neuro-developmental disability were calculated. A cost-effectiveness threshold was set at $100,000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Base case, sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation were performed. RESULTS: In our base-case models for all BMI groups, no f/u US and direct referral to FE led to the best outcomes, detecting 7%, 25%, and 82% more CHD for non-obese, obese, and Class III obese respectively, compared to the baseline strategy, 1 f/u US and no FE. However, no f/u US and direct referral to FE was over the $100,000/QALY threshold and therefore not cost-effective. The cost-effective strategy for all BMI groups was up to 1 f/u US and no FE. Both 2 f/u US and no FE and 2 f/u and FE were dominated (more costly and less effective), while 1 f/u and FE was over the cost-effectiveness threshold. 1 f/u US and no FE was the optimal strategy in 97%, 93%, and 86% of trials in Monte Carlo for the non-obese, obese, and Class III obese models respectively. CONCLUSION: For both non-obese and obese women, the optimal CHD screening strategy is no further US and immediate referral to FE; however, this strategy is not cost-effective.

A Markov model was developed to compare the life-time cost and effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for untreated metastatic NSCLC, based on the clinical data derived from phase III randomized controlled trial (KEYNOTE-042, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02220894). Weibull distribution was fitted to simulate the parametric survival functions. Drug cost were collected from official websites and utility values were obtained from published literature. Total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed as primary output indicators. The impact of different PD-L1 expression levels on ICER were also evaluated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the model uncertainty. Compared with chemotherapy, patients treated with pembrolizumab provided an additional 1.13, 1.01 and 0.59 QALYs in patients with PD-L1 expression levels of >/=50%, >/=20%, and >/=1%, with corresponding incremental cost of $53,784, $47,479 and $39,827 respectively. The resultant ICERs of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy were $47,596, $47,184 and $68,061/QALY, in three expression levels of PD-L1, respectively, and all of which did not exceed the WTP threshold of 180,000 /QALY.

22439,Cost-utility analysis of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with different PD-L1 expression levels,"To evaluate the cost-utility of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy as the first-line setting for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the US health care system perspective. A Markov model was developed to compare the life-time cost and effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for untreated metastatic NSCLC, based on the clinical data derived from phase III randomized controlled trial (KEYNOTE-042, ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02220894). Weibull distribution was fitted to simulate the parametric survival functions. Drug cost were collected from official websites and utility values were obtained from published literature. Total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed as primary output indicators. The impact of different PD-L1 expression levels on ICER were also evaluated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the model uncertainty. Compared with chemotherapy, patients treated with pembrolizumab provided an additional 1.13, 1.01 and 0.59 QALYs in patients with PD-L1 expression levels of >/=50%, >/=20%, and >/=1%, with corresponding incremental cost of $53,784, $47,479 and $39,827 respectively. The resultant ICERs of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy were $47,596, $47,184 and $68,061/QALY, in three expression levels of PD-L1, respectively, and all of which did not exceed the WTP threshold of 180,000 /QALY. Probability sensitivity analysis outcome supported that pembrolizumab exhibited evident advantage over chemotherapy to be cost-effective. One-way sensitivity analysis found that ICERs were most sensitive to utility value of pembrolizumab in progression survival state. All the adjustment of parameters did not qualitatively change the result. For treatment-naive, metastatic NSCLC patients with PD-L1 positive, pembrolizumab was estimated to be cost-effective compared with chemotherapy for all PD-L1 expression level at a WTP threshold of $180,000 /QALY in the context of the US health care system.",2019-01-31671,31610828,Oncol Res,Xiuhua Weng,2019,/,,No,31610828,"Xiuhua Weng; Robert R Muder; Petra Zimmermann; Kirsten P Perrett; Nicole Ritz; Katie L Flanagan; Roy Robins-Browne; Fiona R M van der Klis; Nigel Curtis; MIS BAIR group; Cost-utility analysis of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with different PD-L1 expression levels, Oncol Res, 2019 Oct 14; ():1555-3906",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,pembrolizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- Chemotherapy,metastatic non-small cell lung cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,0.00,68061,United States,2017,71862.5
22440,Health benefits and costs of weight-loss dietary counselling by nurses in primary care: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of brief weight-loss counselling by dietitian-trained practice nurses, in a high-income-country case study. DESIGN: A literature search of the impact of dietary counselling on BMI was performed to source the ''best'' effect size for use in modelling. This was combined with multiple other input parameters (e.g. epidemiological and cost parameters for obesity-related diseases, likely uptake of counselling) in an established multistate life-table model with fourteen parallel BMI-related disease life tables using a 3 % discount rate. SETTING: New Zealand (NZ). PARTICIPANTS: We calculated quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained and health-system costs over the remainder of the lifespan of the NZ population alive in 2011 (n 4.4 million). RESULTS: Counselling was estimated to result in an increase of 250 QALY (95 % uncertainty interval -70, 560 QALY) over the population''s lifetime. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 2011 $NZ 138 200 per QALY gained (2018 $US 102 700). Per capita QALY gains were higher for Maori (Indigenous population) than for non-Maori, but were still not cost-effective. If willingness-to-pay was set to the level of gross domestic product per capita per QALY gained (i.e. 2011 $NZ 45 000 or 2018 $US 33 400), the probability that the intervention would be cost-effective was 2 %.

22441,Cost-effectiveness of Osimertinib as a Second-line Treatment in Patients With EGFR-mutated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in China,"PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib used as a second-line treatment after failure of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China. METHODS: From the perspective of China''s health care system, a Markov model was used for estimating the costs and health outcomes of osimertinib and 4 platinum-based chemotherapies, including pemetrexed + platinum (PP), gemcitabine + platinum (GP), docetaxel + platinum (DP), and paclitaxel + platinum (TP). Two scenarios were considered, one in all confirmed patients with T790M-positive disease (scenario 1) and the other in all patients whose disease progressed after epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, which consisted of patients with T790M-positive or T790M-negative NSCLC (scenario 2). Clinical data for transition probabilities and treatment effects were obtained from published clinical trials. Health care resource utilization and costs were derived from local administrative databases and published literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the results. FINDINGS: In the base-case analysis, compared with the 4 platinum-based chemotherapies, osimertinib yielded an additional 0.671 to 0.846 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), with incremental costs of 15,943 to 20,299 USD in scenario 1, and an additional 0.376 to 0.808 QALY with incremental costs of 9710 to 15,407 USD in scenario 2. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probabilities that osimertinib would be cost-effective were 57.7% in scenario 1 and 58.4% in scenario 2 if the willingness-to-pay threshold were 30,000 USD/QALY, and probabilities would be more than 75 % in both scenarios if the willingness-to-pay threshold were 50,000 USD/QALY.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness (CE) of empagliflozin + SoC in comparison to sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC based on the respective CVOT. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes Model (CDM) was calibrated to reproduce the CVOT outcomes. EMPA-REG OUTCOME baseline characteristics and CVOT specific treatment effects on risk factors for cardiovascular disease [glycated haemogloblin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, lipids] were applied. Three-year observed cardiovascular events of empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC were derived from EMPA-REG OUTCOME and an indirect treatment comparison. Relative risk (RR) adjustments to calibrate the CDM were estimated after consecutive attempts of running the model until the observed and CDM-predicted outcomes matched closely. The drug-specific treatment effects were considered up until treatment switch (when HbA1c reached 8.5%), after which, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) 82 risk equations predicted events based on co-existing risk factors and treatment intensification to basal-bolus insulin were applied. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Costs and quality of life data were derived from UK national sources and published literature. A 50-year time horizon and discount rate of 3.5% were applied. RESULTS: The CDM projected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 6.408, 5.917 and 5.704 and total costs of 50,801 GBP, 47,627 GBP and 48,071 GBP for empagliflozin + SoC, sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC, respectively. The incremental CE ratio (ICER) of empagliflozin + SoC versus sitagliptin + SoC and saxagliptin + SoC was 6464 GBP/QALY and 3878 GBP/QALY, respectively.

22451,"Methadone, Buprenorphine, or Detoxification for Management of Perinatal Opioid Use Disorder: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis","OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether methadone, buprenorphine, or detoxification treatment is the most cost-effective approach to the management of opioid use disorder (OUD) during pregnancy. METHODS: We created a decision analytic model that compared the cost effectiveness (eg, the marginal cost of the strategy in U.S. dollars divided by the marginal effectiveness of the strategy, measured in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) of initiation of methadone, buprenorphine, or detoxification in treatment of OUD during pregnancy. Probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from the existing literature. Incremental cost-effective ratios for each strategy were calculated, and a ratio of $100,000 per QALY was used to define cost effectiveness. One-way sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: Under base assumptions, initiation of buprenorphine was more effective at a lower cost than either methadone or detoxification and thus was the dominant strategy. Buprenorphine was no longer cost effective if the cost of methadone was 8% less than the base-case estimate ($1,646/month) or if the overall costs of detoxification were 121% less than the base-case estimate for the detoxification cost multiplier, which was used to increase the values of both inpatient and outpatient management of detoxification by a factor of 2. Monte Carlo analyses revealed that buprenorphine was the cost-effective strategy in 70.5% of the simulations. Direct comparison of buprenorphine with methadone demonstrated that buprenorphine was below the incremental cost-effective ratio in 95.1% of simulations; direct comparison between buprenorphine and detoxification demonstrated that buprenorphine was below the incremental cost-effective ratio in 45% of simulations. CONCLUSION: Under most circumstances, we estimate that buprenorphine is the cost-effective strategy when compared with either methadone or detoxification as treatment for OUD during pregnancy.

Digital therapeutics (DTxs) delivering these interventions may provide benefits comparable to pharmacologic therapies, displacing medications for some patients. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the economic impact of a digital behavioral intervention in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension (HTN) and estimate the impact of clinical inertia on deprescribing medications. METHODS: Decision analytic models estimated health resource savings and cost effectiveness from a US commercial payer perspective. A 3-year time horizon was most relevant to the intervention and payer. Effectiveness of the DTx in improving clinical outcomes was based on cohort studies and published literature. Health resource utilization (HRU), health state utilities, and costs were drawn from the literature with costs adjusted to 2018 dollars. Future costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses assessed uncertainty. RESULTS: Average HRU savings ranged from $97 to $145 per patient per month, with higher potential benefits in T2DM. Cost-effectiveness acceptability analyses using a willingness-to-pay of $50,000/QALY indicated that the intervention would be cost effective at total 3-year program costs of $6468 and $6620 for T2DM and HTN, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed that reduced medication costs are a primary driver of potential HRU savings, and the results were robust within values tested. A resistance to deprescribe medications when a patient''s clinical outcomes improve can substantially reduce the estimated economic benefits.

22457,Should We Use Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) for the Characterization of Nonpalpable Testicular Lesions? An Analysis from a Cost-Effectiveness Perspective,"PURPOSE: Accurate characterization of testicular lesions is crucial to allow for correct treatment of malignant tumors and to avoid unnecessary procedures in benign ones. In recent years, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) proved to be superior in specifying the dignity of small, nonpalpable testicular lesions (< 1.5 cm) compared to native B-mode and color Doppler ultrasound which were previously regarded as the primary imaging method. However, the cost-effectiveness of CEUS has not been evaluated yet. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CEUS as compared to unenhanced ultrasound for the characterization of nonpalpable testicular lesions. METHODS: A decision model based on Markov simulations estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with unenhanced ultrasound and CEUS. Model input parameters were obtained from recent literature. Deterministic sensitivity analysis of diagnostic parameters and costs was performed. Also, probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo Modelling was applied. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) was set to $100 000/QALY. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, unenhanced ultrasound resulted in total costs of $5113.14 and an expected effectiveness of 8.29 QALYs, whereas CEUS resulted in total costs of $4397.77 with 8.35 QALYs. Therefore, the unenhanced ultrasound strategy was dominated by CEUS in the base-case scenario. Sensitivity analysis showed CEUS to be the cost-effective alternative along a broad range of costs.

22458,"Cost-Benefit Limitations of Extended, Outpatient Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis Following Surgery for Crohn's Disease","BACKGROUND: Patients with Crohn''s disease are at increased risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism. Historically, extended outpatient prophylaxis has not met conventional measures of societal cost-benefit advantage. However, extended prophylaxis for patients with Crohn''s disease may be more cost-effective because of the patients'' high thrombotic risk and long life expectancy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of extended prophylaxis in patients with Crohn''s disease after abdominal surgery. DESIGN: A decision tree model was used to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost per case averted with extended-duration venous thromboembolism prophylaxis following abdominal surgery. SETTING: The risk of a postdischarge thrombotic event, age at surgery, type of thrombotic event, prophylaxis risk reduction, bleeding complications, and mortality were estimated by using existing published sources. PATIENTS: Studied were patients with Crohn''s disease versus routine care. INTERVENTION: We constructed a decision analysis to compare costs and outcomes in patients with Crohn''s disease postoperatively with and without extended prophylaxis over a lifetime horizon. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Productivity costs ($) and benefits (quality-adjusted life-year) were used to reflect a societal perspective and were time discounted at 3%. Multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analysis accounted for uncertainty in probabilities, costs, and utility weights. RESULTS: With the use of reference parameters, the individual expected societal total cost of care was $399.83 without and $1387.95 with prophylaxis. Preventing a single mortality with prophylaxis would cost $43.00 million (number needed to treat: 39,839 individuals). The incremental cost was $1.90 million per quality-adjusted life-year. Adjusting across a range of scenarios upheld these conclusions 88% of the time. With further sensitivity testing, subpopulations with postdischarge thrombosis rates greater than 4.9% favors postoperative extended-duration venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. LIMITATIONS: Further investigation is needed to determine if specific high-risk individuals can be preemptively identified in the Crohn''s surgical population for targeted prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: Extended prophylaxis in patients with Crohn''s disease postoperatively is not cost-effective when the cumulative incidence of posthospital thrombosis remains less than 4.9%. These findings are driven by the low absolute risk of thrombosis in this population and the considerable cost of universal treatment. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A998.

Sin embargo, la profilaxis prolongada en los pacientes con Crohn puede ser mas rentable debido al alto riesgo trombotico y a una larga esperanza de vida en estos pacientes.Evaluar la rentabilidad de la profilaxis prolongada en pacientes postoperados de un Crohn.Se utilizo un modelo de arbol de decision para evaluar el incremento de rentabilidad y el costo por cada caso evitado con la profilaxis prolongada de tromboembolismo venoso despues de cirugia abdominal.Se calcularon utilizando fuentes publicadas el riesgo de evento trombotico posterior al alta, la edad del paciente al momento de la cirugia, el tipo de evento trombotico, la reduccion del riesgo de profilaxis, las complicaciones hemorragicas y la mortalidad.Se estudiaron los pacientes de atencion rutinaria versus aquellos portadores de Crohn.Construimos un arbol de analisis decisional para comparar costos y resultados de pacientes portadores de Crohn, con y sin profilaxis prolongada en el postoperatorio en un horizonte de por vida.Los costos de productividad ($) y los beneficios (ano de vida ajustado por calidad) se utilizaron para reflejar la perspectiva social y se descontaron en el tiempo de un 3%. El analisis de sensibilidad probabilistica multivariable dio cuenta de la incertidumbre en las probabilidades, costos y peso de utilidades.Usando parametros de referencia, el costo total social esperado de la atencion individual fue de $ 399.83 sin y $ 1,387.95 con profilaxis. La prevencion del deceso de un paciente con profilaxis costaria $ 43.00 millones (valor requerido para tratar: 39,839 individuos). El costo incrementado fue de $ 1.90 millones por ano de vida ajustado por la calidad. El ajuste a traves de una gama de escenarios confirmo estas conclusiones el 88% del tiempo. Con pruebas de sensibilidad adicionales, las subpoblaciones con tasas de trombosis posteriores al alta fueron superiores al 4,9% y favorecian la profilaxis prolongada del tromboembolismo venoso en el postoperatorio.Se necesita mas investigacion para determinar si se puede identificar de manera preventiva los individuos especificos de alto riesgo en la poblacion quirurgica de Crohn en casos de profilaxis dirigida.La profilaxis prolongada en pacientes postoperados de un Crohn no es rentable cuando la incidencia acumulada de trombosis posthospitalaria sigue siendo inferior al 4,9%. Estos hallazgos son impulsados por el bajo riesgo absoluto de trombosis en esta poblacion y el costo considerable del tratamiento universal.

22459,Clinical- and Cost-Effectiveness of a Mandibular Advancement Device Versus Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Moderate Obstructive Sleep Apnea,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Limited evidence exists on the cost-effectiveness of mandibular advancement device (MAD) compared to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in moderate obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Therefore, this study compares the clinical and cost-effectiveness of MAD therapy with CPAP therapy in moderate OSA. METHODS: In a multicentre randomized controlled trial, patients with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 15 to 30 events/h were randomized to either MAD or CPAP. Incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios (ICER/ICUR, in terms of AHI reduction and quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs, based on the EuroQol Five-Dimension Quality of Life questionnaire]) were calculated after 12 months, all from a societal perspective. RESULTS: In the 85 randomized patients (n = 42 CPAP, n = 43 MAD), AHI reduction was significantly greater with CPAP (median reduction AHI 18.3 [14.8-22.6] events/h) than with MAD therapy (median reduction AHI 13.5 [8.5-18.4] events/h) after 12 months. Societal costs after 12 months were higher for MAD than for CPAP (mean difference euro2.156). MAD was less cost-effective than CPAP after 12 months (ICER -euro305 [-euro3.003 to euro1.572] per AHI point improvement). However, in terms of QALY, MAD performed better than CPAP after 12 months (euro33.701 [-euro191.106 to euro562.271] per QALY gained). CONCLUSIONS: CPAP was more clinically effective (in terms of AHI reduction) and cost-effective than MAD. However, costs per QALY was better with MAD as compared to CPAP. Therefore, CPAP is the first-choice treatment option in moderate OSA and MAD may be a good alternative.

22460,Cost-Effectiveness of Noninvasive Screening for Alcohol-Related Liver Fibrosis,"Alcohol-related liver disease is often undetected until irreversible late-stage decompensated disease manifests. Consequently, there is an unmet need for effective and economically reasonable pathways to screen for advanced alcohol-related fibrosis. We used real-world data from a large biopsy-controlled study of excessive drinkers recruited from primary and secondary care, to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of four primary care initiated strategies: 1) routine liver function tests with follow-up ultrasonography for test-positives, 2) the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test, with hospital liver stiffness measurement (LSM) for positives, 3) three-tier strategy using Forns Index to control before strategy two, 4) direct referral of all to LSM. We used linked decision trees and Markov models to evaluate outcomes short-term (cost-per-accurate-diagnosis) and long-term (quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs). For low-prevalence populations, ELF with LSM follow-up was most cost-effective, both short-term (accuracy 96%, 196$ per patient), and long-term incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) $5,387-8,430/QALY, depending on whether diagnostic testing had lasting or temporary effects on abstinence rates. Adding Forns Index decreased costs to $72 per patient and accuracy to 95%. The strategy resulted in less QALY''s due to more false negatives, but an ICER of $3,012, making this strategy suited for areas with restricted access to ELF and TE, or lower willingness-to-pay. For high-prevalence populations, direct referral to LSM was highly cost-effective (accuracy 93%, $297 per patient), with ICERs between $490 and $1,037/QALY CONCLUSION: Non-invasive screening for advanced, alcohol-related fibrosis is a cost-effective intervention when different referral pathways are used according to the prevalence of advanced fibrosis.

22480,Optimizing Surveillance and Re-intervention Strategy Following Elective Endovascular Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms,"BACKGROUND: EVAR for abdominal aortic aneurysm has an initial survival advantage over OR, but more frequent complications increase costs and long-term aneurysm-related mortality. Randomized controlled trials of EVAR versus OR have shown EVAR is not cost-effective over a patient''s lifetime. However, in the EVAR-1 trial, postoperative surveillance may have been sub-optimal, as the importance of sac growth as a predictor of graft failure was overlooked. METHODS: Real-world data informed a discrete event simulation model of postoperative outcomes following EVAR. Outcomes observed EVAR-1 were compared with those from 5 alternative postoperative surveillance and re-intervention strategies. Key events, quality-adjusted life years and costs were predicted. The impact of using complication and rupture rates from more recent devices, imaging and re-intervention methods was also explored. RESULTS: Compared with observed EVAR-1 outcomes, modeling full adherence to the EVAR-1 scan protocol reduced abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) deaths by 3% and increased elective re-interventions by 44%. European Society re-intervention guidelines provided the most clinically effective strategy, with an 8% reduction in AAA deaths, but a 52% increase in elective re-interventions. The cheapest and most cost-effective strategy used lifetime annual ultrasound in primary care with confirmatory computed tomography if necessary, and reduced AAA-related deaths by 5%. Using contemporary rates for complications and rupture did not alter these conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: All alternative strategies improved clinical benefits compared with the EVAR-1 trial.

22481,Cost-Effectiveness of Pharmacomechanical Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis Versus Standard Anticoagulation in Patients With Proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis: Results From the ATTRACT Trial,"BACKGROUND: In patients with acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pharmacomechanical catheter-directed thrombolysis (PCDT) in conjunction with anticoagulation therapy is increasingly used with the goal of preventing postthrombotic syndrome. Long-term costs and cost-effectiveness of these 2 treatment strategies from the perspective of the US healthcare system have not been compared. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2014, the ATTRACT trial (Acute Venous Thrombosis: Thrombus Removal With Adjunctive Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis) randomized 692 patients with acute proximal DVT to PCDT plus anticoagulation (n=337) or standard treatment with anticoagulation alone (n=355). Costs (2017 US dollars) were assessed over a 24-month follow-up period using a combination of resource-based costing, hospital bills, Medicare reimbursement rates, and the Drug Topics Red Book. Health state utilities were obtained from the Short Form-36. In-trial results and US life tables were used to develop a Markov cohort model to evaluate lifetime cost-effectiveness. For the PCDT group, mean costs of the initial procedure were $13 600; per-patient costs associated with the index hospitalization were $21 509 for PCDT and $3877 for standard care (difference=$17 632; 95% CI, $16 117-$19 243). The 24-month difference in costs was $20 045 (95% CI, $16 093-$24 120). Utility scores increased significantly between baseline and 6 months for both groups, with no significant differences between groups at any follow-up time point. Projected differences in lifetime costs of $16 740 and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.08, yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCDT of $222 041/QALY gained. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability that PCDT would achieve a lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50 000/QALY or <$150 000/QALY was 1% and 25%, respectively. For iliofemoral DVT, QALY gains with PCDT were greater, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $137 526/QALY; for femoral-popliteal DVT, standard therapy was an economically dominant strategy. CONCLUSIONS: With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio >$200 000/QALY gained, PCDT is not an economically attractive treatment for proximal DVT. PCDT may be of intermediate value in patients with iliofemoral DVT. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

22482,A Cost-Utility Analysis of Endovascular Thrombectomy in a Real-World Setting,"OBJECTIVE: Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is efficacious for ischemic stroke caused by proximal intracranial large-vessel occlusion involving the anterior cerebral circulation. However, evidence of its cost-effectiveness, especially in a real-world setting, is limited. We assessed whether EVT +/- tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was cost-effective when compared with standard care +/- tPA at our center. METHOD: We identified patients treated with EVT +/- tPA after the Endovascular treatment for Small Core and Anterior circulation Proximal occlusion with Emphasis on minimizing computed tomography to recanalization times trial from our prospective stroke registry from February 1, 2013 to January 31, 2017. Patients admitted before February 2013 and treated with standard care +/- tPA constitute the controls. The sample size was 88. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using the net monetary benefit (NMB). Differences in average costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated using the augmented inverse probability weighted estimator. We accounted for sampling and methodological uncertainty in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Patients treated with EVT +/- tPA had a net gain of 2.89 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-4.99] QALYs at an additional cost of $22,200 (95% CI: -28,902-78,244) per patient compared with the standard care +/- tPA group. The NMB was $122,300 (95% CI: -4777-253,133) with a 0.85 probability of being cost-effective. The expected savings to the healthcare system would amount to $321,334 per year.

22483,Cost-Effectiveness of Therapist-Guided Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Stress-Related Disorders: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Stress-related disorders are associated with significant suffering, functional impairment, and high societal costs. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) is a promising treatment for stress-related disorders but has so far not been subjected to health economic evaluation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of ICBT for patients with stress-related disorders in the form of adjustment disorder (AD) or exhaustion disorder (ED). We hypothesized that ICBT, compared with a waitlist control (WLC) group, would generate improvements at low net costs, thereby making it cost-effective. METHODS: Health economic data were obtained in tandem with a randomized controlled trial of a 12-week ICBT in which patients (N=100) were randomized to an ICBT (n=50) or a WLC (n=50) group. Health outcomes and costs were surveyed pre- and posttreatment. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) based on remission rates and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) based on health-related quality of life. Bootstrap sampling was used to assess the uncertainty of our results. RESULTS: The ICER indicated that the most likely scenario was that ICBT led to higher remission rates compared with the WLC and was associated with slightly larger reductions in costs from pre- to posttreatment. ICBT had a 60% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness to pay (WTP) of US $0 and a 96% probability of being cost-effective at a WTP of US $1000. The ICUR indicated that ICBT also led to improvements in quality of life at no net societal cost. Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of our results. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that ICBT is a cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from AD or ED. Compared with no treatment, ICBT for these patients yields large effects at no or minimal societal net costs.

22485,Value of single-level circumferential fusion: a 10-year prospective outcomes and cost-effectiveness analysis comparing posterior facet versus pedicle screw fixation,"PURPOSE: To compare the clinical and economic outcomes of facet versus pedicle screw instrumentation for single-level circumferential lumbar spinal fusion. METHODS: Outcomes included self-assessment of back and leg pain, pain drawing, ODI, pain medication usage, and procedure success. The CEA was based on the 10-year data collected, and the base-case was from a US payer perspective. Costs included the index surgery, additional surgeries, outpatient/ED visits, and medications. To determine quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), ODI scores were used to predict SF-6D utilities. Sensitivity analyses were performed from a modified payer perspective including device costs and from a societal perspective including productivity loss. Discounted and undiscounted incremental costs and QALYs were calculated. Bootstrapping was performed to estimate the distribution of incremental costs and effects. RESULTS: Clinical improvement was significant from pre-op to 10-year follow-up for both groups (p < 0.01 for all outcomes scales). Outcomes were significantly better for back pain and ODI for the facet versus pedicle group at all follow-up periods > 1 year (p < 0.05). In the CEA base-case, facets had more QALYs (0.68) and lower costs (- $8650) per person compared with pedicle screws. Therefore, facets were dominant (i.e., provided cost savings and greater QALYs) compared with pedicle screws. Facets had a 97% probability of being below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000 per QALY gained and were estimated to be dominant over pedicle screws in 84% of the simulations.

22486,Sacubitril-valsartan versus enalapril for acute decompensated heart failure: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The Comparison of Sacubitril-Valsartan versus Enalapril on Effect on NT-proBNP in Patients Stabilised from an Acute Heart Failure Episode (PIONEER-HF) trial demonstrated significant reductions in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide. Our study explored the cost-effectiveness of the use of sacubitril-valsartan versus enalapril in acute decompensated heart failure from the Australian healthcare perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was designed using data from the PIONEER-HF trial to model the clinical progress and costs of patients over a lifetime time horizon. The model consisted of three health states: ''alive and event-free'', ''alive after non-fatal hospitalisation for acute decompensated heart failure'' or ''dead''. Costs and utilities were estimated from published sources. The cost of sacubitril-valsartan (per the Australian pharmaceutical benefits schedule) was AU$7.08/day. Outcomes of interest were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year gained and cost per year of life saved. Cost and benefits were discounted at 5.0% per annum. RESULTS: Compared to enalapril, sacubitril-valsartan was estimated to cost an additional AU$7464 (discounted) per person, but lead to 0.127 years of life saved (discounted) and 0.096 quality-adjusted life years gained (discounted) over a lifetime analysis. These equated to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of AU$58,629/year of life saved (US$41,795, EUeuro58,629, GBP pound32,001) and AU$77,889/quality-adjusted life year gained (US$55,526, EUeuro49,202, GBP pound42,504). We have assumed a threshold of AU$50,000/quality-adjusted life year gained to suggest cost-effectiveness.

Data were collected and analyzed from January 1, 2018, through June 8, 2019. The time horizon is lifetime. Payer and societal perspectives are presented. Probabilistic and 1-way sensitivity analyses evaluate model uncertainty. Interventions: In strategy A, all women with BC underwent BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 testing. In strategy B, only women with BC fulfilling FH or clinical criteria underwent BRCA testing. Affected BRCA/PALB2 carriers could undertake contralateral preventive mastectomy; BRCA carriers could choose risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO).

Results: BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 multigene testing for all patients detected with BC annually would cost pound10 464/QALY (payer perspective) or pound7216/QALY (societal perspective) in the United Kingdom or $65661/QALY (payer perspective) or $61618/QALY (societal perspective) in the United States compared with current BRCA testing based on clinical criteria or FH. This is well below UK and US cost-effectiveness thresholds. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, unselected multigene testing remained cost-effective for 98% to 99% of UK and 64% to 68% of US health system simulations. One year''s unselected multigene testing could prevent 2101 cases of BC and OC and 633 deaths in the United Kingdom and 9733 cases of BC and OC and 2406 deaths in the United States. Correspondingly, 8 excess deaths due to heart disease occurred in the United Kingdom and 35 in the United States annually. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found unselected, high-risk multigene testing for all patients with BC to be extremely cost-effective compared with testing based on FH or clinical criteria for UK and US health systems.

22490,A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Multigene Testing for All Patients With Breast Cancer,"Importance: Moving to multigene testing for all women with breast cancer (BC) could identify many more mutation carriers who can benefit from precision prevention. However, the cost-effectiveness of this approach remains unaddressed. Objective: To estimate incremental lifetime effects, costs, and cost-effectiveness of multigene testing of all patients with BC compared with the current practice of genetic testing (BRCA) based on family history (FH) or clinical criteria. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cost-effectiveness microsimulation modeling study compared lifetime costs and effects of high-risk BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 (multigene) testing of all unselected patients with BC (strategy A) with BRCA1/BRCA2 testing based on FH or clinical criteria (strategy B) in United Kingdom (UK) and US populations. Data were obtained from 11836 patients in population-based BC cohorts (regardless of FH) recruited to 4 large research studies. Data were collected and analyzed from January 1, 2018, through June 8, 2019. The time horizon is lifetime. Payer and societal perspectives are presented. Probabilistic and 1-way sensitivity analyses evaluate model uncertainty. Interventions: In strategy A, all women with BC underwent BRCA1/BRCA2/PALB2 testing. In strategy B, only women with BC fulfilling FH or clinical criteria underwent BRCA testing. Affected BRCA/PALB2 carriers could undertake contralateral preventive mastectomy; BRCA carriers could choose risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO). Relatives of mutation carriers underwent cascade testing. Unaffected relative carriers could undergo magnetic resonance imaging or mammography screening, chemoprevention, or risk-reducing mastectomy for BC risk and RRSO for ovarian cancer (OC) risk. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and compared with standard pound30 000/QALY and $100000/QALY UK and US thresholds, respectively.

22491,Cabozantinib for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Background and aims: The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib is a first-line drug for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Treatment options for patients whose disease has progressed on sorafenib are limited. In a recent randomized controlled trial (CELESTIAL trial), patients with advanced HCC who had failed prior systemic therapy had moderate progression-free survival and overall survival advantages when treated with the multi-kinase inhibitor cabozantinib. However, since this treatment is costly and is accompanied by significant adverse events in a large proportion of patients, its cost-effectiveness in these patients should be determined. Methods: We developed a Markov model incorporating health outcomes, measured by life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of cabozantinib compared with placebo in patients who have failed prior systemic therapy. Results: Treatment with cabozantinib results in a mean gain of 11.6 weeks of life (0.22 life-years) as compared with placebo. When quality of life was incorporated, treatment with cabozantinib produced a gain of 0.16 QALYs. The total mean incremental cost of cabozantinib was US$76,406 per patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for cabozantinib compared with best supportive care was US$469,374/QALY using the recommended dose of 60 mg cabozantinib daily. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the use of cabozantinib in patients with advanced HCC who have progressed on prior treatment, results in a modest incremental benefit with high incremental costs, suggesting that it is not cost-effective at conventional willingness to pay thresholds.",2019-01-31744,31579104,Therap Adv Gastroenterol,Amir Shlomai,2019,12 /,1756284819878304,No,31579104,"Amir Shlomai; Hui Guan; Yang Yu; Hong Ge; Shuchai Zhu; Wei Huang; Baosheng Li; Cabozantinib for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Therap Adv Gastroenterol, 2019; 12():1756-283X; 1756284819878304",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,cabozantinib vs. Placebo,Child-Pugh A liver cirrhosis; failed prior systemic therapy,70 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,60 Months,3.00,0.00,469375,United States,2018,483775.49

22493,Model-Based Economic Evaluation of Ceritinib and Platinum-Based Chemotherapy as First-Line Treatments for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in China,"INTRODUCTION: A trial-based assessment was completed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ceritinib as a first-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase. METHODS: Based on the disease situation of advanced NSCLC, a Markov model was constructed to estimate the costs and benefits of ceritinib and platinum-based chemotherapy. The cost information and health utilities were obtained from published literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. The stability of the model was verified by sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The base case analysis results indicated that compared with platinum-based chemotherapy, ceritinib therapy would increase benefits in a 5-, 10- and 15-year time horizon, with extra costs of $230,661.61, $149,321.52 and $136,414.43 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. The most sensitive parameter in the model analysis was the cost of ceritinib. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that at the current price of ceritinib, the chance of ceritinib being cost-effective was 0 at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $27,142.85 per quality-adjusted life-year (three times the per capita gross domestic product of China). CONCLUSION: As a first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC with rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase, ceritinib is unlikely to be cost-effective at the current price from the Chinese healthcare perspective.

22496,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Of Pregabalin For The Treatment Of Patients With Chronic Cervical Pain With A Neuropathic Component In Japan,"Purpose: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin versus other analgesics among patients with chronic cervical pain with neuropathic components during routine clinical practice in Japan. Patients and methods: The analysis considered patients with chronic cervical pain with a neuropathic pain component (radiating pain to the upper limb) and who were treated with pregabalin with or without other analgesics (pregabalin-containing treatments) or other analgesics alone (usual care) for 8 weeks. Other analgesics included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), weak opioids, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. A Markov cohort simulation model was constructed to estimate costs and effectiveness (in terms of quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs) of each treatment over a 12-month time horizon. In the model, patients transitioned among three states of pain severity (no/mild, moderate, and severe). Data were derived from a previous observational study (pregabalin-containing treatments, n = 138; usual care, n = 211). Cost inputs included medical costs and productivity losses. QALYs were calculated using the EuroQol five-dimensional, five-level questionnaire. The cost-effectiveness was evaluated using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of results. Results: From the payer''s perspective, pregabalin-containing treatments were more costly (JPY 61,779 versus JPY 26,428) but also more effective (0.763 QALYs versus 0.727 QALYs) than the usual care, with an ICER of JPY 970,314 per QALY gained. From the societal perspective, which also included productivity losses, the ICER reduced to JPY 458,307 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the results. Given a hypothetical threshold value of one additional QALY of JPY 5,000,000, the probability of pregabalin-containing treatments being cost-effective was 100%.

22498,A cost-effectiveness analysis of antenatal influenza vaccination among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected pregnant women in South Africa,"BACKGROUND: Pregnant women and infants are at increased risk of severe disease from influenza. Antenatal influenza vaccination is safe and can reduce the risk of illness for women and their infants. We evaluated for South Africa the health effects of antenatal influenza vaccination among pregnant women and their infants aged <6 months old and assessed its cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree model to simulate the population of pregnant women and infants aged <6 months in South Africa using TreeAge Pro Suite 2015. The model evaluated the change in societal costs and outcomes associated with a vaccination campaign that prioritized HIV-infected over HIV-uninfected pregnant women compared with no vaccination. We also examined the impacts of a campaign without prioritization. Upper and lower 90% uncertainty intervals (90% UI) were generated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis on 10000 Monte Carlo simulations. The cost-effectiveness threshold was set to the 2015 per capita gross domestic product of South Africa, US$5724. RESULTS: Antenatal vaccination with prioritization averted 9070 (90% UI: 7407-11217) total cases of influenza among pregnant women and infants, including 411 (90% UI: 305-546) hospitalizations and 30 (90% UI: 22-40) deaths. This corresponds to an averted fraction of 13.5% (90% UI: 9.0-20.5%). Vaccinating without prioritization averted 7801 (90% UI: 6465-9527) cases of influenza, including 335 (90% UI: 254-440) hospitalizations and 24 (90% UI: 18-31) deaths. This corresponds to an averted fraction of 11.6% (90% UI: 7.8-17.4%). Vaccinating the cohort of pregnant women with prioritization had societal cost of $4689 (90% UI: $3128-$7294) per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained while vaccinating without prioritization had a cost of $5924 (90% UI: $3992-$9056) per QALY.

22500,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Influenza A (H1N1) Chemoprophylaxis in Brazil,"Background: Oseltamivir and zanamivir are recommended for treating and preventing influenza A (H1N1) worldwide. In Brazil, this official recommendation lacks an economic evaluation. Our objective was to assess the efficiency of influenza A chemoprophylaxis in the Brazilian context. Methods: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir for prophylaxis of influenza for high risk population, compared to no prophylaxis, in the perspective of Brazilian public health system. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and effectiveness data were based on literature review and costs in Brazilian real (BRL) were estimated from official sources and micro-costing of 2016''s H1N1 admissions at a university hospital. We used a decision-tree model considering prophylaxis and no prophylaxis and the probabilities of H1N1, ambulatory care, admission to hospital, intensive care, patient discharge, and death. Adherence and adverse events from prophylaxis were included. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was converted to 2016 United States dollar (USD). Uncertainty was assessed with univariated and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: Adherence to prophylaxis was 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54; 0.83]; adverse events, 0.09 (95% CI 0.02; 0.18); relative risk of H1N1 infection in chemoprophylaxis, 0.43 (95% CI 0.33; 0.57); incidence of H1N1, 0.14 (95% CI 0.11; 0.16); ambulatory care, 0.67 (95% CI 0.58; 0.75); hospital admission, 0.43 (CI 95% 0.39; 0.42); hospital mortality, 0.14 (CI 95% 0.12; 0.15); intensive care unit admission, 0.23 (95% CI 0.20; 0.27); and intensive care mortality, 0.40 (95% CI 0.29; 0.52). QALY in H1N1 state was 0.50 (95% CI 0.46; 0.53); in H1N1 inpatients, 0.23 (95% CI 0.18; 0.28); healthy, 0.885 (95% CI 0.879; 0.891); death, 0. Adverse events estimated to affect QALY in -0.185 (95% CI -0.290; -0.050). Cost for chemoprophylaxis was BRL 39.42 [standard deviation (SD) 17.94]; ambulatory care, BRL 12.47 (SD 5.21); hospital admission, BRL 5,727.59 (SD 7,758.28); intensive care admission, BRL 19,217.25 (SD 7,917.33); and adverse events, BRL 292.05 (SD 724.95). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was BRL -4,080.63 (USD -1,263.74)/QALY and -982.39 (USD -304.24)/H1N1 prevented. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis.
