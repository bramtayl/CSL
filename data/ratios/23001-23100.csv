23001,CYP2D6*10 pharmacogenetic-guided SERM could be a cost-effective strategy in Chinese patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer,"Aim: To assess the cost-effectiveness of CYP2D6*10 genetic testing for the management of Chinese women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) breast cancer treated with selective estrogen receptor modulator. Methods: A Markov model was developed to evaluate a total expected cost and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Robustness of the model was addressed in one-way analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: The cost of strategies of tamoxifen, toremifene without genotyping and the strategy base on CYP2D6*10 genotype were $63,879.19, $90,156.60 and $95,021.41, and the quality-adjusted life years gained are 8.1588, 12.89687 and 13.85911, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the CYP2D6*10 testing versus toremifene were 5,055.74221/quality-adjusted life year, respectively. Conclusion: CYP2D6*10 pharmacogenetic-guided selective estrogen receptor modulator can be a cost-effective strategy in the Chinese patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.",2020-01-31235,31769341,Pharmacogenomics,XiaoXia Wei,2020,21 / 1,43-53,No,31769341,"XiaoXia Wei; Nadina B Lincoln; Lucy E Bradshaw; Cris S Constantinescu; Florence Day; Avril Er Drummond; Deborah Fitzsimmons; Shaun Harris; Alan A Montgomery; Roshan das Nair; CRAMMS Trial Collaborative Group; CYP2D6*10 pharmacogenetic-guided SERM could be a cost-effective strategy in Chinese patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, Pharmacogenomics, 2020 Jan; 21(1):1462-2416; 43-53",QALY,China,Not Stated,Diagnostic,cyp2d6*10 genetic testing before alternative treatment vs. Toremifene (TOR) without CYP2D6*10 genetic testing,"Hormone receptor-positive (HR+), treated with selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM)",Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,5055.74,United States,2017,5338.13
23002,Assessing the value for money of an integrated health and wellbeing service in the UK,"Lay health workers have been utilized to deliver health promotion programmes in a variety of settings. However, few studies have sought to determine whether these programmes represent value for money, particularly in a UK context. The present study involved an economic evaluation of Wellbeing for Life, an integrated health and wellbeing service in northern England. The service combined one-to-one interventions delivered by lay health workers (known as health trainers), group wellbeing interventions, volunteering opportunities and other community development activities. Value for money was assessed using an established economic model developed with input from a panel of commissioners and providers, and the main data source was the national health trainer data collection and reporting system. Between June 2015 and January 2017, behaviour change outcomes (i.e. whether client goals in relation to diet, physical activity, smoking or other behaviours, had been achieved) were recorded for 2433 of the 3179 individuals who accessed one-to-one interventions. The level of achievement observed gave an estimated total health gain of 287.7 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). In addition, there were 4669 health-promoting events, five asset mapping projects and 1595 occurrences of signposting to other services. Combining the value of individual behaviour change with the value of these additional activities gave an overall net cost per QALY gained of pound3900 and a total estimated societal value of at least pound3.45 for every pound1 spent on the service. These results suggest that the Wellbeing for Life service offered good value for money. Further research is needed to systematically and comprehensively determine the societal value of similar holistic, asset-based and lay-led approaches.",2020-01-31257,31760319,Soc Sci Med,Shelina Visram,2020,245 /,112661,No,31760319,"Shelina Visram; Gunhild Hagen; Jon Magnussen; Grethe Tell; Tone Omsland; Assessing the value for money of an integrated health and wellbeing service in the UK, Soc Sci Med, 2020 Jan; 245():0277-9536; 112661",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior","wellbeing for life, an integrated health and wellbeing service vs. None",Durham county,66 Years,31 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.50,3.50,3900,United Kingdom,2018,5371.27
23003,Cost-Effectiveness of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis Among Adolescent Sexual Minority Males,"PURPOSE: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been proven safe and effective in preventing HIV among adolescent sexual minority males (ASMM), but the cost-effectiveness of PrEP in ASMM remains unknown. Building on a recent epidemiological network modeling study of PrEP among ASMM, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of PrEP use in a high prevalence U.S. setting with significant disparities in HIV between black and white ASMM. METHODS: Based on the estimated number of infections averted and the number of ASMM on PrEP from the previous model and published estimates of PrEP costs, HIV treatment costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per infection prevented, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of PrEP use in black and white ASMM over 10 years using a societal perspective and lifetime horizon. Effectiveness was measured as lifetime QALYs gained. Cost estimates included 10-year PrEP costs and lifetime HIV treatment costs saved. Cost-effectiveness was measured as cost/QALY gained. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed on key model input parameters and assumptions used. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, PrEP use yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $33,064 per QALY in black ASMM and $427,788 per QALY in white ASMM. In all sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness ratio of PrEP use remained <$100,000 per QALY in black ASMM and >$100,000 per QALY in white ASMM. CONCLUSIONS: We found favorable cost-effectiveness ratios for PrEP use among black ASMM or other ASMM in communities with high HIV burden at current PrEP costs.

23005,Cost-effectiveness of second-line vasopressors for the treatment of septic shock,"PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of escalating doses of norepinephrine or norepinephrine plus the adjunctive use of vasopressin or angiotensin II as a second-line vasopressor for septic shock. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision tree analysis was performed to compare costs and outcomes associated with norepinephrine monotherapy or the two adjunctive second-line vasopressors.

Costs were modeled from a payer''s perspective, with a willingness-to-pay threshold set at $100,000/unit gained. One-way (tornado diagrams) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Adjunctive vasopressin was the most cost-effective therapy, and dominated both norepinephrine monotherapy and adjunctive angiotensin II by producing higher ICU survival at less cost. For the lifetime horizon, while norepinephrine monotherapy was least expensive, adjunctive vasopressin was the most cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,762 / QALY gained.

23008,Economic Evaluation of Extending Medicare Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Kidney Transplant Recipients in the Current Era,"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplant recipients must take immunosuppressant drugs to prevent rejection and maintain transplant function. Medicare coverage of immunosuppressant drugs for kidney transplant recipients ceases 36 months after transplantation, potentially increasing the risk of transplant failure. A contemporary economic analysis of extending Medicare coverage for the duration of transplant survival using current costs of immunosuppressant medications in the era of generic equivalents may inform immunosuppressant drug policy. METHODS: A Markov model was used to determine the incremental cost and effectiveness of extending Medicare coverage for immunosuppressive drugs over the duration of transplant survival, compared with the current policy of 36-month coverage, from the perspective of the Medicare payer. The expected improvement in transplant survival by extending immunosuppressive drug coverage was estimated from a cohort of privately insured transplant recipients who receive lifelong immunosuppressant drug coverage compared with a cohort of Medicare-insured transplant recipients, using multivariable survival analysis. RESULTS: Extension of immunosuppression Medicare coverage for kidney transplant recipients led to lower costs of -$3077 and 0.37 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient. When the improvement in transplant survival associated with extending immunosuppressant coverage was reduced to 50% of that observed in privately insured patients, the strategy of extending drug coverage had an incremental cost-utility ratio of $51,694 per QALY gained. In a threshold analysis, the extension of immunosuppression coverage was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000, $50,000, and $0 per QALY if it results in a decrease in risk of transplant failure of 5.5%, 7.8%, and 13.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Extending immunosuppressive drug coverage under Medicare from the current 36 months to the duration of transplant survival will result in better patient outcomes and cost-savings, and remains cost-effective if only a fraction of anticipated benefit is realized.",2020-01-31419,31704739,J Am Soc Nephrol,Matthew Kadatz,2020,31 / 1,218-228,No,31704739,"Matthew Kadatz; Jade Johnson; Isabelle Chaudieu; Karen Ritchie; Jacqueline Scali; Marie-Laure Ancelin; Joanne Ryan; Economic Evaluation of Extending Medicare Immunosuppressive Drug Coverage for Kidney Transplant Recipients in the Current Era, J Am Soc Nephrol, 2020 Jan; 31(1):1046-6673; 218-228",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,extending medicare coverage for immunosuppressive drugs over the duration of transplant survival vs. Standard/Usual Care- 36 months Medicare coverage of immunosuppressive drugs,survived with a functioning transplant for =>36 months,62 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-8316.22,United States,2018,-8571.36
23009,"Economic impact of implementing decennial tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination in adults in the United States","BACKGROUND: In the United States, persons >/=11 years are recommended to receive one dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine, followed by decennial tetanus- and diphtheria-toxoid (Td) boosters. Many providers use Tdap instead of Td. We evaluated epidemiologic and economic impacts of replacing Td boosters with Tdap. METHODS: We used a static cohort model to examine replacing Td with Tdap over the lifetime of 4,386,854 adults >/=21 years. Because pertussis is underdiagnosed and true incidence is unknown, we varied incidence from 2.5 cases/100,000 person-years to 500 cases/100,000 person-years. We calculated vaccine and medical costs from claims data. We estimated cost per case prevented and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved; sensitivity analyses were conducted on vaccine effectiveness (VE), protection duration, vaccine cost, disease duration, hospitalization rates, productivity loss and missed work. We did not include programmatic advantages resulting from use of a single tetanus-toxoid containing vaccine. RESULTS: At lowest incidence estimates, administering Tdap resulted in high costs per averted case ($111,540) and QALY saved ($8,972,848). As incidence increased, cases averted increased and cost per QALY saved decreased rapidly. With incidence estimates of 250 cases/100,000 person-years, cost per averted case and QALY saved were $984 and $81,678 respectively; at 500 cases/100,000 person-years, these values were $427 and $35,474. In multivariate sensitivity analyses, assuming 250 cases/100,000 person-years, estimated cost per QALY saved ranged from $971 (most favorable) to $217,370 (least favorable). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that replacing Td with Tdap for the decennial booster would result in high cost per QALY saved based on reported cases. However, programmatic considerations were not accounted for, and if pertussis incidence, which is incompletely measured, is assumed to be higher than reported through national surveillance, substituting Tdap for Td may lead to moderate decreases in pertussis cases and cost per QALY.",2020-01-31510,31676198,Vaccine,Fiona P Havers,2020,38 / 2,380-387,Yes,31676198,"Fiona P Havers; Maria M Trujillo-Martin; Yolanda Ramallo-Farina; Tasmania Del Pino-Sedeno; Inigo Rua-Figueroa; Elisa Trujillo-Martin; Laura Vallejo-Torres; Inaki Imaz-Iglesia; Ricardo Sanchez-de-Madariaga; Ana M de Pascual-Medina; Pedro Serrano-Aguilar; SLE-CPG-Implementation Group; Economic impact of implementing decennial tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination in adults in the United States, Vaccine, 2020 Jan 10; 38(2):1873-2518; 380-387",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Immunization,"decennial tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (tdap) vaccine vs. Standard/Usual Care- Decennial Tetanus toxoid and reduced diphtheria toxoid vaccine (td) booster",Not Stated,Not Stated,21 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-33092.29,United States,2017,-34940.63

Recent studies have implied that operative treatment might result in a faster return to work, resulting in a decreased productivity loss for society. The cost utility of plate fixation vs. nonoperative treatment of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures has not previously been investigated using a societal perspective.

23012,The testing of people with any risk factor for hepatitis C in community pharmacies is cost-effective,"New antiviral drugs with high efficacy mean the hepatitis C virus (HCV) can now be eliminated. To achieve this, it is necessary to identify undiagnosed cases of HCV. However, the costs of testing should be considered when judging the overall cost-effectiveness of treatment. This study describes the cost-effectiveness of a community pharmacy testing service in a population of people at risk of HCV living on the Isle of Wight (United Kingdom). Dry blood spot testing was conducted in anyone with a known risk factor for HCV in 20 community pharmacies. The outcomes and costs were entered into a Markov model. Cost and health utilities from the model were used to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In 24 months, 186 tests were conducted, 13 were positive for HCV RNA and six of these (46%) received treatment during the follow-up period. All achieved a sustained virological response at 3 months. The overall cost of the testing and treatment intervention was pound242 183, and the ICER for the service was pound3689 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. If screening had been restricted to just people with a history of injecting drug use (PWID) the ICER would have been pound4865 per QALY gained. The service was effective at identifying people with HCV infection, and despite the additional cost of targeted testing, its cost-effectiveness was below the commonly accepted thresholds.

Cost and health utilities from the model were used to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). In 24 months, 186 tests were conducted, 13 were positive for HCV RNA and six of these (46%) received treatment during the follow-up period. All achieved a sustained virological response at 3 months. The overall cost of the testing and treatment intervention was pound242 183, and the ICER for the service was pound3689 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. If screening had been restricted to just people with a history of injecting drug use (PWID) the ICER would have been pound4865 per QALY gained. The service was effective at identifying people with HCV infection, and despite the additional cost of targeted testing, its cost-effectiveness was below the commonly accepted thresholds. In this setting, restricting targeted testing to PWID would not improve the cost-effectiveness.",2020-01-31909,31520434,J Viral Hepat,Ryan Buchanan,2020,27 / 1,36-44,No,31520434,"Ryan Buchanan; Olivia Spiegler; Ralf Wolfer; Miles Hewstone; The testing of people with any risk factor for hepatitis C in community pharmacies is cost-effective, J Viral Hepat, 2020 Jan; 27(1):1352-0504; 36-44",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Screening,community pharmacy testing service vs. Standard/Usual Care- Background testing,Risk factor for HCV,79 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.50,Not Stated,4865,United Kingdom,2018,6700.31
23014,A comparative cost-utility analysis of postoperative calcium supplementation strategies used in the current management of hypocalcemia,"BACKGROUND: Symptomatic hypocalcemia is a common complication of total thyroidectomy. Management strategies include responsive treatment initiation for symptoms or prevention by routine or parathyroid hormone-directed calcium supplementation. The comparative cost-effectiveness of even the most often utilized strategies is unclear. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was created to compare routine supplementation with calcium alone (RS), postoperative parathyroid hormone-based selective supplementation with calcium and calcitriol (SS), and no supplementation (NS) in asymptomatic patients. Patients could remain asymptomatic or develop symptomatic hypocalcemia, managed with outpatient oral supplementation or intravenous calcium infusion and administered either inpatient or outpatient. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test model parameter assumptions. RESULTS: RS was the preferred strategy, costing $329/patient and resulting in 0.497 quality-adjusted life years, which was only marginally better compared to SS ($373 for 0.495 quality-adjusted life years). NS was most costly at $4,955 for 0.491 quality-adjusted life years. Preference for RS over SS was sensitive to the probability of developing symptoms and the probability of symptom treatment with intravenous supplementation. On probabilistic sensitivity analysis, RS was preferred in 75.4% of scenarios. CONCLUSION: After total thyroidectomy, a preventative calcium supplementation strategy should be strongly considered.

23016,Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe uncontrolled allergic asthma in the United States,"Objective: Uncontrolled asthma is associated with considerable clinical burden and costs to payers and patients. US economic models evaluating biologics using data from clinical trials demonstrate high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), but the cost-effectiveness based on real-world treatment patterns is unknown. This analysis used real-world evidence to assess the cost-effectiveness of adding omalizumab to standard of care (SOC).Methods: A Markov model was applied to track patients'' health states in 2-week cycles, comparing costs and treatment effects of SOC alone versus SOC + omalizumab over a lifetime (US payer perspective). Outcomes included exacerbation events, life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total costs, and an ICER. Patient characteristics, exacerbations, patient-reported outcomes, and work productivity were derived from the real-world PROSPERO (Prospective Study to Evaluate Predictors of Clinical Effectiveness in Response to Omalizumab) study. Published literature informed mortality, exacerbation-related disutility, and unit costs. Sensitivity analyses assessed model robustness.Results: Over a lifetime horizon, omalizumab was associated with an increase of 2.0 QALYs at a cost of $US 148,319 in patients with uncontrolled asthma (ICER of $75,319/QALY gained) and a reduction in exacerbations of 6.0 events/patient. Accounting for responder status improved the ICER ($70,505/QALY); incorporating indirect costs further reduced the ICER. One-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses confirmed that the base case outcome was robust to variation in inputs.Conclusions: Based on real-world outcomes, omalizumab may be cost-effective for uncontrolled asthma from the US payer perspective. Including broader evidence on treatment discontinuation, caregiver burden, and oral corticosteroid reduction from real-world studies may better reflect the effects and value of omalizumab for all healthcare stakeholders.",2020-01-31991,31491337,Curr Med Res Opin,Patrick W Sullivan,2020,36 / 1,23-32,No,31491337,"Patrick W Sullivan; Thomas E Kottke; Marcia Lowry; Juliana O Tillema; Jeanette Y Ziegenfuss; Meghan M JaKa; Kevin D Campbell; Jason M Gallagher; Chad C Heim; Nicolaas P Pronk; Susan M Knudson; Cost-effectiveness of omalizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe uncontrolled allergic asthma in the United States, Curr Med Res Opin, 2020 Jan; 36(1):0300-7995; 23-32",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,omalizumab + standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Steroids and/or bronchodilators,Moderate-to-severe uncontrolled allergic asthma,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,75319,United States,2018,77629.8

23020,"Cost-Effectiveness of Screening Ultrasound after a First, Febrile Urinary Tract Infection in Children Age 2-24 Months","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of routine, screening renal bladder ultrasound (RBUS) for children age 2-24 months after a first febrile urinary tract infection (UTI), as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. STUDY DESIGN: We developed a decision analytic model that simulates a population of children after a first febrile UTI. The model incorporates the diagnostic utility of RBUS to detect vesicoureteral reflux and genitourinary anomalies. We adopted a health-system perspective, 5-year horizon, and included 1-way and 2-way sensitivity analyses. Costs were inflated to 2018 US dollars, and our model incorporated a 3% discounting rate. We compared routine RBUS after first, febrile UTI compared with routine RBUS after second UTI (ie, control arm). Our main outcomes were recurrent UTI rate and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Among children 2-24 months after a first febrile UTI, RBUS had an overall accuracy (true positives + true negatives) of 64.4%. The recurrent UTI rate in the intervention arm was 19.9% compared with 21.0% in the control arm. Thus, 91 patients would need to be screened with RBUS to prevent 1 recurrent UTI. RBUS increases QALYs by +0.0002 per patient screened, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $803 000/QALY gained. In the RBUS arm, 20.6% of children would receive unnecessary voiding cystourethrograms compared with 12.2% of children in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Screening RBUS after a first, febrile UTI in children age 2-24 months does not meet cost-effectiveness guidelines.

METHODS: Two hundred and eleven children (7-12 years, 85% White British, 52% female) with a primary anxiety disorder, whose mothers also had a current anxiety disorder, were randomised to receive (a) child-focused CBT with nonspecific control interventions (CCBT+Con), (b) CCBT with CBT for the maternal anxiety disorder (CCBT+MCBT), or (c) CCBT with an intervention targeting the mother-child interaction (CCBT+MCI). A cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective was conducted using mother/child combined quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). [Trial registration: https://doi.org/10.1186/isrctn19762288]. RESULTS: MCBT was associated with immediate reductions in maternal anxiety compared to the nonspecific control; however, after children had also received CCBT, maternal outcomes in the CCBT+MCI and CCBT+Con arms improved and CCBT+MCBT was no longer superior.

23023,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Baseline Testing for Resistance-Associated Polymorphisms to Optimize Treatment Outcome in Genotype 1 Noncirrhotic Treatment-Naive Patients With Chronic Hepatitis C Virus,"OBJECTIVES: Direct-acting antivirals containing nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitors administered over 8 to 12 weeks are effective in approximately 95% of patients with hepatitis C virus. Nevertheless, patients resistant to NS5A inhibitors have lower cure rates over 8 weeks (<85%); for these patients, 12 weeks of treatment produces cure rates greater than 95%. We evaluated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of testing for NS5A resistance at baseline and optimizing treatment duration accordingly in genotype 1 noncirrhotic treatment-naive patients from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: A decision-analytic model compared (1) standard 12-week treatment (no testing), (2) shortened 8-week treatment (no testing), and (3) baseline testing with 12-/8-week treatment for those with/without NS5A polymorphisms. Patients who failed first-line therapy were retreated for 12 weeks. Model inputs were derived from published studies. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and the probability of cost-effectiveness were calculated. RESULTS: Baseline testing had an incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of pound11 838 versus standard 12 weeks of therapy (no testing) and low probability (31%) of being the most cost-effective, assuming pound30 000 willingness to pay. Shortened 8 weeks of treatment (no testing) had an INMB of pound12 294 and the highest probability (69%) of being most cost-effective. Scenario analyses showed baseline testing generally had the highest INMB and probability of being most cost-effective if first- and second-line drug prices were low (< pound20k).

Nevertheless, patients resistant to NS5A inhibitors have lower cure rates over 8 weeks (<85%); for these patients, 12 weeks of treatment produces cure rates greater than 95%. We evaluated the lifetime cost-effectiveness of testing for NS5A resistance at baseline and optimizing treatment duration accordingly in genotype 1 noncirrhotic treatment-naive patients from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: A decision-analytic model compared (1) standard 12-week treatment (no testing), (2) shortened 8-week treatment (no testing), and (3) baseline testing with 12-/8-week treatment for those with/without NS5A polymorphisms. Patients who failed first-line therapy were retreated for 12 weeks. Model inputs were derived from published studies. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and the probability of cost-effectiveness were calculated. RESULTS: Baseline testing had an incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of pound11 838 versus standard 12 weeks of therapy (no testing) and low probability (31%) of being the most cost-effective, assuming pound30 000 willingness to pay. Shortened 8 weeks of treatment (no testing) had an INMB of pound12 294 and the highest probability (69%) of being most cost-effective. Scenario analyses showed baseline testing generally had the highest INMB and probability of being most cost-effective if first- and second-line drug prices were low (< pound20k).

23025,Cost-Effectiveness of Multigene Pharmacogenetic Testing in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of multigene testing (CYP2C19, SLCO1B1, CYP2C9, VKORC1) compared with single-gene testing (CYP2C19) and standard of care (no genotyping) in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from Medicare''s perspective. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was developed to simulate patients post-PCI for ACS requiring antiplatelet therapy (CYP2C19 to guide antiplatelet selection), statin therapy (SLCO1B1 to guide statin selection), and anticoagulant therapy in those that develop atrial fibrillation (CYP2C9/VKORC1 to guide warfarin dose) over 12 months, 24 months, and lifetime. The primary outcome was cost (2016 US dollar) per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) varied input parameters (event probabilities, prescription costs, event costs, health-state utilities) to estimate changes in the cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Base-case-discounted results indicated that the cost per QALY gained was $59 876, $33 512, and $3780 at 12 months, 24 months, and lifetime, respectively, for multigene testing compared with standard of care.

23031,Sacubitril-Valsartan Compared With Enalapril for the Treatment of Heart Failure: A Decision-Analytic Markov Model Simulation in China,"OBJECTIVES: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a major health concern globally due to high mortality rates, frequent hospitalization and considerable medical expenditure. The prevalence of HFrEF is steadily rising in Asian countries, and populous, developing countries like China are facing a significant socio-economic burden as a result. Sacubitril-valsartan (Sac-Val) is currently a class I recommendation for treating HFrEF in major guidelines, although it has not been pharmaco-economically evaluated in China. To this end, we compared the cost-effectiveness of Sac-Val and enalapril based on the negotiated prices in order to fully assess the expected costs and benefits of the clinical use of Sac-Val in China. METHOD: A Markov model was constructed to estimate long-term clinical and economic outcomes of Sac-Val versus enalapril for HFrEF patients in China over a 10-year horizon. Primary model outcomes were total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Treatment with Sac-Val resulted in 4.67 QALYs at the cost of $4,684.25, while enalapril yielded 4.40 QALYs at the cost of $4,014.47. Compared to enalapril, Sac-Val was associated with a gain of 0.27 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $ 2,480.67 per QALY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis showed robust results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that Sac-Val has a 99.99% probability of being cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $10,276. CONCLUSION: From Chinese patients'' perspective, Sac-Val is a cost-effective treatment option for HFrEF in China compared to enalapril.

23044,Cost-effectiveness analysis of two kinds of bladder cancer urinary diversion: Studer versus Bricker,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study was to evaluated the cost-effectiveness of two bladder cancer (BCa) urinary diversions: Studer and Bricker. METHODS: The study included 44 patients with Studer and 40 patients with Bricker. Collected and analyzed the patient''s basic characteristics, health care costs, and prognosis survival. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were calculated and verified by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ-C30, Version 3, Chinese version). Cost-effectiveness depends on the incremental cost per QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was determined using the cost/QALY. RESULTS: We found the average total cost of the Studer group was $7,173.7±1,390.8, and the Bricker group was $6,545.2±1,458.4. There were significant differences in hospitalization time, total hospitalization expenses, bed cost, comprehensive medical service charge and drugs cost (all P<0.05).

23052,Lixisenatide for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients Inadequately Controlled on Oral Antidiabetic Drugs: A Mixed-Treatment Comparison Meta-analysis and Cost-Utility Analysis,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety and cost-utility (from the Chinese health insurance perspective) of lixisenatide and insulin regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of English (PubMed and Cochrane Library) and Chinese (CNKI and WanFang) language databases was performed, and head-to-head relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved and analyzed by performing a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis for efficacy and safety endpoints. A cost-utility analysis was then conducted using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model to compare the lifetime pharmacoeconomic profiles among the treatment groups. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs were included in this MTC meta-analysis. Regarding glycated hemoglobin targets, lixisenatide was similar to both basal insulin (mean difference [MD] 0.27%; 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.02%, 0.57%) and premixed insulin (MD?0.32%; 95% CrI -?0.01%, 0.66%), respectively. Statistically significant differences were found for changes in body weight in favor of lixisenatide compared with basal insulin (MD?-?3.22 kg; 95% CrI -?5.51 kg, -?0.94 kg) and premixed insulin (MD?-?2.68 kg; 95% CrI -?5.16 kg, -?0.20 kg). The relative risk (RR) of symptomatic hypoglycemia associated with lixisenatide was also significantly lower than that associated with basal insulin (RR?0.22; 95% CrI 0.09, 0.52) and premixed insulin (RR?0.17; 95% CrI 0.07, 0.41).

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of English (PubMed and Cochrane Library) and Chinese (CNKI and WanFang) language databases was performed, and head-to-head relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved and analyzed by performing a mixed-treatment comparison (MTC) meta-analysis for efficacy and safety endpoints. A cost-utility analysis was then conducted using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model to compare the lifetime pharmacoeconomic profiles among the treatment groups. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs were included in this MTC meta-analysis. Regarding glycated hemoglobin targets, lixisenatide was similar to both basal insulin (mean difference [MD] 0.27%; 95% credible interval [CrI] 0.02%, 0.57%) and premixed insulin (MD?0.32%; 95% CrI -?0.01%, 0.66%), respectively. Statistically significant differences were found for changes in body weight in favor of lixisenatide compared with basal insulin (MD?-?3.22 kg; 95% CrI -?5.51 kg, -?0.94 kg) and premixed insulin (MD?-?2.68 kg; 95% CrI -?5.16 kg, -?0.20 kg).

23055,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Linagliptin in Japan Based on Results from the Asian Subpopulation in the CARMELINA(®) Trial,"INTRODUCTION: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of linagliptin in Japan by estimating the lifetime outcome based on clinical event rates from the Asian subpopulation of the CARMELINA trial. In CARMELINA, linagliptin added to standard of care (SoC) versus SoC demonstrated noninferiority with regard to risk of composite cardiovascular (CV) outcome in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk of CV and kidney events. Issues resulting from conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis using data from a clinical noninferiority study were also investigated. METHODS: A microsimulation model was used to evaluate linagliptin/SoC versus SoC in terms of direct costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from a Japanese public healthcare payer''s perspective. Cost data were obtained from recent Japanese publications. The time horizon was defined as lifetime, and the discount rate for costs and effectiveness was 2% per year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, and taking medical history into account, the incremental effectiveness of linagliptin/SoC versus SoC was 1.34 QALYs, and the incremental cost for linagliptin was -?545,319 yen. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the parameter which most affected the results was the hazard ratio for renal failure of linagliptin/SoC compared with SoC. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of reduced costs and increased effectiveness (dominant) was 48%. Assuming an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold of 5 million yen, the probability that the ICER was below the threshold was 89% for linagliptin/SoC compared with SoC. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation, using Asian subpopulation data from the CARMELINA trial, suggested that the cost-effectiveness of linagliptin for a lifetime outcome was favourable in Japan.

23064,Expanding Antiviral Prophylaxis During Pregnancy to Prevent Perinatal Hepatitis B Virus Infection: A Cost-effectiveness Study,"BACKGROUND: Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) cannot be completely prevented by the administration of active-passive immunoprophylaxis in pregnant women with hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels <10(6) copies/mL. This study will assess the economic outcomes of expanding antiviral prophylaxis in pregnant women with HBV DNA levels <10(6) copies/mL. METHODS: A decision model was adopted to measure the economic outcomes of expanded antiviral prophylaxis at different cutoff values of HBV DNA in HBsAg(+) pregnant women in the context of the United States and China.

23076,Cost-effectiveness of adding atezolizumab to first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel for advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been demonstrated. We aimed to evaluate its cost-effectiveness on advanced TNBC from the US payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was adopted to project the disease course of newly diagnosed advanced TNBC. The clinical data were gathered from the IMpassion130 trial. Cost and health preference data were derived from the literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured, and one-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed for exploring the model uncertainties. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel augmented versus nab-paclitaxel therapy cost $104,278 and $149,465 and yielded an additional 0.371 and 0.762 of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in in all patients with unknown PD-L1 status and subpopulation with PD-L1-positive, respectively, which led to an ICER of $281,448 and $196,073 per QALY gained. In all patients with unknown PD-L1 status, atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel treatment guiding by PD-L1 expression testing resulted in an ICER of $183,508 per QALY gained.

METHODS: We used a Markov microsimulation model to compare the cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid with alendronate in Chinese postmenopausal osteoporotic women with no fracture history at various ages of therapy initiation from health care payer perspective. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the zoledronic acid versus alendronate were $23,581/QALY at age 65 years, $17,367/QALY at age 70 years, $14,714/QALY at age 75 years, and $12,169/QALY at age 80 years, respectively. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, the study demonstrated that the two most impactful parameters were the annual cost of zoledronic acid and the relative risk of hip fracture with zoledronic acid. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probabilities of zoledronic acid being cost-effective compared with alendronate were 70-100% at a willingness-to-pay of $29,340 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Among postmenopausal osteoporotic women in China, zoledronic acid therapy is cost-effective at all ages examined from health care payer perspective, compared with weekly oral alendronate.

23083,"Long-Term Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Videoconference-Delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Social Anxiety Disorder in Japan: One-Year Follow-Up of a Single-Arm Trial","BACKGROUND: Face-to-face individual cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and internet-based CBT (ICBT) without videoconferencing are known to have long-term effectiveness for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder (PD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). However, videoconference-delivered CBT (VCBT) has not been investigated regarding its long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of VCBT for patients with OCD, PD, or SAD in Japan via a 1-year follow-up to our previous 16-week single-arm study. METHODS: Written informed consent was obtained from 25 of 29 eligible patients with OCD, PD, and SAD who had completed VCBT in our clinical trial. Participants were assessed at baseline, end of treatment, and at the follow-up end points of 3, 6, and 12 months. Outcomes were the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS), Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and EuroQol-5D-5L (EQ-5D-5L). To analyze long-term effectiveness, we used mixed-model analysis of variance. To analyze cost-effectiveness, we employed relevant public data and derived data on VCBT implementation costs from Japanese national health insurance data. RESULTS: Four males and 21 females with an average age of 35.1 (SD 8.6) years participated in the 1-year follow-up study. Principal diagnoses were OCD (n=10), PD (n=7), and SAD (n=8). The change at 12 months on the Y-BOCS was -4.1 (F(1)=4.45, P=.04), the change in PDSS was -4.4 (F(1)=6.83, P=.001), and the change in LSAS was -30.9 (F(1)=6.73, P=.01). The change in the PHQ-9 at 12 months was -2.7 (F(1)=7.72, P=.007), and the change in the GAD-7 was -3.0 (F(1)=7.09, P=.009). QALY at 12 months was 0.7469 (SE 0.0353, 95% Cl 0.6728-0.821), and the change was a significant increase of 0.0379 (P=.01). Total costs to provide the VCBT were ¥60,800 to ¥81,960 per patient. The set threshold was ¥189,500 ($1723, €1579, and £1354) calculated based on willingness to pay in Japan. CONCLUSIONS: VCBT was a cost-effective way to effectively treat Japanese patients with OCD, PD, or SAD.

This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of six pharmacotherapies and lifestyle intervention for people with mild obesity (body mass indices [BMIs] 30 to 35). METHODS: A microsimulation model was constructed to compare seven weight loss strategies plus no treatment: intensive lifestyle intervention, orlistat, phentermine, phentermine/topiramate, lorcaserin, liraglutide, and semaglutide. Weight loss, quality-of-life scores, and costs were estimated using clinical trials and other published literature. Endpoints included costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000/QALY. Results were analysed at 1-, 3-, and 5-year time horizons. RESULTS: At each of the three follow-up periods, phentermine was the cost-effective strategy, with ICERs of $46 258/QALY, $20 157/QALY, and $17 880/QALY after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.

METHODS: A microsimulation model was constructed to compare seven weight loss strategies plus no treatment: intensive lifestyle intervention, orlistat, phentermine, phentermine/topiramate, lorcaserin, liraglutide, and semaglutide. Weight loss, quality-of-life scores, and costs were estimated using clinical trials and other published literature. Endpoints included costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000/QALY. Results were analysed at 1-, 3-, and 5-year time horizons. RESULTS: At each of the three follow-up periods, phentermine was the cost-effective strategy, with ICERs of $46 258/QALY, $20 157/QALY, and $17 880/QALY after 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Semaglutide was the most effective strategy in the 3- and 5-year time horizons, with total QALYs of 2.224 and 3.711, respectively. However, the ICERs were prohibitively high at $1 437 340/QALY after 3 years and $576 931/QALY after 5 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated these results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Phentermine is the cost-effective pharmacologic weight-loss strategy. Although semaglutide is the most effective, it is not cost-effective because of its high price.",2020-01-32731,32313674,Obes Sci Pract,Minyi Lee,2020,6 / 2,162-170,No,32313674,"Minyi Lee; Brianna N Lauren; Tiannan Zhan; Jin Choi; Matthew Klebanoff; Barham Abu Dayyeh; Elsie M Taveras; Kathleen Corey; Lee Kaplan; Chin Hur; The cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and lifestyle intervention in the treatment of obesity, Obes Sci Pract, 2020 Apr; 6(2):2055-2238; 162-170",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,liraglutide vs. Lorcaserin,Year 5 diagnosis,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 1, 3 years",3.00,3.00,3673990.91,United States,2019,3719316.35
