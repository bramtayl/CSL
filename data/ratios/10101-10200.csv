10101,Cost-effectiveness of optimizing prevention in patients with coronary heart disease: the EUROASPIRE III health economics project,"Aims The EUROASPIRE III survey indicated that the guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention are poorly implemented in patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD). The purpose of this health economic project was to assess the potential clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of optimizing cardiovascular prevention in eight EUROASPIRE III countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Poland, and the UK). Methods and results The individual risk for subsequent cardiovascular events was estimated, based on published Framingham equations. Based on the EUROASPIRE III data, the type of suboptimal prevention, if any, was identified for each individual, and the effects of optimized tailored prevention (smoking cessation, diet and exercise, better management of elevated blood pressure and/or LDL-cholesterol) were estimated. Costs of prevention and savings of avoided events were based on country-specific data. A willingness to pay threshold of ?30 000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used. The robustness of the results was validated by sensitivity analyses. Overall, the cost-effectiveness analyses for the eight countries showed mainly favourable results with an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ?12 484 per QALY. Only in the minority of patients at the lowest risk for recurrent events, intensifying preventive therapy seems not cost-effective. Also, the single impact of intensified cholesterol control seems less cost-effective, possibly because their initial 2-year risk was already fairly low, hence the room for improvement is rather limited. Conclusion These results underscore the societal value of optimizing prevention in most patients with established CHD, but also highlight the need for setting priorities towards patients more at risk and the need for more studies comparing intensified prevention with usual care in these patients.",2012-01-09556,22843446,Eur Heart J,Delphine De Smedt,2012,33 / 22,2865-72,No,22843446,"Delphine De Smedt; Kornelia Kotseva; Dirk De Bacquer; David Wood; Guy De Backer; Jean Dallongeville; Lehto Seppo; Andrzej Pajak; Zeljko Reiner; Diego Vanuzzo; Borislav Georgiev; Nina Gotcheva; Lieven Annemans; Cost-effectiveness of optimizing prevention in patients with coronary heart disease: the EUROASPIRE III health economics project, Eur Heart J, ; 33(22):0195-668X; 2865-72",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Optimized tailored prevention for every individual (smoking cessation, diet and exercise, better management of elevated blood pressure and/or LDL-cholesterol) vs. Usual care",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,12840,Euro,2010,20168.93

10105,Cost-effectiveness comparison of response strategies to a large-scale anthrax attack on the chicago metropolitan area: impact of timing and surge capacity,"Rapid public health response to a large-scale anthrax attack would reduce overall morbidity and mortality. However, there is uncertainty about the optimal cost-effective response strategy based on timing of intervention, public health resources, and critical care facilities. We conducted a decision analytic study to compare response strategies to a theoretical large-scale anthrax attack on the Chicago metropolitan area beginning either Day 2 or Day 5 after the attack. These strategies correspond to the policy options set forth by the Anthrax Modeling Working Group for population-wide responses to a large-scale anthrax attack: (1) postattack antibiotic prophylaxis, (2) postattack antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccination, (3) preattack vaccination with postattack antibiotic prophylaxis, and (4) preattack vaccination with postattack antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccination. Outcomes were measured in costs, lives saved, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We estimated that postattack antibiotic prophylaxis of all 1,390,000 anthrax-exposed people beginning on Day 2 after attack would result in 205,835 infected victims, 35,049 fulminant victims, and 28,612 deaths. Only 6,437 (18.5%) of the fulminant victims could be saved with the existing critical care facilities in the Chicago metropolitan area. Mortality would increase to 69,136 if the response strategy began on Day 5. Including postattack vaccination with antibiotic prophylaxis of all exposed people reduces mortality and is cost-effective for both Day 2 (ICER=$182/QALY) and Day 5 (ICER=$1,088/QALY) response strategies. Increasing ICU bed availability significantly reduces mortality for all response strategies. We conclude that postattack antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccination of all exposed people is the optimal cost-effective response strategy for a large-scale anthrax attack. Our findings support the US government's plan to provide antibiotic prophylaxis and vaccination for all exposed people within 48 hours of the recognition of a large-scale anthrax attack.

10111,Clopidogrel versus aspirin in patients with atherothrombosis: a CAPRIE-based cost-effectiveness model for Greece,"Atherothrombosis represents a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Given the prominent role of platelet aggregation in atherothrombosis, antiplatelet therapy forms the cornerstone of treatment, with proven efficacy in the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events. Although clopidogrel seems to be superior to aspirin in terms of risk reduction for an atherothrombotic event, whether this clinical advantage is cost effective in Greece is unknown.The aim of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing clopidogrel with aspirin in the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with peripheral artery disease, a recent stroke or a recent myocardial infarction, from the third-party-payer perspective in Greece.A Markov model with a 6-month cycle length was developed. Transition probabilities used in the model were obtained from the event rates reported in the CAPRIE trial. The effect of clopidogrel was applied only during the first 2 years of the model. Utility data were used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs (for the year 2012) assigned to each health state included antiplatelet treatment cost, cost for the management of adverse events related to antiplatelet therapy and the direct healthcare cost of patients (i.e. concomitant medication, hospitalization, outpatient visits, rehabilitation, laboratory and imaging diagnostic examinations as well as interventions) in the acute and follow-up phase, separately. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated for life-years (LYs) and QALYs, separately. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted in order to evaluate the impact of the variation that characterizes the majority of model parameters to the cost-effectiveness results.The Markov analysis revealed that the discounted survival was 11.83 (95% CI 11.40, 12.22) years and 12.17 (95% CI 11.75, 12.55) years in the aspirin and clopidogrel treatment groups, respectively, a difference of 0.34 (95% CI 0.09, 0.618) LYs. The corresponding discounted QALYs were 8.63 (95% CI 8.34, 8.90) and 8.84 (95% CI 8.54, 9.10), respectively, a difference of 0.21 (95% CI 0.05, 0.37) QALYs. The cumulated lifetime costs per patient were ?20 678 (95% CI 19 675, 21 724) and ?21 688 (95% CI 20 649, 22 773), for aspirin and clopidogrel treatment arm, respectively. The ICER for clopidogrel was calculated to be ?4038 (95% CI 2743, 7837) for each LY saved and ?5518 (95% CI 3358, 12 921) for each QALY saved.The analysis indicates that clopidogrel is cost effective for the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in the Greek setting.

10117,Economic evaluation of a participatory return-to-work intervention for temporary agency and unemployed workers sick-listed due to musculoskeletal disorders,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness, -utility, and -benefit of a newly developed participatory return-to-work (RTW) program for temporary agency and unemployed workers, sick-listed due to musculoskeletal disorders. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up. Temporary agency and unemployed workers, sick-listed for 2aeuro""8 weeks due to musculoskeletal disorders, were randomized to the participatory RTW program (N=79) or usual care group (N=84). The new RTW program was aimed at making a consensus-based RTW action plan with the possibility of a temporary (therapeutic) workplace. Effect outcomes were sustainable RTW and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Healthcare utilization was measured from the social insureraeuros perspective and societal perspective. RESULTS: Total healthcare costs in the participatory RTW program group [10 189 (standard deviation [SD] 7055) euros] were statistically significantly higher compared to care-as-usual [7862 (SD 7394) euros]. The cost-effectiveness analyses showed that the new intervention was more effective but also more costly than usual care (ie, to gain RTW one day earlier in the participatory RTW program group approximately 80 euros needed to be invested). The net societal benefit of the participatory RTW program compared to care-as-usual was 2073 euros per worker. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed participatory RTW program was more effective but also more costly than usual care. The program enhanced work resumption and generated a net socioeconomic benefit. Hence, implementation of the participatory RTW program may have potential to achieve a sustainable contribution of vulnerable workers to the labor force.",2012-01-09571,22854773,Scand J Work Environ Health,Sylvia J Vermeulen,2013,39 / 1,,No,22854773,"Sylvia J Vermeulen; Martijn W Heymans; Johannes R Anema; Antonius J M Schellart; Willem van Mechelen; Allard J van der Beek; Economic evaluation of a participatory return-to-work intervention for temporary agency and unemployed workers sick-listed due to musculoskeletal disorders, Scand J Work Environ Health, 2013 Jan; 39(1):0355-3140",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Participatory return-to-work (RTW) vs. Usual care,Not Stated,64 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,46540,Euro,2008,82381.94
10118,The cost-effectiveness of single-row compared with double-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair,"Interest in double-row techniques for arthroscopic rotator cuff repair has increased over the last several years, presumably because of a combination of literature demonstrating superior biomechanical characteristics and recent improvements in instrumentation and technique. As a result of the increasing focus on value-based health-care delivery, orthopaedic surgeons must understand the cost implications of this practice. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of double-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair compared with traditional single-row repair.A decision-analytic model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of double-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair compared with single-row repair on the basis of the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. Two cohorts of patients (one with a tear of <3 cm and the other with a tear of =3 cm) were evaluated. Probabilities for retear and persistent symptoms, health utilities for the particular health states, and the direct costs for rotator cuff repair were derived from the orthopaedic literature and institutional data.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for double-row compared with single-row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair was $571,500 for rotator cuff tears of <3 cm and $460,200 for rotator cuff tears of =3 cm. The rate of radiographic or symptomatic retear alone did not influence cost-effectiveness results. If the increase in the cost of double-row repair was less than $287 for small or moderate tears and less than $352 for large or massive tears compared with the cost of single-row repair, then double-row repair would represent a cost-effective surgical alternative.On the basis of currently available data, double-row rotator cuff repair is not cost-effective for any size rotator cuff tears. However, variability in the values for costs and probability of retear can have a profound effect on the results of the model and may create an environment in which double-row repair becomes the more cost-effective surgical option.

10125,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination for adults in Belgium,"Hepatitis A vaccination targeting adults (or adult risk-groups like e.g. travellers, health care workers, soldiers or teachers) could be considered an alternative to a universal infant or adolescent vaccination program in low endemic countries. We estimated the current disease burden of hepatitis A in Belgium, and evaluated whether adult vaccination is cost-effective. We used a Markov cohort model to simulate the costs and effects of (1) vaccination of adults and (2) serological screening of adults and vaccination of susceptibles and compared these with the current situation. The results indicated that these expanded vaccination strategies are not cost-effective in the epidemiological circumstances of a typical low-endemic western country.

This study aimed to quantify the clinical and economic impacts of poor adherence and to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of improving patient adherence by using hypothetical behavioral interventions.A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was adapted to the Irish setting to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes (fractures and quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) for three adherence scenarios: no treatment, real-world adherence, and full adherence over 3 years.

10135,Cost-effectiveness of expanded newborn screening in Texas,"Texas House Bill 790 resulted in the expansion of the newborn screening panel from 7 disorders to 27 disorders. Implementation of this change began in 2007. The objective of this study was to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the expanded newborn screening program compared with the previous standard screening in Texas.A Markov model (for a hypothetical cohort of Texas births in 2007) was constructed to compare lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between the expanded newborn screening and preexpansion newborn screening. Estimates of costs, probabilities of sequelae, and utilities for disorder categories were obtained from a combination of Texas statistics, the literature, and expert opinion. A baseline discount rate of 3% was used for both costs and QALYs, with a range of 0% to 5%. Analyses were conducted from a payer's perspective, and so only direct medical cost estimates were included.The lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for expanded versus preexpansion screening was about $11,560 per QALY. The results remained robust to both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Expanded newborn screening does result in additional expenses to the payer, but it also improves patient outcomes by preventing avoidable morbidity and mortality. The screened population benefits from greater QALYs as compared with the unscreened population. Overall, expanded newborn screening in Texas was estimated to be a cost-effective option as compared with unexpanded newborn screening.",2012-01-09590,22867769,Value Health,Simrandeep K Tiwana,2012,15 / 5,613-21,Yes,22867769,"Simrandeep K Tiwana; Karen L Rascati; Haesuk Park; Cost-effectiveness of expanded newborn screening in Texas, Value Health, ; 15(5):1098-3015; 613-21",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Expanded newborn screening vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,11560,United States,2007,14429.57

Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from published data and expert opinion. Vaccine efficacy was obtained from each vaccine's respective clinical trials. Price-parity and lifelong protection was assumed for both vaccines. The number of CIN lesions, CC cases, CC deaths and genital wart (GW) cases, and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated. Costs and outcomes (discounted at 3% and 1.5%, respectively) were compared from a payer's perspective.The model estimated that the BV led to an additional, undiscounted, 11,484 CIN1, 1,779 (+34.3% vs. QV) CIN2/3, 188 (+29.0% vs. QV) CC, and 69 (+29.0% vs. QV) CC deaths prevented compared with the QV, while the QV prevented 4,150 GW (+71%). This resulted in an additional 768 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and 11.6 million new Taiwan dollars costs saved for the BV versus the QV after discounting.Both vaccines have a different epidemiological impact with an increased number of CC-related lesions potentially prevented for the BV because of additional cross-protection.

10137,Cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented pump therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes in the United States,"A recent randomized trial demonstrated significant reductions in hemoglobin A(1c) levels with sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAPT) compared with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) in type 1 diabetes. We analyzed resource use in the trial and estimated the long-term cost-effectiveness of SAPT from the perspective of the US health care system.We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis combining estimates from the trial and the literature to populate the previously validated Center for Outcomes Research (CORE) Diabetes Model. Results represent the use of 3-day sensors, as in the trial, and 6-day sensors, approved in most markets but not yet approved in the United States.Within-trial hospital days, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Assuming 65% use of 3-day sensors, treatment-related costs in year 1 were an estimated $10,760 for SAPT and $5072 for MDI.

10138,Cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented pump therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes in the United States,"A recent randomized trial demonstrated significant reductions in hemoglobin A(1c) levels with sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAPT) compared with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) in type 1 diabetes. We analyzed resource use in the trial and estimated the long-term cost-effectiveness of SAPT from the perspective of the US health care system.We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis combining estimates from the trial and the literature to populate the previously validated Center for Outcomes Research (CORE) Diabetes Model. Results represent the use of 3-day sensors, as in the trial, and 6-day sensors, approved in most markets but not yet approved in the United States.Within-trial hospital days, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits did not differ significantly between the treatment groups. Assuming 65% use of 3-day sensors, treatment-related costs in year 1 were an estimated $10,760 for SAPT and $5072 for MDI. Discounted lifetime estimates were $253,493 in direct medical costs and 10.794 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for SAPT and $167,170 in direct medical costs and 10.418 QALYs for MDI.

10139,Bendamustine versus chlorambucil for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in England and Wales: a cost-utility analysis,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bendamustine compared with chlorambucil as first-line treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who would be considered unsuitable for treatment with fludarabine combination chemotherapy regimens.A semi-Markov approach was used to estimate time in each health state. The model was parameterized primarily by using data from a phase III randomized, open-label trial comparing bendamustine with chlorambucil. It captured the increased progression-free survival and improved response rates with bendamustine, and the cost and quality of life impacts of postprogression treatments. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales. A lifetime (35-year) time horizon was used. Deterministic sensitivity analyses, probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analyses in older patients and patients with poor performance status were carried out.The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was ? 11,960 per quality-adjusted life-year. None of the deterministic sensitivity analyses increased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio by more than ? 2000. Subgroup analyses showed that bendamustine remained cost-effective across different patient groups. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at the ? 20,000 threshold, bendamustine has a 90% probability of being cost-effective.Bendamustine represents good value for first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are unsuitable for treatment with fludarabine combination chemotherapy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is below the thresholds commonly applied in England and Wales (? 20,000-? 30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year).",2012-01-09595,22867787,Value Health,Beth Woods,2012,15 / 5,759-70,Yes,22867787,"Beth Woods; Neil Hawkins; William Dunlop; Alison O'Toole; Steve Bramham-Jones; Bendamustine versus chlorambucil for the first-line treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in England and Wales: a cost-utility analysis, Value Health, ; 15(5):1098-3015; 759-70",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bendamustine vs. Chlorambucil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.50,3.50,11960,United Kingdom,2009,20890.97

10160,"Cost-effectiveness of everolimus vs sunitinib in treating patients with advanced, progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in the United States","Abstract Background: Everolimus (Afinitor) and sunitinib (Sutent) were recently approved to treat patients with advanced, progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs). (Afinitor is a registered trademark of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA; Sutent is a registered trademark of Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA.) This analysis examined the projected cost-effectiveness of everolimus vs sunitinib in this setting from a US payer perspective. Methods: A semi-Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of patients with advanced, progressive pNET and to estimate the cost per life-year gained (LYG) and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained when treating with everolimus vs sunitinib. Efficacy data were based on a weight-adjusted indirect comparison of the agents using phase 3 trial data. Model health states included: stable disease with no adverse events, stable disease with adverse events, disease progression, and death. Therapy costs were based on wholesale acquisition cost. Other costs such as physician visits, tests, hospitalizations, and adverse event costs were obtained from literature and/or primary research. Utility inputs were based on primary research. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the model's robustness. Results: In the base-case analysis, everolimus was associated with an incremental 0.448 LYG (0.304 QALYs) at an incremental cost of $12,673, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $28,281/LYG ($41,702/QALY gained). The ICER fell within the cost per QALY range for many widely used oncology drugs. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, overall, there is a trend that everolimus is cost-effective compared to sunitinib in this setting. Limitations: Results of the indirect analysis were not statistically significant (p?>?0.05). Assumptions that treatment patterns are the same across therapies may not represent real-world practice. Conclusions: While the analysis is limited by its reliance on an indirect comparison of two phase 3 studies, everolimus is expected to be cost-effective relative to sunitinib in advanced, progressive pNET.",2012-01-09611,22881362,J Med Econ,Roman Casciano,2012,15Suppl1 /,55-64,Yes,22881362,"Roman Casciano; Maruit Chulikavit; Allison Perrin; Zhimei Liu; Xufang Wang; Louis P Garrison; Cost-effectiveness of everolimus vs sunitinib in treating patients with advanced, progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in the United States, J Med Econ, ; 15Suppl1():1369-6998; 55-64",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Everolimus (10mg daily) vs. Sunitinib (37.5mg daily),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,34815.93,United States,2011,40058.62
10161,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding versus standard medical management in obese patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK,"AIM: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) versus standard medical management (SMM) in obese patients with type 2 diabetes from a UK healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A validated computer model of diabetes was used to project outcomes reported from a randomized clinical trial of LAGB versus SMM in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Two-year follow-up data from the trial were projected over a 40-year time horizon and cost-effectiveness was assessed from the perspective of the National Health Service. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually and all costs were reported in 2010 pounds sterling. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: LAGB was associated with benefits in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, body mass index and serum lipid concentrations, which led to significant increases in discounted life expectancy (an increase of 0.64 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (an increase of 0.92 quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) and reduced incidence of diabetes complications relative to SMM. Treatment costs in the LAGB arm increased by 4552 Great British Pounds (GBP), but this was partially offset by cost savings resulting from a reduction in the incidence of all modelled diabetes complications. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 3602 per QALY in the base case fell well below commonly quoted willingness-to-pay thresholds in the UK setting. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of data from a recent randomized controlled trial, LAGB is likely to be considered cost-effective from the healthcare payer perspective when compared with SMM of obesity in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK setting.",2012-01-09613,22882321,Diabetes Obes Metab,R F Pollock,2013,15 / 2,,No,22882321,"R F Pollock; G Muduma; W J Valentine; Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding versus standard medical management in obese patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK, Diabetes Obes Metab, 2013 Feb; 15(2):1462-8902",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) vs. Standard medical management (SMM),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.50,3.50,3602,United Kingdom,2010,6600.02

A cost-effectiveness model was constructed and used for analysis. Balloon kyphoplasty may be cost-effective compared to relevant alternatives. INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) compared to percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and nonsurgical management (NSM) in the UK. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was developed to evaluate treatment with BKP, NSM and PVP in patients with symptomatic OVCF. Data on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with acute OVCF were derived from the FREE and VERTOS II randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and normalised to the NSM arm in the FREE trial. Estimated differences in mortality among the treatments and costs for NSM were obtained from the literature whereas procedure costs for BKP and PVP were obtained from three National Health Service hospitals. It was assumed that BKP and PVP reduced hospital length of stay by 6 days compared to NSM. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at Great Britain Pound Sterling (GBP) 2,706 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and GBP 15,982 per QALY compared to NSM and PVP, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of BKP vs. NSM was robust when mortality and HRQoL benefits with BKP were varied. The cost-effectiveness of BKP compared to PVP was particularly sensitive to changes in the mortality benefit. CONCLUSION: BKP may be a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of patients hospitalised with acute OVCF in the UK compared to NSM and PVP.

10170,Cost effectiveness of concurrent gemcitabine and cisplatin with radiation followed by adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with stages IIB to IVA carcinoma of the cervix,"A recent phase III trial reported gemcitabine with cisplatin chemoradiation followed by 2 cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin (G) significantly improved progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to standard cisplatin chemoradiation (C) for locally advanced cervix cancer. We evaluate the cost effectiveness (CE) of these treatment regimens.A modified Markov model was constructed comparing CE between treatment arms using the published trial's five-year OS and treatment-related toxicity rates. Quality of life (QOL) utility scores during treatment were obtained from published literature and modeled for sensitivity analysis. Cost data was obtained from Medicare reimbursement figures and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. One-way sensitivity analyses assessed variations in cost and adverse events.Mean cost was $41,330 (US$) for C versus $60,974 for G. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for G compared to C was $33,080 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In sensitivity analyses (SA), the ICER increased to common willingness-to-pay thresholds of 50 K and 100 K when QOL utility scores during G active treatment declined to 0.64 and 0.53 (baseline 0.76), respectively. The model was insensitive to changes in adverse event rates, costs of treatment, or adverse event hospitalization costs.Gemcitabine with cisplatin chemoradiation followed by 2 cycles of adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin is a cost effective treatment for locally advanced cervix cancer compared to standard cisplatin chemoradiation. Common willingness to pay thresholds are exceeded during sensitivity analyses with realistic declines in QOL.

10171,Scenario drafting to anticipate future developments in technology assessment,"Health Technology Assessment (HTA) information, and in particular cost-effectiveness data is needed to guide decisions, preferably already in early stages of technological development. However, at that moment there is usually a high degree of uncertainty, because evidence is limited and different development paths are still possible. We developed a multi-parameter framework to assess dynamic aspects of a technology -still in development-, by means of scenario drafting to determine the effects, costs and cost-effectiveness of possible future diffusion patterns. Secondly, we explored the value of this method on the case of the clinical implementation of the 70-gene signature for breast cancer, a gene expression profile for selecting patients who will benefit most from chemotherapy.To incorporate process-uncertainty, ten possible scenarios regarding the introduction of the 70-gene signature were drafted with European experts. Out of 5 most likely scenarios, 3 drivers of diffusion (non-compliance, technical failure, and uptake) were quantitatively integrated in a decision-analytical model. For these scenarios, the cost-effectiveness of the 70-gene signature expressed in Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) was compared to clinical guidelines, calculated from the past (2005) until the future (2020).In 2005 the ICER was ?1,9 million/quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY), meaning that the 70-gene signature was not yet cost-effective compared to the current clinical guideline. The ICER for the 70-gene signature improved over time with a range of ?1,9 million to ?26,145 in 2010 and ?1,9 million to ?11,123/QALY in 2020 depending on the separate scenario used. From 2010, the 70-gene signature should be cost-effective, based on the combined scenario. The uptake-scenario had strongest influence on the cost-effectiveness.When optimal diffusion of a technology is sought, incorporating process-uncertainty by means of scenario drafting into a decision model may reveal unanticipated developments and can demonstrate a range of possible cost-effectiveness outcomes. The effect of scenarios give additional information on the speed with cost effectiveness might be reached and thus provide a more realistic picture for policy makers, opinion leaders and manufacturers.",2012-01-09629,22894140,BMC Res Notes,Valesca P Ret?l,2012,5 /,442,No,22894140,"Valesca P Ret?l; Manuela A Joore; Sabine C Linn; Emiel J T Rutgers; Wim H van Harten; Scenario drafting to anticipate future developments in technology assessment, BMC Res Notes, ; 5():1756-0500; 442",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,70 gene signature vs. Current clinical guidelines,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,4.00,1.50,1940000,Euro,2005,3200416.73
10172,Cost-effectiveness analysis of timely dialysis referral after renal transplant failure in Spain,"A cost-effectiveness analysis of timely dialysis referral after renal transplant failure was undertaken from the perspective of the Public Administration. The current Spanish situation, where all the patients undergoing graft function loss are referred back to dialysis in a late manner, was compared to an ideal scenario where all the patients are timely referred.A Markov model was developed in which six health states were defined: hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, kidney transplantation, late referral hemodialysis, late referral peritoneal dialysis and death. The model carried out a simulation of the progression of renal disease for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients aged 40, who were observed in a lifetime temporal horizon of 45?years. In depth sensitivity analyses were performed in order to ensure the robustness of the results obtained.Considering a discount rate of 3?%, timely referral showed an incremental cost of 211 ?, compared to late referral. This cost increase was however a consequence of the incremental survival observed. The incremental effectiveness was 0.0087 quality-adjusted life years (QALY). When comparing both scenarios, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 24,390 ?/QALY was obtained, meaning that timely dialysis referral might be an efficient alternative if a willingness-to-pay threshold of 45,000 ?/QALY is considered. This result proved to be independent of the proportion of late referral patients observed. The acceptance probability of timely referral was 61.90?%, while late referral was acceptable in 38.10?% of the simulations. If we however restrict the analysis to those situations not involving any loss of effectiveness, the acceptance probability of timely referral was 70.10?%, increasing twofold that of late referral (29.90?%).Timely dialysis referral after graft function loss might be an efficient alternative in Spain, improving both patients' survival rates and health-related quality of life at an affordable cost.

10173,Dabigatran versus rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation in Canada. Comparative efficacy and cost-effectiveness,"Canadian patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in whom anticoagulation is appropriate have two new choices for anticoagulation for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism--dabigatran etexilate (dabigatran) and rivaroxaban. Based on the RE-LY and ROCKET AF trial results, we investigated the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran (twice daily dosing of 150 mg or 110 mg based on patient age) versus rivaroxaban from a Canadian payer perspective. A formal indirect treatment comparison (ITC) of dabigatran versus rivaroxaban was performed, using dabigatran clinical event rates from RE-LY for the safety-on-treatment population, adjusted to the ROCKET AF population. A previously described Markov model was modified to simulate anticoagulation treatment using ITC results as inputs. Model outputs included total costs, event rates, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The ITC found when compared to rivaroxaban, dabigatran had a lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) (relative risk [RR] = 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.21 - 0.67) and stroke (RR = 0.62; 95%CI 0.45-0.87). Over a lifetime horizon, the model found dabigatran-treated patients experienced fewer ICHs (0.33 dabigatran vs. 0.71 rivaroxaban) and ischaemic strokes (3.40 vs. 3.96) per 100 patient-years, and accrued more QALYs (6.17 vs. 6.01). Dabigatran-treated patients had lower acute care and long-term follow-up costs per patient ($52,314 vs. $53,638) which more than offset differences in drug costs ($7,299 vs. $6,128). In probabilistic analysis, dabigatran had high probability of being the most cost-effective therapy at common thresholds of willingness-to-pay (93% at a $20,000/QALY threshold). This study found dabigatran is economically dominant versus rivaroxaban for prevention of stroke and systemic embolism among Canadian AF patients.",2012-01-09638,22898892,Thromb Haemost,Anuraag R Kansal,2012,108 / 4,672-82,No,22898892,"Anuraag R Kansal; Michael Sharma; Carole Bradley-Kennedy; Andreas Clemens; Brigitta U Monz; Siyang Peng; Neil Roskell; Sonja V Sorensen; Dabigatran versus rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation in Canada.

10174,Cost-effectiveness of tenofovir instead of zidovudine for use in first-line antiretroviral therapy in settings without virological monitoring,"The most recent World Health Organization (WHO) antiretroviral treatment guidelines recommend the inclusion of zidovudine (ZDV) or tenofovir (TDF) in first-line therapy. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with emphasis on emerging patterns of drug resistance upon treatment failure and their impact on second-line therapy.We used a stochastic simulation of a generalized HIV-1 epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa to compare two strategies for first-line combination antiretroviral treatment including lamivudine, nevirapine and either ZDV or TDF. Model input parameters were derived from literature and, for the simulation of resistance pathways, estimated from drug resistance data obtained after first-line treatment failure in settings without virological monitoring. Treatment failure and cost effectiveness were determined based on WHO definitions. Two scenarios with optimistic (no emergence; base) and pessimistic (extensive emergence) assumptions regarding occurrence of multidrug resistance patterns were tested.In the base scenario, cumulative proportions of treatment failure according to WHO criteria were higher among first-line ZDV users (median after six years 36% [95% simulation interval 32%; 39%]) compared with first-line TDF users (31% [29%; 33%]). Consequently, a higher proportion initiated second-line therapy (including lamivudine, boosted protease inhibitors and either ZDV or TDF) in the first-line ZDV user group 34% [31%; 37%] relative to first-line TDF users (30% [27%; 32%]). At the time of second-line initiation, a higher proportion (16%) of first-line ZDV users harboured TDF-resistant HIV compared with ZDV-resistant viruses among first-line TDF users (0% and 6% in base and pessimistic scenarios, respectively). In the base scenario, the incremental cost effectiveness ratio with respect to quality adjusted life years (QALY) was US$83 when TDF instead of ZDV was used in first-line therapy (pessimistic scenario: US$ 315), which was below the WHO threshold for high cost effectiveness (US$ 2154).Using TDF instead of ZDV in first-line treatment in resource-limited settings is very cost-effective and likely to better preserve future treatment options in absence of virological monitoring.",2012-01-09647,22905175,PLoS One,Viktor von Wyl,2012,7 / 8,e42834,No,22905175,"Viktor von Wyl; Valentina Cambiano; Michael R Jordan; Silvia Bertagnolio; Alec Miners; Deenan Pillay; Jens Lundgren; Andrew N Phillips; Cost-effectiveness of tenofovir instead of zidovudine for use in first-line antiretroviral therapy in settings without virological monitoring, PLoS One , ; 7(8):1932-6203; e42834",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Zidovudine (ZDV) as first-line antiretroviral therapy without virological monitoring vs. Tenofovir (TDF),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,83,United States,2010,98.51
10175,Long-term cost-effectiveness model of interferon beta-1b in the early treatment of multiple sclerosis in the United States,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially debilitating autoimmune disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Disease-modifying therapies have been shown to slow disease progression but were not believed to prolong the survival of patients with MS. The recent 21-Year Long-Term Follow-Up (21Y-LTF) study found a significant survival advantage for patients receiving early treatment with interferon beta (IFN?)-1b compared with placebo (no early treatment).The aim of this study was to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses estimating the long-term benefit of early treatment with IFN?-1b among MS patients from a US societal perspective.A Markov model was developed to simulate the experience of patients with MS from the 21Y-LTF study over a lifetime. Patients were randomized to receive either IFN?-1b or placebo for up to 5 years and then receive a variety of MS treatments (including no treatment) thereafter. Survival data reported from the 21Y-LTF study were incorporated into the model. The model assumes that patients' MS was managed in similar ways for both groups during the uncontrolled phase of the 21Y-LTF study (ie, survival difference between the 2 groups is the result of early use of IFN?-1b). Health outcomes were life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs included treatments, direct disease management, informal care, and lost productivities and were reported in 2011 US dollars.In the modeled placebo group, the median age at death was predicted to be 63.7 years, and the median survival time from disease onset was 36.7 years.

10176,Cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in the MADIT-CRT trial,"BACKGROUND: The Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial-Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (MADIT-CRT) trial demonstrated that cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) when added to the implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) reduces risk of heart failure or death in minimally symptomatic patients with reduced cardiac ejection fraction and wide QRS complex. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 4-year cost-effectiveness of CRT-ICD compared to ICD alone using MADIT-CRT data. RESEARCH DESIGN: Patients enrolled in the trial were randomized to implantation of either ICD or CRT-ICD in a 2:3 ratio, with up to 4-year follow-up period. Cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted, and sensitivity analyses by age, gender, and left bundle branch block (LBBB) conduction pattern were performed. SUBJECTS: A total of 1,271 patients with ICD or CRT-ICD (US centers only) who reported healthcare utilization and health-related quality of life data. MEASURES: We used the EQ-5D (US weights) to assess patient HRQOL and translated utilization data to costs using national Medicare reimbursement rates. RESULTS: Average 4-year healthcare expenditures in CRT-ICD patients were higher than costs of ICD patients ($62,600 vs 57,050, P = 0.015), mainly due to the device and implant-related costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CRT-ICD compared to ICD was $58,330/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved.

10178,Economic effects of interventions to reduce obesity in Israel,"Obesity is a major risk factor for many diseases. The paper calculates the economic impact and the cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) resulting from the adoption of eight interventions comprising the clinical and part of the community components of the National Prevention and Health Promotion Program (NPHPP) of the Israeli Ministry of Health (MOH) which represents the obesity control implementation arm of the MOH Healthy Israel 2020 Initiative.Health care costs per person were calculated by body mass index (BMI) by applying Israeli cost data to aggregated results from international studies. These were applied to BMI changes from eight intervention programmes in order to calculate reductions in direct treatment costs. Indirect cost savings were also estimated as were additional costs due to increased longevity of program participants. Data on costs and QALYs gained from Israeli and International dietary interventions were combined to provide cost-utility estimates of an intervention program to reduce obesity in Israel over a range of recidivism rates.On average, persons who were overweight (25 = BMI < 30)had health care costs that were 12.2% above the average health care costs of persons with normal or sub-normal weight to height ratios (BMI < 25). This differential in costs rose to 31.4% and 73.0% for obese and severely obese persons, respectively.For overweight (25 = BMI < 30) and obese persons (30 = BMI < 40), costs per person for the interventions (including the screening overhead) ranged from 35 NIS for a community intervention to 860 NIS, reflecting the intensity of the clinical setting intervention and the unit costs of the professionals carrying out the intervention [e.g., dietician]. Expected average BMI decreases ranged from 0.05 to 0.90. Higher intervention costs and larger BMI decreases characterized the two clinical lifestyle interventions for the severely obese (BMI = 40).A program directed at the entire Israeli population aged 20 and over, using a variety of eight different interventions would cost 2.07 billion NIS overall. In the baseline scenario (with an assumed recidivism rate of 50% per annum), approximately 620,000,000 NIS would be recouped in the form of decreased treatment costs and indirect costs, increased productivity and decreased absenteeism. After discounting the 89,000,000 NIS additional health costs attributable to these extra life years, it is estimated that the total net costs to society would be 1.55 billion NIS. This total net cost was relatively stable to increases in the program's recidivism rates, but highly sensitive to reductions in recidivism rates.Under baseline assumptions, implementation of the cluster of interventions would save 32,671 discounted QALYs at a cost of only 47,559 NIS per QALY, less than half of the Israeli per capita GNP (104,000 NIS). Thus implementation of these components of the NPHPP should be considered very cost-effective.Despite the large costs of such a large national program to control obesity, cost-utility analysis strongly supports its introduction.",2012-01-09656,22913803,Isr J Health Policy Res,Gary M Ginsberg,2012,1 / 1,17,No,22913803,"Gary M Ginsberg; Elliot Rosenberg; Economic effects of interventions to reduce obesity in Israel, Isr J Health Policy Res, ; 1(1):2045-4015; 17",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Office based community and dietary interventions vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,47559,Israel,2010,15878.78

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost effectiveness of two weight loss programmes of 1-year duration, either standard care (SC) as defined by national guidelines, or a commercial provider (Weight Watchers) (CP). DESIGN: This analysis was based on a randomised controlled trial of 772 adults (87% female; age 47.4+/-12.9 years; body mass index 31.4+/-2.6 kg m(-2)) recruited by health professionals in primary care in Australia, United Kingdom and Germany. Both a health sector and societal perspective were adopted to calculate the cost per kilogram of weight loss and the ICER, expressed as the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: The cost per kilogram of weight loss was USD122, 90 and 180 for the CP in Australia, the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively. For SC the cost was USD138, 151 and 133, respectively. From a health-sector perspective, the ICER for the CP relative to SC was USD18 266, 12 100 and 40 933 for Australia, the United Kingdom and Germany, respectively.

10184,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination in adults with diagnosed diabetes,"OBJECTIVE To examine the cost-effectiveness of a hepatitis B vaccination program for unvaccinated adults with diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We used a cost-effectiveness simulation model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating adults 20-59 years of age with diagnosed diabetes not previously vaccinated for or infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV). The model estimated acute and chronic HBV infections, complications, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Data sources included surveillance data, epidemiological studies, and vaccine prices. RESULTS With a 10% uptake rate, the intervention will vaccinate 528,047 people and prevent 4,271 acute and 256 chronic hepatitis B infections. Net health care costs will increase by $91.4 million, and 1,218 QALYs will be gained, producing a cost-effectiveness ratio of $75,094 per QALY gained. Results are most sensitive to age, the discount rate, the hepatitis B incidence ratio for people with diabetes, and hepatitis B infection rates. Cost-effectiveness ratios rise with age at vaccination; an alternative intervention that vaccinates adults with diabetes 60 years of age or older had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $2.7 million per QALY. CONCLUSIONS Hepatitis B vaccination for adults with diabetes 20-59 years of age is modestly cost-effective. Vaccinating older adults with diabetes is not cost-effective. The study did not consider hepatitis outbreak investigation costs, and limited information exists on hepatitis progression among older adults with diabetes. Partly based on these results, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recently recommended hepatitis B vaccination for people 20-59 years of age with diagnosed diabetes.",2012-01-09677,22933435,Diabetes Care,Thomas J Hoerger,2013,36 / 1,,No,22933435,"Thomas J Hoerger; Sarah Schillie; John S Wittenborn; Christina L Bradley; Fangjun Zhou; Kathy Byrd; Trudy V Murphy; Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination in adults with diagnosed diabetes, Diabetes Care, 2013 Jan; 36(1):0149-5992",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vaccination with heptatitis B recombinant vaccine (10% uptake) vs. None,Not Stated,59 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,75094,United States,2010,89129.18

We sought to define the cost-effectiveness of CTA using a Markov model.We studied outcomes and costs of CTA and non-CTA strategies in a modeled cohort of 10 000 patients undergoing redo coronary artery bypass grafting. Rates of PSS implementation were anticipated to follow identification of risk by CTA. Transitions, costs, and utilities were informed by our experience and the literature. Sensitivity analyses included testing a range of costs of CTA and PSS on model outcome. In the reference case, cost and quality-adjusted life years accrued with the use of CTA ($74 869, 4.63 quality-adjusted life-years) were slightly higher than nonuse ($73 471, 4.59 quality-adjusted life-years), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $34 950/quality-adjusted life-years. Cost of PSS (equipment and operating time) was the most significant determinant of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. In the reference case (cost of CTA ?$300), identification and avoidance of potential procedural difficulties with CTA rendered it cost-effective if the cost of PSS was <$12 000. Across a range of CTA costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was not materially influenced by outcomes across a broad range of imputed values.The cost of CTA appears justified in the setting of isolated reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting, because it aids in appropriate selection of PSS. The cost-effectiveness of this imaging seems more influenced by the costs of subsequent PSS than by the cost of CTA.",2012-01-09678,22933521,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,Hemal Gada,2012,5 / 5,705-10,No,22933521,"Hemal Gada; Milind Y Desai; Thomas H Marwick; Cost-effectiveness of computed tomographic angiography before reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting: a decision-analytic model, Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, Sep/1/2012; 5(5):1941-7705; 705-10",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Reporative coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) preceded by thoracic multidetector computed tomographic angiography (CTA) vs. Reporative CABG,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,34950,United States,2012,39397.56

Methods: A lifetime Markov model incorporated the probabilities of experiencing treatment-related long-term toxicity or death. Toxicity probabilities were derived from published sources using meta-analytical techniques. Utilities and costs in the model were obtained from publicly available secondary sources. The model calculated quality-adjusted life expectancy and expected lifetime cost per patient, and derived ratios of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained between treatments. Analyses were conducted from both payer and societal perspectives. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Compared to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and proton beam therapy (PT), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) was less costly and resulted in more QALYs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the conclusions in the base-case scenario were robust with respect to variations in toxicity and cost parameters consistent with available evidence. At a threshold of $50,000/QALY, SBRT was cost-effective in 75% and 94% of probabilistic simulations compared to IMRT and PT, respectively, from a payer perspective. From a societal perspective, SBRT was cost-effective in 75% and 96% of simulations compared to IMRT and PT, respectively, at a threshold of $50,000/QALY. In threshold analyses, SBRT was less expensive with better outcomes compared to IMRT at toxicity rates 23% greater than the SBRT base-case rates.

10192,Switching to sertraline or venlafaxine after failure of SSRIs treatment in major depressive disorder: an economic evaluation of the STAR*D trial,"Switching to another antidepressant is one of the alternative treatment strategies employed in major depressive disorder (MDD) patients who have no remission despite an adequate trial of an antidepressant. The aim of the present study was to present an economic evaluation of sertraline compared with venlafaxine after unsuccessful treatment for depression with citalopram.An economic model was constructed in line with the design of the sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D) study. MDD patients who did not have a remission with or who had an intolerance to citalopram were randomly assigned to be switched to either sertraline or venlafaxine. Patients who had no remission at the end of the switching treatment phase still continued the antidepressants and received an adjunctive treatment with aripiprazole. The event probabilities were used to derive the transitional probabilities use in the model. The primary model outcome was remission of symptoms and the secondary outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICEs) were estimated for the costs per unit of effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses were done to assess the effects of model assumptions.The total direct costs per remission were 27,830 Baht for sertraline and 30,147 Baht for venlafaxine. Sertraline had lower total costs per QALY than venlafaxine (34,788 Baht vs. 37,683 Baht). The more cost-effectiveness of sertraline resulted in 7.68% of cost saving. The incremental cost of venlafaxine compared with sertraline was 2,316 Baht per remission gained and 2895 Baht per QALY gained. By varying the remission rate of venlafaxine from 20% to 40%, the sensitivity analysis results in a decrease in total costs of venlafaxine from 31,926 Baht to 24,808 Baht. In addition, incremental cost per remission gained changed from 4096 Baht in favour of sertraline to 3023 Baht in favour of venlafaxine. Similarly, incremental cost per QALY gained changedfrom in favour of sertraline to in favour of venlafaxine.Based on the STAR*D trial, the results of the economic study indicate that a switch to sertraline is a cost-effectiveness treatment option compared with a switch to venlafaxine in MDD patients who have no remission or cannot tolerate citalopram.",2012-01-09680,22934442,J Med Assoc Thai,Thawatchai Leelahanaj,2012,95Suppl5 /,S29-37,No,22934442,"Thawatchai Leelahanaj; Switching to sertraline or venlafaxine after failure of SSRIs treatment in major depressive disorder: an economic evaluation of the STAR*D trial, J Med Assoc Thai, ; 95Suppl5():0125-2208; S29-37",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sertraline at maximal daily dose of 200 mg up to 14 weeks vs. Extended release of venlafaxine at maximal daily dose of 375 mg up to 14 weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,14 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-131962.88,Thailand,2009,-4642.7
10193,Cost-effectiveness analysis of repeat fine-needle aspiration for thyroid biopsies read as atypia of undetermined significance,"The 2007 National Cancer Institute (NCI) conference on Thyroid Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) introduced the category atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS). Repeat FNA in 3 to 6 months was recommended for low-risk patients. Compliance with these recommendations has been suboptimal. We hypothesized that repeat FNA would be more effective than diagnostic lobectomy, with decreased costs and improved rates of cancer detection.Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed in which we compared diagnostic lobectomy with repeat FNA. A Markov model was developed. Outcomes and probabilities were identified from literature review. Third-party payer costs were estimated in 2010 US dollars. Outcomes were weighted by use of the quality-of-life utility factors, yielding quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analysis were used to examine the uncertainty of probability, cost, and utility estimates.The diagnostic lobectomy strategy cost $8,057 and produced 23.99 QALYs. Repeat FNA cost $2,462 and produced 24.05 QALYs. Repeat FNA was dominant until the cost of FNA increased to $6,091. Dominance of the repeat FNA strategy was not sensitive to the cost of operation or the complication rate.The NCI recommendations for repeat FNA regarding follow-up of AUS/FLUS results are cost-effective. Improving compliance with these guidelines should lead to less overall costs, greater quality of life, and fewer unnecessary operations.",2012-01-09688,22938902,Surgery,Michael Heller,2012,152 / 3,423-30,No,22938902,"Michael Heller; Kyle Zanocco; Sara Zydowicz; Dina Elaraj; Ritu Nayar; Cord Sturgeon; Cost-effectiveness analysis of repeat fine-needle aspiration for thyroid biopsies read as atypia of undetermined significance, Surgery, ; 152(3):0039-6060; 423-30",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Repeat fine-needle aspiration (FNA) vs. Diagnostic thyroid lobectomy,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,-97286.95,United States,2010,-115470.03

We assumed that lamivudine reduced perinatal transmission by 62%.Our Markov model demonstrated that lamivudine administration is the dominant strategy. For every 1000 infected pregnant women treated with lamivudine, $337,000 is saved and 314 quality-adjusted life-years are gained. For every 1000 pregnancies with maternal hepatitis B, lamivudine prevents 21 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma and 5 liver transplants in the offspring.

10195,Prolonged postoperative venous thrombo-embolism prophylaxis is cost-effective in advanced ovarian cancer patients,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of prolonged prophylaxis with enoxaparin in high-risk surgical patients with ovarian cancer. In addition, we sought to quantify the impact of prolonged prophylaxis (PP) on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), its related complications, and overall patient survival.A Markov decision analytic model was used to estimate the costs, resource allocation and outcomes associated with the prolonged use of enoxaparin, for a total of four weeks after surgery, in patients undergoing primary debulking surgery for stage IIIC ovarian cancer. We estimated incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) at one and five year intervals; the estimated reduction in VTE episodes, bleeding episodes, and survival at the five year interval for a simulated cohort of 10,000 women.The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for prolonged prophylaxis (PP) was $5236/QALY and $-1462/QALY at one and five years respectively. For patients receiving PP, the model estimated a 12% reduction in the clinically evident VTE episodes and a higher five-year survival (31.61% vs. 29.96%; p<0.0001). Resource allocation analysis reveals that 95% of initial investment cost of prolonged enoxaparin is recovered within one year.In ovarian cancer patients undergoing open abdominal surgery, prolonged VTE prophylaxis not only improves patient outcomes, but is also a cost saving strategy when modeled over five years.

10196,Development of an economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of hawthorn extract as an adjunct treatment for heart failure in Australia,"An economic model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of hawthorn extract as an adjunctive treatment for heart failure in Australia.A Markov model of chronic heart failure was developed to compare the costs and outcomes of standard treatment and standard treatment with hawthorn extract. Health states were defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification system and death. For any given cycle, patients could remain in the same NYHA class, experience an improvement or deterioration in NYHA class, be hospitalised or die. Model inputs were derived from the published medical literature, and the output was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and the expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI) were conducted to establish the value of further research and the ideal target for such research.Hawthorn extract increased costs by $1866.78 and resulted in a gain of 0.02 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $85 160.33 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that at a threshold of $40 000 the new treatment had a 0.29 probability of being cost-effective. The average incremental net monetary benefit (NMB) was -$1791.64, the average NMB for the standard treatment was $92 067.49, and for hawthorn extract $90 275.84. Additional research is potentially cost-effective if research is not proposed to cost more than $325 million.

10197,Cost-effectiveness analysis of stereotactic body radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy: an emerging initial radiation treatment option for organ-confined prostate cancer,"The purpose of this study is to compare the cost-effectiveness of two external beam radiation therapy techniques for treatment of low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer: stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).A Markov decision analysis model with probabilistic sensitivity analysis was designed with the various disease states of a 70-year-old patient with organ-confined prostate cancer to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two external beam radiation treatment options.The Monte Carlo simulation revealed that the mean cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for SBRT and IMRT were $22,152 and 7.9 years and $35,431 and 7.9 years, respectively. The sensitivity analysis revealed that if the SBRT cohort experienced a decrease in quality of life of 4% or a decrease in efficacy of 6%, then SBRT would no longer dominate IMRT in cost-effectiveness. In fact, with these relaxed assumptions for SBRT, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of IMRT met the societal willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY.Compared with IMRT, SBRT for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer has great potential cost savings for our health care system payers and may improve access to radiation, increase patient convenience, and boost quality of life for patients. Our model suggests that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of IMRT compared with SBRT is highly sensitive to quality-of-life outcomes, which should be adequately and comparably measured in current and future prostate SBRT studies.",2012-01-09699,22942832,J Oncol Pract,Joseph C Hodges,2012,8 / 3Suppl,e31s-7s,No,22942832,"Joseph C Hodges; Yair Lotan; Thomas P Boike; Rhonda Benton; Alyson Barrier; Robert D Timmerman; Cost-effectiveness analysis of stereotactic body radiation therapy versus intensity-modulated radiation therapy: an emerging initial radiation treatment option for organ-confined prostate cancer, J Oncol Pract, ; 8(3Suppl):1935-469X; e31s-7s",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensity-modulated radiation therapy vs. Stereotactic body radiation therapy,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2010,Not Stated

To account for endogeneity between regulation and quality, we used instrumental variables techniques. Quality was measured by staffing hours by type per case-mix adjusted day, hotel expenditures, and risk-adjusted decline in activities of daily living, high-risk pressure sores, and urinary incontinence.All states' licensing and certification offices were surveyed to obtain data about deficiencies. Secondary data included the Minimum Data Set, Medicare Cost Reports, and the Economic Freedom Index.Regulatory stringency was significantly associated with better quality for four of the seven measures studied. The cost-effectiveness for the activities-of-daily-living measure was estimated at about 72,000 in 2011/ Quality Adjusted Life Year.Quality regulations lead to better quality in nursing homes along some dimensions, but not all.

10199,A 36-month study on the cost/utility of add-on omalizumab in persistent difficult-to-treat atopic asthma in Italy,"Omalizumab is a biological treatment for difficult-to-treat allergic asthma. Its mechanism of action relies on impeding the binding of immunoglobulin E (IgE) to specific cellular receptors, thus blocking the inflammatory cascade. At present, no long-term data are available on its cost/effectiveness. The aim of this study is to assess long-term clinical outcomes and to measure the cost/utility of long-term omalizumab use in difficult-to-treat allergic asthmatics.The clinical, economic, and quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes of 36-month add-on omalizumab therapy were compared to equivalent outcomes for the year before the therapy's introduction in a cohort (n = 16) of adults with severe uncontrolled atopic asthma on chronic high-dose antiasthma treatments. The variables considered were lung function, IgE levels, health status, Asthma Control Test (ACT) score, QoL (St. George Questionnaire), general practitioner (GP) and specialist visits, number and duration of hospitalizations, emergency room admission, and pharmacological treatment (both dose and duration). Derived calculated indicators were changes in health-related QoL, total healthcare costs, and incremental cost/utility. Data from the two periods were tested for statistically significant differences according to Student's t test and p < .05 was accepted.Add-on omalizumab significantly and progressively improved asthma control and patient health-related QoL. Symptomatic drug and hospital care costs for these patients dropped significantly. A ?450 increase in overall monthly costs was observed; however, when health benefits were considered, this cost increase translated into an incremental cost/utility ratio of ?23,880 per quality-adjusted life year gained, which is quite a favorable and convenient figure in terms of the willingness to pay for health benefits in industrialized countries.The 36-month add-on omalizumab therapy persistently improved all clinical outcomes in difficult-to-treat asthmatic patients.

10200,Cost-effectiveness analysis of rosuvastatin vs generic atorvastatin in Spain,"Abstract Objective: The objective of this study was to carry out a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis of rosuvastatin compared with generic atorvastatin in the treatment of patients at high cardiovascular (CV) risk (=5% Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation [SCORE]) and patients with prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Spain. Methods: The efficacy data from the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) study were used to simulate achievement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets with different doses of rosuvastatin and generic atorvastatin for an initial period of 1 year. A Markov model was used to estimate the number of CV complications, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and healthcare costs (lipid-lowering treatment and CV events) for up to 20 years after initial treatment. The analysis was carried out from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System, with costs (in year 2010 euros) and effects being discounted at 3% per year. Results: Compared with generic atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was cost-effective (cost per QALY gained of less than ?30,000) for the primary prevention of CV events in high-risk patients in most sub-groups analyzed. In patients with prior CVD, rosuvastatin was cost-effective in all sub-groups of men and most sub-groups of women. Key limitations of this study were the need to extrapolate data from a single trial to long-term modeled outcomes and the absence of other treatment options in the analysis. Conclusions: For the treatment of dyslipidemic patients with high CV risk, rosuvastatin is more effective than generic atorvastatin in terms of survival and quality-of-life adjusted survival, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios within the range generally used in Spain, in most sub-populations defined by various combinations of CV risk factors.",2012-01-09716,22954062,J Med Econ,Vivencio Barrios,2012,15Suppl1 /,45-54,Yes,22954062,"Vivencio Barrios; Jos?
