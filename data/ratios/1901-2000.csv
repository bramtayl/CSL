1901,"Cost effectiveness of treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia: an economic model for comparison of medical, minimally invasive, and surgical therapy","PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of minimally invasive therapy relative to medical (alpha-blocker) therapy and transurethral resection (TURP) for patients with moderate to severe symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic Markov model for a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old men with moderate to severe BPH symptoms. Microwave thermotherapy was selected to represent minimally invasive treatment. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed with 25 health states using the 3 treatments, 5 short-term clinical events, and 17 possible long-term outcomes. Each health state had an associated cost and utility. Quality of life (QoL) and utility estimates were obtained by interviewing 13 men with BPH symptoms using the standard gamble reference methods. Patients were classified as risk averse (RA) or non-risk averse (NRA) on the basis of their attitudes to risk. We calculated the incremental cost effectiveness of microwave thermotherapy relative to medical therapy and TURP over 5 years after treatment initiation. Event probabilities were obtained from the literature, a consensus panel, and published randomized clinical trials. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The utility values generated were internally consistent and externally valid for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 RA patients. Microwave thermotherapy was preferred by the NRA group, while medical therapy was preferred by the RA group. Surgery was least preferred by both groups. Microwave thermotherapy had a small incremental cost but improved QoL in comparison with medical therapy. Microwave thermotherapy had a higher utility and lower cost than TURP and thus was dominant over TURP.

1903,Introduction of lamivudine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: expected clinical and economic outcomes based on 4-year clinical trial data,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is associated with a significant burden of illness and treatment involves substantial health-care costs. This study estimates clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of lamivudine compared with other treatment scenarios for CHB, from an Australian health-care provider perspective. METHODS: A two-step modeling approach depicted clinical progression of hepatitis B in hypothetical patient cohorts using three different treatment scenarios: scenario A, lamivudine and alpha-interferon (IFN-alpha) available; scenario B, IFN-alpha available only; and scenario C, no treatment available. Assumptions were based on clinical trials, published studies, a hepatologist's questionnaire and an expert panel follow up. One-year clinical outcomes and costs were estimated using a decision tree, while lifetime costs and outcomes were estimated using available clinical trial data for lamivudine (up to 4 years therapy duration) and a Markov model. RESULTS: The analysis considered only patients with pretreatment elevated alanine aminotransferase levels > or = 2 x upper limit of normal. In the short term, the introduction of lamivudine is expected to result in almost 3.5 times more CHB patients receiving therapy (lamivudine or IFN-alpha) compared to IFN-alpha only (67% compared to 20%, respectively). Hence, scenario A subsequently doubled the seroconversion rate. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $3341 Australian per additional seroconversion. Also, non-seroconverted lamivudine patients are less likely to progress to cirrhosis than those receiving IFN-alpha/no treatment. One-year progression to cirrhosis was estimated at 5.1% with scenario A, compared to 12.2% and 12.7%, scenarios B and C, respectively. From the long-term analysis, lamivudine is expected to increase life expectancy by years and reduce the lifetime risk of compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma by 6%, 12% and 12%, respectively. Additionally, the introduction of lamivudine decreases lifetime costs by $548, thus making it a cost-saving and life-extending strategy. In both short- and long-term models, worst case scenarios in sensitivity analyses still associate lamivudine with a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSION: Introduction of lamivudine is expected to improve health outcomes in CHB patients, resulting in overall savings in health-care costs. In this model, compared with IFN-alpha only and no treatment, lamivudine allowed more CHB patients to be treated, increased the seroconversion rate, delayed disease progression and prolonged life expectancy.",2002-01-01168,11966945,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Steven Crowley,2002,17 / 2,153-64,No,11966945,"Steven Crowley; David Tognarini; Paul Desmond; Michael Lees; Gauri Saal; David Tognarini; Paul Desmond; Michael Lees; Gauri Saal; David Tognarini; Paul Desmond; Michael Lees; Gauri Saal; Introduction of lamivudine for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B: expected clinical and economic outcomes based on 4-year clinical trial data, J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2002-Feb; 17(2):0815-9319; 153-64",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Scenario where only treatment with IFN-alpha or no treatment was available vs. Scenario where treatment with lamivudine was available in addition to treatment with IFN-alpha or no treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-134,Australia,2000,-117.12

1905,The cost-effectiveness of ramipril in the treatment of patients at high risk of cardiovascular events: a Swedish sub-study to the HOPE study,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if long-term treatment with ramipril is cost-effective in patients at high risk of cardiovascular events. DESIGN: Randomized double-blind and placebo controlled. Information was gathered prospectively for a number of direct medical, direct nonmedical and indirect costs. SETTING AND SUBJECT: This is a sub-study to the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE) study performed in Swedish patients. All Swedish centres (19; n= 554) were invited to take part and 18 centres agreed to do so (n=537). The patients were managed in a specialist setting with a mean follow-up period of 4.5 years. Main outcome measures. The number of life-years saved was derived from the global HOPE study (n=9297) and subsequently the estimated life expectancy of those who completed the clinical study alive was added to the calculation. Direct medical costs related to cardiovascular disease only were considered in the primary analysis, whilst all kinds of costs and costs for all kinds of diseases were included in subsequent analyses. The cost of added years of life, according to the future cost method, was included in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The cost per life-year gained was SEK 16 600 (Euro 1940) when direct medical costs for cardiovascular reasons only were considered and SEK 45 400 (Euro 5300) when direct medical costs for all diseases were considered. The corresponding costs when direct nonmedical and indirect cost were added to the estimate were SEK 16 100 (Euro 1880) and SEK 54 600 (Euro 6380), respectively. When the future cost method was applied, the cost per life-year gained was SEK 208 300 (Euro 24 300).

1906,Economic evaluation of spinal cord stimulation for chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic aspects of treatment of chronic reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) with spinal cord stimulation (SCS), using outcomes and costs of care before and after the start of treatment. METHODS: Fifty-four patients with chronic RSD were randomized to receive either SCS together with physical therapy (SCS+PT; n = 36) or physical therapy alone (PT; n = 18). Twenty-four SCS+PT patients responded positively to trial stimulation and underwent SCS implantation. During 12 months of follow-up, costs (routine RSD costs, SCS costs, out-of-pocket costs) and effects (pain relief by visual analogue scale, health-related quality of life [HRQL] improvement by EQ-5D) were assessed in both groups. Analyses were carried out up to 1 year and up to the expected time of death. RESULTS: SCS was both more effective and less costly than the standard treatment protocol. As a result of high initial costs of SCS, in the first year, the treatment per patient is $4,000 more than control therapy. However, in the lifetime analysis, SCS per patient is $60,000 cheaper than control therapy. In addition, at 12 months, SCS resulted in pain relief (SCS+PT [-2.7] vs PT [0.4] [p < 0.001]) and improved HRQL (SCS+PT [0.22] vs PT [0.03] [p = 0.004]).

1907,Global drug-resistance patterns and the management of latent tuberculosis infection in immigrants to the United States,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, an increasingly disproportionate burden of tuberculosis among the foreign-born population has led to calls for improvements in the detection and treatment of latent infection in new immigrants. Current treatment guidelines do not take into account global differences in drug-resistance patterns or their implications for the treatment of immigrants. The use of multinational surveillance systems to guide the management of latent infection according to region-specific drug-resistance profiles could improve the efficiency of efforts to reduce the burden of tuberculosis in immigrants to the United States. METHODS: We constructed a decision-analysis model by using a hypothetical cohort of all documented immigrants entering the United States from developing nations. Region-specific drug-resistance profiles were derived from data on 30,388 cases of infection. The model examined the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of four strategies: no intervention or tuberculin skin testing followed by treatment with isoniazid, treatment with rifampin, or treatment with rifampin plus pyrazinamide for those with a positive test result. RESULTS: A strategy of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis infection was cost-saving among immigrants from Mexico, Haiti, sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and developing nations in East Asia and the Pacific. This strategy was highly cost effective among immigrants from other developing nations. Rifampin plus pyrazinamide was the preferred strategy for treating latent infection in immigrants from Vietnam, Haiti, and the Philippines. CONCLUSIONS: For new immigrants to the United States from developing nations, a strategy of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis infection would lead to substantial health and economic benefits.

1910,Impact of universal Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccination starting at 2 months of age in the United States: an economic analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the economic impact of universal Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination starting at 2 months of age. METHODS: Decision-tree-based analysis was conducted of a hypothetical US birth cohort of 3 815 469 infants using population-based vaccination coverage and disease incidence data. All costs were estimated from both the direct cost (medical and nonmedical) and societal perspectives. Net present value, cost-effectiveness ratios, and benefit-cost ratios of the US Hib vaccination program were evaluated. RESULTS: The results of these analyses showed that the universal vaccination program using the Hib conjugate vaccines in the United States in 2000 was cost-saving from both the direct and societal perspectives, with the benefit of the Hib vaccination program (net present value) from the direct cost and societal perspectives of $0.95 billion and $2.09 billion, respectively. Without a Hib vaccination program, the direct and societal costs of Hib invasive cases would be $1.35 billion and $2.58 billion, respectively. The direct and societal costs of the Hib vaccination program were estimated at $0.39 billion and $0.48 billion, respectively. The direct and societal benefit-cost ratios for the Hib vaccination program were 3.4 and 5.4, respectively. Varying the proportion of vaccines purchased and administered in the public versus the private sector and the proportion of combination vaccine versus monovalent vaccine administered did not have much effect on the results. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the perspective (direct cost or societal) and the assumptions used, the benefit-cost ratios of the US vaccination program are >1.0. Potential changes in the program, including use of more or less Hib combination vaccines, would not significantly alter the benefit-cost ratio.

1917,Cost-utility of interferon beta(1b) in the treatment of patients with active relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,"Economic evaluations of treatments for multiple sclerosis have focused either on relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive disease.None has addressed specifically the question of how treatments affect disease progression from diagnoses to severe disability;however, in both clinical and economic terms this is one of the key questions. This study therefore created a disease model that includes both relapsing and progressive multiple sclerosis and covers the full range of disease severity. In addition, the issue of covariates influencing the cost per QALY and the uncertainty in the estimates is addressed.The model is based on our earlier approach using a Markov model,where disease progression is measured as functional disability (EDSS), costs and utilities associated with different disability levels, and outcome expressed as QALY.Treatment is based on a subgroup of patients with active disease in two placebo-controlled clinical trials and open-label extensions with interferon-beta(1b) in relapsing-remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, and natural history data are used for the extrapolation beyond the trials.Disease progression (transition probabilities) was estimated using a probit model controlling for differences in patient and disease characteristics, and costs and utilities for different disability levels are taken from large population-based observational studies.Results are presented for Sweden and compared to the United Kingdom. When treatment is given for 36 months (adjusted for compliance) and no further effect is included, the cost per QALY is EURO 7800 (direct, indirect, and informal care costs included, discounted at 3%) over 10 years.The total number of QALYs increases from 3.45 in the no-treatment group to 3.64 in the treatment group.When treatment is prolonged to 54 months, the cost per QALY is EURO 38,700. Using the full range of costs and utilities, the probability that the cost per QALY over a 20-year time-frame is below EURO 50,000 for patients starting treatment at EDSS 3.0 is 80%.In view of the progression of MS over many years models are required to estimate the cost-effectiveness of new treatments.

1919,Pharmacoeconomic analysis of osteoporosis treatment with risedronate,"Hip fracture is an important and costly problem. Therapy with the bisphosphonate risedronate effectively prevents hip and other fractures among women with established osteoporosis. Risedronate is a first-choice therapy option in the German Guidelines of the Dachverband Osteologie for Osteoporosis according to evidence-based medicine criteria for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, osteoporosis of the elderly (women aged > 75 years) and glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. There are few published economic evaluations of bisphosphonates in Germany. Therefore, an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of risedronate utilizing a state transition Markov model of established postmenopausal osteoporosis based on randomized clinical trial data was developed. Uncertainty underlying model parameters and outcomes was dealt with using traditional sensitivity analysis and stochastic sensitivity analysis to produce quasi-95% Cls. We focused on patients aged 70 years, since this population most closely matches the randomized controlled trial and is typical of osteoporosis patients in Germany. The baseline model was a cohort of 1,000 70-year-old women, who received risedronate for 3 years and were followed up for an overall observation period of 10 years, modelling transitions through estimated health states and evaluating outcomes. Over the 3-year treatment period and 10-year observation period, risedronate dominated the current average basic treatment in Germany. In the risedronate group 33 hip fractures were averted and 32 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were gained (discounted values).

METHODS: The study population was a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients sixty years of age with severe diabetic foot ulcers. A decision tree model was constructed to estimate the CE of HBO2 therapy in the treatment of diabetic ulcers at years 1, 5, and 12. Scenario and one-way sensitivity analyses were also undertaken to identify parameters that may significantly influence the estimates. RESULTS: The CE model estimated that the incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained at years 1, 5, and 12, was dollar 27,310, dollar 5,166, and dollar 2,255, respectively.

1922,Psychological treatment for insomnia in the management of long-term hypnotic drug use: a pragmatic randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and cost impact of providing cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for insomnia (comprising sleep hygiene, stimulus control, relaxation and cognitive therapy components) to long-term hypnotic drug users in general practice. DESIGN: A pragmatic randomised controlled trial with two treatment arms (a CBT treated ""sleep clinic"" group, and a ""no additional treatment"" control group), with post-treatment assessments commencing at 3 and 6 months. SETTING: Twenty-three general practices in Sheffield, UK. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred and nine serially referred patients aged 31-92 years with chronic sleep problems who had been using hypnotic drugs for at least 1 month (mean duration = 13.4 years). RESULTS: At 3- and 6-month follow-ups patients treated with CBT reported significant reductions in sleep latency, significant improvements in sleep efficiency, and significant reductions in the frequency of hypnotic drug use (all P<0.01). Among CBT treated patients SF-36 scores showed significant improvements in vitality at 3 months (P<0.01). Older age presented no barrier to successful treatment outcomes. The total cost of service provision was 154.40 per patient, with a mean incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of 3416 (at 6 months). However, there was evidence of longer term cost offsets owing to reductions in sleeping tablet use and reduced utilisation of primary care services.

In October 2000, the Commonwealth Government introduced the National Q Fever Management Program. This economic evaluation assesses the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of improved vaccine uptake among meat and agricultural industry workers. METHODS: Separate analyses were conducted for meat and agricultural industry workers. Clinical and epidemiological data used to create the models were obtained from published sources. Markov modelling was used to estimate the impact of Q fever vaccination uptake on the direct costs and outcomes of Q fever over a 20-year period. RESULTS: Increasing vaccine uptake from 65% to 100% among meat industry workers results in an incremental cost per life year gained of $20,002, and a cost per QALY of $6,294. Increasing vaccine uptake from zero to 20% among agricultural industry workers results in an incremental cost per life year gained of $24,950, and a cost per QALY of $7,984.

1925,The benefits and costs of tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effects of key uncertainties on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of breast cancer prevention with tamoxifen. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of tamoxifen therapy relative to placebo was estimated using decision analysis with Markov modelling of health states, outcomes and costs for a simulated cohort of women at high risk for breast cancer. Relative effects of tamoxifen""s benefits and harms were estimated from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Cost estimates were based on Australian treatment patterns and costs. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with costs and effects discounted at a 5% annual rate. RESULTS: Tamoxifen therapy over five years reduces the incidence of breast cancer by approximately 1.4%, which is offset by an increase in endometrial cancer of 0.7% and pulmonary embolism of 0.2%. If the reduction is permanent (preventing new breast cancers emerging over five years and no further treatment effect thereafter), the model estimates an increase in life expectancy of 0.057 QALYs and an extra cost of $2,193; or $38,271/QALY gained. A model assuming further treatment effects of tamoxifen preventing new breast cancers emerging for up to 10 years results in an incremental cost of $19,354/QALY. However, if five years of tamoxifen therapy merely delays when these breast cancers appear (such that by 10 years there is no longer a reduced incidence), the incremental cost per QALY saved is estimated to be $199,149. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen is potentially cost-effective in preventing breast cancer in women at high risk. However, its cost-effectiveness as a preventive therapy is highly sensitive to whether these cancers are permanently prevented or their clinical presentation is only delayed.

1927,The benefits and costs of tamoxifen for breast cancer prevention,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effects of key uncertainties on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of breast cancer prevention with tamoxifen. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of tamoxifen therapy relative to placebo was estimated using decision analysis with Markov modelling of health states, outcomes and costs for a simulated cohort of women at high risk for breast cancer. Relative effects of tamoxifen""s benefits and harms were estimated from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials. Cost estimates were based on Australian treatment patterns and costs. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with costs and effects discounted at a 5% annual rate. RESULTS: Tamoxifen therapy over five years reduces the incidence of breast cancer by approximately 1.4%, which is offset by an increase in endometrial cancer of 0.7% and pulmonary embolism of 0.2%. If the reduction is permanent (preventing new breast cancers emerging over five years and no further treatment effect thereafter), the model estimates an increase in life expectancy of 0.057 QALYs and an extra cost of $2,193; or $38,271/QALY gained. A model assuming further treatment effects of tamoxifen preventing new breast cancers emerging for up to 10 years results in an incremental cost of $19,354/QALY. However, if five years of tamoxifen therapy merely delays when these breast cancers appear (such that by 10 years there is no longer a reduced incidence), the incremental cost per QALY saved is estimated to be $199,149. CONCLUSIONS: Tamoxifen is potentially cost-effective in preventing breast cancer in women at high risk. However, its cost-effectiveness as a preventive therapy is highly sensitive to whether these cancers are permanently prevented or their clinical presentation is only delayed.

1928,Optimal management when unsuspected N2 nodal disease is identified during thoracotomy for lung cancer: cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Whether to proceed with lung resection when N2 nodal disease is identified at the time of thoracotomy for lung cancer is controversial. A decision analysis model was developed to address this question. METHODS: A meta-analysis was performed on data from reports published between 1990 and 2002 evaluating survival for (1) patients who were treated by initial resection for clinically unsuspected N2 nodal disease (initial resection) and (2) survival for patients undergoing resection after neoadjuvant therapy for N2 nodal disease (no initial resection). Hospital cost data for surgery were derived from our institution, and cost data for chemotherapy and radiation therapy were obtained from current literature. A decision model was developed to compare initial resection to no initial resection from the perspective of the medical center using survival, quality-adjusted life years survival, and cost-effectiveness as outcomes. RESULTS: The no initial resection option provided better median survival (2.1 versus 1.7 years), quality-adjusted life years (1.8 versus 1.3), and cost-effectiveness, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 17,119 dollars/quality-adjusted life year. Outcomes were influenced by survival estimates for each treatment option. CONCLUSIONS: When N2 nodal disease is discovered during thoracotomy, the approach of delaying resection until after neoadjuvant therapy provides the best survival and is more cost-effective. This is likely due to the beneficial effects of neoadjuvant therapy and the exclusion of patients with more aggressive disease from the surgical candidate pool.",2003-01-00480,14688709,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,Mark K Ferguson,2003,126 / 6,1935-42,No,14688709,"Mark K Ferguson; Optimal management when unsuspected N2 nodal disease is identified during thoracotomy for lung cancer: cost-effectiveness analysis, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 2003-Dec; 126(6):0022-5223; 1935-42",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Resection after neoadjuvant therapy for N2 nodal disease vs. Initial resection,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,17119,United States,2002,24628.05
1929,Screening for proteinuria in US adults: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"CONTEXT: Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem. Screening for early identification could improve health but could also lead to unnecessary harms and excess costs. OBJECTIVE: To assess the value of periodic, population-based dipstick screening for early detection of urine protein in adults with neither hypertension nor diabetes and in adults with hypertension. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov decision analytic model to compare a strategy of annual screening with no screening (usual care) for proteinuria at age 50 years followed by treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II-receptor blocker (ARB). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: For persons with neither hypertension nor diabetes, the cost-effectiveness ratio for screening vs no screening (usual care) was unfavorable (282 818 dollars per QALY; incremental cost of 616 dollars and a gain of 0.0022 QALYs per person). However, screening such persons beginning at age 60 years yielded a more favorable ratio (53 372 dollars per QALY). For persons with hypertension, the ratio was highly favorable (18 621 dollars per QALY; incremental cost of 476 dollars and a gain of 0.03 QALYs per person). Cost-effectiveness was mediated by both chronic kidney disease progression and death prevention benefits of ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy. Influential parameters that might make screening for the general population more cost-effective include a greater incidence of proteinuria, age at screening (53 372 dollars per QALY for persons beginning screening at age 60 years), or lower frequency of screening (every 10 years: 80 700 dollars per QALY at age 50 years; 6195 dollars per QALY at age 60 years; and 5486 dollars per QALY at age 70 years).

1931,Transitioning the second-generation antihistamines to over-the-counter status: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee deemed the second-generation antihistamines (SGA) safe for over-the-counter use against the preliminary opposition of the manufacturers. As a result, loratadine is now available over-the-counter. First-generation antihistamines (FGA) are associated with an increased risk of unintentional injuries, fatalities, and reduced productivity. Access to SGA over-the-counter could result in decreased use of FGA, thereby reducing deleterious outcomes. The societal impact of transitioning this class of medications from prescription to over-the-counter status has important policy implications. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of transitioning SGA to over-the-counter status from a societal perspective. RESEARCH DESIGN: A simulation model of the decision to transition SGA to over-the-counter status was compared with retaining prescription-only status for a hypothetical cohort of individuals with allergic rhinitis in the United States. Estimates of costs and effectiveness were obtained from the medical literature and national surveys. Sensitivity analysis was performed using a second-order Monte Carlo simulation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted, quality-adjusted life-years saved as a result of amelioration of allergic rhinitis symptoms and avoidance of motor vehicle, occupational, public and home injuries and fatalities; discounted direct and indirect costs. RESULTS: Availability of SGA over-the-counter was associated with annual savings of 4 billion dollars (2.4-5.3 billion dollars) or 100 dollars (64-137 dollars) per allergic rhinitis sufferer and 135,061 time-discounted quality-adjusted life years (84,913-191,802). The sensitivity analysis provides evidence in support of these results. CONCLUSION: Making SGA available over-the-counter is both cost-saving and more effective for society, largely as a result of reduced adverse outcomes associated with FGA-induced sedation.

1932,Epidemiologic impact and cost-effectiveness of universal infant vaccination with a 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the main causes of bacterial meningitis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and otitis media in the Netherlands. These diseases lead to substantial mortality, morbidity, and costs. The societal impact is especially severe because most cases occur in very young infants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of universal infant vaccination with a 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in the Netherlands. METHODS: Decision analysis was performed using epidemiological data and data on health care resource use from 1996 to 2001. A model was used to project the impact of pneumococcal vaccination on the incidence of pneumococcal infections in infants and children from birth to age 10 years. Costs, benefits, and health gains were estimated, and cost-effectiveness was calculated. All analyses were performed from a societal perspective. RESULTS: On average, 339 cases per year of invasive pneumococcal infection occurred in infants and children from birth to age 10 years in the Netherlands from 1996 to 2001. The model predicted that introduction of the 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine would prevent 48 cases of bacterial meningitis and 88 cases of pneumococcal bacteremia per year, as well as 42,695 cases of pneumococcal otitis media and 3411 cases of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia. The model also predicted that vaccination would save 13 lives per year and prevent 31 cases of lifelong sequelae, rendering 382 discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained or 329 discounted life-years gained per year. Considering these health gains, vaccination would prevent Euro 9,453,600 of direct and indirect medical costs of meningococcal and pneumococcal infections in the Netherlands, including acute medical care, management of sequelae, and lost time at work. With a vaccine price of Euro 40 per dose, the base-case cost-effectiveness ratio would be Euro 71,250 per QALY. The model was sensitive to changes in incidence of infections, vaccine effectiveness, and vaccine price. CONCLUSIONS: Our analytic model predicted that universal pneumococcal vaccination of infants in the Netherlands could prevent a large number of pneumococcal infections and considerably reduce related mortality and morbidity. However, the baseline cost-effectiveness ratio of such a vaccination program would be relatively unfavorable compared with other interventions implemented in the Netherlands.",2003-01-00492,14667962,Clin Ther,Jasper M Bos,2003,25 / 10,2614-30,Yes,14667962,"Jasper M Bos; Hans Rümke; R Welte; Maarten J Postma; Epidemiologic impact and cost-effectiveness of universal infant vaccination with a 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine in the Netherlands, Clin Ther, 2003-Oct; 25(10):1879-114X; 2614-30",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal infant vaccination program with a hypothetical 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine vs. No vaccination,Not Stated,10 Years,0 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,71250,Euro,2001,93211.63

METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of results of sleeve lobectomy and pneumonectomy published in English from 1990 to 2003. A decision model was developed with 5-year survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and cost effectiveness as the outcomes, and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The model favored sleeve lobectomy (3.5 percentage point survival advantage) when the reward was 5-year survival; the results were influenced primarily by the 5-year survival rates for patients who did not develop recurrent cancer. Sleeve lobectomy was strongly favored when the reward was QALY (1.53 QALY advantage). Sleeve lobectomy was more cost effective than pneumonectomy, and had an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $1,300/QALY.

Clinicians must chose between very different therapies without the availability of comparison studies. We constructed a ""virtual"" clinical trial to help inform these treatment choices. DESIGN: We compare key outcomes related to survival, costs, and QOL using a Markov-type decision model to estimate the expected outcomes and costs for PAH patients treated for 1 year with bosentan and treprostinil compared to patients treated with epoprostenol, as well as patients treated with bosentan compared to those treated with treprostinil. The allowed transitions in the model were between World Health Organization functional class I to IV and death. Transition probabilities were based on observed transitions for bosentan. Treatment effect was estimated using 6-min walk data for treprostinil and epoprostenol. Utilities were calculated from estimated EuroQol health states. Cost was estimated from average wholesale price and Medicare reimbursement data. The effects of changing values of input variables on the key outcomes were calculated. RESULTS: Treatment with bosentan compared to treatment with either epoprostenol or treprostinil was less costly and resulted in a greater gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Conversely, treprostinil was significantly more expensive than epoprostenol, without an appreciable gain in QALYs. These findings were not substantially affected by the reasonable adjustments of transition probabilities, utility values, or tachyphylaxis to epoprostenol.

1937,Randomized comparison between stenting and off-pump bypass surgery in patients referred for angioplasty,"BACKGROUND: Stenting improves cardiac outcome in comparison with balloon angioplasty. Compared with conventional surgery, off-pump bypass surgery on the beating heart without cardiopulmonary bypass may reduce morbidity, hospital stay, and costs. The purpose, therefore, was to compare cardiac outcome, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness 1 year after stenting and after off-pump surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients referred for angioplasty (n=280) were randomly assigned to stenting (n=138) or off-pump bypass surgery. At 1 year, survival free from stroke, myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization was 85.5% after stenting and 91.5% after off-pump surgery (relative risk, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.02). Freedom from angina was 78.3% after stenting and 87.0% after off-pump surgery (P=0.06). Quality-adjusted lifetime was 0.82 year after stenting and 0.79 year after off-pump surgery (P=0.09). Hospital stay after the initial procedure was 1.43 and 5.77 days, respectively (P<0.01). Stenting reduced overall costs by 2933 dollars (26.2%) per patient (8276 dollars versus 11 209 dollars; P<0.01). Stenting was more cost-effective in 95% of the bootstrap estimates. CONCLUSIONS: At 1 year, stenting was more cost-effective than off-pump surgery while maintaining comparable cardiac outcome and quality of life.

1938,Cost effectiveness and cost utility model of public place defibrillators in improving survival after prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness and cost utility of locating defibrillators in all major airports, railway stations, and bus stations throughout Scotland. DESIGN: Economic modelling exercise with data from Heartstart (Scotland). Parameters used in economic model included direct costs derived for increased accident and emergency attendances, increased hospital bed days, purchase and maintenance of defibrillators, and training in their use; life years gained calculated from increased discharges from hospital and mean survival after discharge; utility (quality of life) obtained from published data. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of model. Future gains discounted at 1.5% a year and future costs at 6%. SETTING: Whole of Scotland. SUBJECTS: Records of all prehospital cardiac arrests due to presumed heart disease that occurred in a major airport, railway, or bus station between May 1991 and March 1998 and were not witnessed by ambulance or medical staff. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Observed survival to hospital admission and observed survival to discharge. Predicted survival calculated by applying observed survival in patients attended by ambulance staff within three minutes to those who waited longer. RESULTS: The total discounted direct costs were 18 325 pounds sterling a year. The cost per life year gained was 29 625 pounds sterling (49 625 dollars, 43 151 Euros) and the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained was pound 41 146 (68 924 dollars, 59 932 Euros).

CONCLUSIONS: The cost per QALY calculated for public place defibrillators represents poorer value for money than some alternative strategies for improving survival after prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest, such as the use of other trained first responders.

1939,Projecting the cost-effectiveness of adherence interventions in persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection,"PURPOSE: To explore the cost-effectiveness of interventions to improve adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHODS: A simulation model of HIV infection, incorporating CD4 cell count and HIV ribonucleic acid levels as predictors of disease progression, was used to estimate the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with clinical interventions to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy (e.g., directly observed therapy, automatic medication dispensers, beepers, portable alarms) in a clinical trial cohort with early disease (mean CD4 count, 350 cells/microL), a clinical trial cohort with advanced disease (mean CD4 count, 87 cells/microL), and an urban cohort (mean CD4 count, 217 cells/microL). Data were from clinical trials, national databases, and published literature. RESULTS: For relatively healthy patients with early disease, interventions that reduced virologic failure rates by 10% increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 3.2 months, whereas those that reduced failure by 80% increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 34.8 months, as compared with standard care. The cost-effectiveness ratio was below 50000 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for interventions costing 100 US dollars per month provided that failure rates were reduced by at least 10%, and for those costing 500 US dollars per month provided that failure rates were reduced by more than 50%. For both patients with advanced disease and those from an urban cohort, adherence interventions costing about 500 US dollars per month (e.g., directly observed therapy) had to reduce failure by about 25% to have cost-effectiveness ratios below 50000 US dollars per QALY.

1945,Cost-effectiveness of use of the GlucoWatch Biographer in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a preliminary analysis based on a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a preliminary analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the use of the GlucoWatch Biographer in the management of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents. METHODS: The computer model used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of intensive diabetes treatment in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) was modified to simulate cohorts of patients who participated in a small clinical trial at one center comparing standard and Biographer-assisted standard care. The model is a Monte Carlo simulation model that simulates the lives of individual patients. Cohorts of 10,000 patients are simulated to accumulate statistics on average treatment costs and complications. Complication and treatment costs were updated to 2002 dollars. Future costs and benefits are discounted using a rate of 3%. The perspective of the analysis is from a single payer of health care costs. RESULTS: The model predicts that use of the Biographer, if sustained for the life of the cohort, would delay the development of the first serious diabetes complication by 4.1 yr. Treating 18 subjects would prevent one case of blindness and 1.4 cases of renal failure. The intervention costs $91,059/years-of-life (YOL), $61,326/quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and $9930/yr free of a major complication. If the biographer ceased to be effective after age 17, the cost per QALY would increase to $103,178/QALY gained.

1946,Cost-effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide in the treatment of neonatal respiratory failure in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: Two recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) decreased the incidence of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or death in term and near-term newborns with hypoxic respiratory failure. Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness ratio of iNO in this population. METHODS: We studied 1000 simulation cohorts (n = 483 for each cohort) of term/near-term newborns with hypoxemic respiratory failure. We conducted our study following US Public Health Service Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine guidelines, adopting the US societal perspective. We constructed a decision tree reflecting iNO use, subsequent ECMO use, death, and long-term neurologic and respiratory morbidity in survivors, as determined from the combined outcomes of the 2 RCTs (n = 483). We estimated costs on the basis of length-of-stay data for the initial episode of care from 1 of the RCTs, unit costs from administrative data sets, and current pricing for iNO. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation to generate estimates of differences in costs and effects at 1 year, along with the stochastic uncertainty around these estimates. We expressed effects as quality-adjusted survival, assuming quality of life = 1 with no comorbidity, 0.7 with 1 comorbidity, and 0.49 (0.7 x 0.7) with 2 comorbidities. We constructed a base case, in which iNO was initiated at tertiary care ECMO centers (mimicking the RCTs) and a Public Health Service Panel on Cost-effectiveness in Health and Medicine reference case, in which iNO was initiated at the local hospital before transfer (mimicking real-world practice). We exposed our assumptions to a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Direct application of the trial results (base case) suggested that iNO was both more effective and cheaper (cost savings of 1880 dollars per case despite acquisition costs of 5150 dollars, predominantly as a result of decreased need for ECMO), with 84.6% probability that the cost-effectiveness ratio was better than 100,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. Under the reference case, iNO was also more effective (though slightly less so) and was even cheaper (cost savings of 4400 dollars per case), with 71.6% probability that iNO was cheaper and more effective and 91.6% probability that the cost effectiveness ratio was better than 100,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analyses showed these estimates to be sensitive to patient selection and the price of iNO but insensitive to assumptions regarding quality of life.

1948,Cost-utility analysis of cataract surgery in the second eye,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a reference case cost-utility analysis of second-eye cataract surgery by using the current literature on cataract outcomes and complications. DESIGN: Computer-based econometric modeling. METHODS: Visual acuity data of patients treated and observed over a 4-month postoperative period were obtained from the U.S. National Cataract Patient Outcomes Research Team report. The results from this prospective study were combined with those of other studies that investigated the complication rates of cataract surgery to complete the cohort of patients and outcomes. These synthesized data were incorporated with time trade-off utility values, which accounted for prior successful cataract surgery in the fellow eye. Cost-utility determinations were made with decision analysis, and present value modeling was used to account for the time value of money and health state consequences. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was calculated for the study group undergoing second-eye cataract surgery, assuming that the postoperative vision in the second eye was equivalent to the vision in the first eye after surgery (20/27). This was divided into the cost of the procedure to find the number of year 2001 nominal U.S. dollars spent per QALY gained. RESULTS: Second-eye cataract surgery, as compared with unilateral pseudophakia, resulted in a mean gain of 1.31 undiscounted QALYs per patient treated. A 3% annual discount rate, dependent on the duration of benefit, was used, yielding 0.92 discounted QALYs gained over a 12-year life expectancy. The mean discounted cost of treatment for each patient totaled 2509 US dollars. The cost divided by the QALYs gained (benefit) resulted in 2727 US dollars per QALY gained for this procedure. Sensitivity analysis varying costs and utility values revealed a range from 2045 US dollars to 3649 US dollars per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Second-eye cataract surgery is an extremely cost-effective procedure when compared with other interventions across medical specialties. The cost-effectiveness of second-eye surgery diminishes only slightly from the 2023 US dollars per QALY gained from first-eye cataract surgery. This suggests that patients with good vision in one eye and visual loss from cataract in the fellow eye derive substantial benefit from cataract extraction.",2003-01-00510,14644712,Ophthalmology,Brandon G Busbee,2003,110 / 12,2310-7,No,14644712,"Brandon G Busbee; Melissa M Brown; Gary C Brown; Sanjay Sharma; Cost-utility analysis of cataract surgery in the second eye, Ophthalmology, 2003-Dec; 110(12):0161-6420; 2310-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Second-eye cataract surgery vs. Preexisting unilateral pseudophakia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2727,United States,2001,3985.19
1949,Cost-utility analysis of intravenous immunoglobulin and prednisolone for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy,"The aim of this study was to provide an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis comparing intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and prednisolone treatment for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. Patients were recruited to a double-blind randomized crossover trial from nine European centres and received either prednisolone or IVIg during the first 6-week treatment period on which the economic evaluation was based. A societal perspective was adopted in measuring service use and costs, although the costs of lost employment were not included. The main outcome measure in the economic evaluation was the number of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, with change in a 11-point disability scale used to measure clinical outcomes. Service use and quality of life data were available for 25 patients. Baseline costs were controlled for using a bootstrapped multiple regression model. The cost difference between the two treatments was estimated to be euro 3754 over the 6-week period. Health-related quality of life, as measured by the EuroQol EQ-5D instrument, increased more in the IVIg group but the difference was not statistically significant. Using a net-benefit approach it was shown that the probability of IVIg being cost-effective in comparison with prednisolone was 0.5 or above (i.e. was more likely to be cost-effective than cost-ineffective) only if one QALY was valued at over euro 250 000.

1950,Economic and clinical effects of evaluating rapid viral response to peginterferon alfa-2b plus ribavirin for the initial treatment of chronic hepatitis C,"OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of 12-wk viral response to initial antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C has been recommended to minimize antiviral-associated morbidity and costs. The aim of this study was to examine the economic and clinical effects of evaluating rapid viral response during antiviral therapy for treatment naive chronic hepatitis C patients. METHODS: We applied viral response and drug dosage from an international randomized clinical trial of ribavirin plus peginterferon alfa-2b or ribavirin plus interferon alfa-2b to a previously published computer cohort simulation to project lifelong clinical and economic outcomes. Natural history and economic estimates were based on published literature, expert panel estimates, and actual variable and reimbursement cost data. RESULTS: The assessment of 12-wk rapid viral response reduced antiviral treatment duration by 40-44% and antiviral costs by 44-45% (savings of $15,116-16,268 for peginterferon plus ribavirin and $8300 for interferon plus ribavirin) compared to full 48-wk dosing. With the 12-wk evaluation, the marginal cost-effectiveness of peginterferon plus ribavirin versus interferon plus ribavirin was $13,600-22,800 compared with $14,600-25,000 per discounted quality adjusted life-year gained with the 24-wk evaluation. For genotype 1, hepatitis C infected patients, 12-wk testing for peginterferon plus ribavirin remaining preferred and cost-effective compared with interferon plus ribavirin. For genotype 2 or 3, hepatitis C infected patients, 12-wk testing yielded similar results to those of 24-wk treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of 12-wk viral response in genotype 1, hepatitis C infected patients should reduce peginterferon plus ribavirin morbidity and costs and improve its cost-effectiveness; however, for genotype 2 and 3, hepatitis C infected patients, 12-wk testing and 24-wk treatment have similar outcomes.

1955,Economic analysis of a school-based obesity prevention program,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of Planet Health, a school-based intervention designed to reduce obesity in youth of middle-school age children. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Standard cost-effectiveness analysis methods and a societal perspective were used in this study. Three categories of costs were measured: intervention costs, medical care costs associated with adulthood overweight, and costs of productivity loss associated with adulthood overweight. Health outcome was measured as cases of adulthood overweight prevented and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved. Cost-effectiveness ratio was measured as the ratio of net intervention costs to the total number of QALYs saved, and net-benefit was measured as costs averted by the intervention minus program costs. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, at an intervention cost of $33,677 or $14 US dollars per student per year, the program would prevent an estimated 1.9% of the female students (5.8 of 310) from becoming overweight adults. As a result, an estimated 4.1 QALYs would be saved by the program, and society could expect to save an estimated $15,887 USD in medical care costs and $25,104 USD in loss of productivity costs. These findings translated to a cost of $4305 USD per QALY saved and a net saving of $7313 USD to society. Results remained cost-effective under all scenarios considered and remained cost-saving under most scenarios. DISCUSSION: The Planet Health program is cost-effective and cost-saving as implemented. School-based prevention programs of this type are likely to be cost-effective uses of public funds and warrant careful consideration by policy makers and program planners.",2003-01-00517,14627751,Obes Res,Li Yan Wang,2003,11 / 11,1313-24,No,14627751,"Li Yan Wang; Quanhe Yang; Richard Lowry; Howell Wechsler; Economic analysis of a school-based obesity prevention program, Obes Res, 2003-Nov; 11(11):1071-7323; 1313-24",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Educational intervention vs. No intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,4305,United States,1996,7101.22
1956,Incorporating patient-centered outcomes in the analysis of cost-effectiveness: imaging strategies for renovascular hypertension,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the contribution of patient-centered short-term disutilities and quality-of-life measures in the cost-effectiveness analysis of CT angiography, MR angiography, and conventional angiography in patients with medication-resistant hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model compared the life expectancy and incremental cost per life year using three initial diagnostic tests in a cohort of hypothetical individuals with medication-resistant hypertension over a range of renal artery stenosis probabilities: CT angiography (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 96%; cost, $865); MR angiography (98%, 94%, $850); and conventional angiography (99%, 99%, $2,627). All imaging strategies were compared with a base case scenario mimicking the natural history of medication-resistant hypertension and with a scenario immediate enhanced medical therapy without prior imaging. Individuals without evidence of renal artery stenosis on initial testing underwent conventional angiography if enhanced medical therapy failed to control hypertension. Individuals diagnosed with renal artery stenosis on MR angiography required conventional angiography for definitive stent treatment ($11,1223). Blood pressure response to renal artery stenting or enhanced medical therapy varied according to blood pressure, as did the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke resulting from hypertension. Patients who progressed to end-stage renal disease received dialysis ($60,000 per year). Quality-of-life adjustments were made for patients with hypertension, end-stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Short-term disutilities from undergoing an imaging test were included. The analysis accounted for direct costs derived from Medicare reimbursements and total costs derived from the literature. RESULTS: All imaging strategies were cost-effective compared with enhanced medical therapy alone or with natural history. When only direct costs were considered, MR angiography was the preferred strategy, with conventional angiography as a cost-effective alternative to MR angiography. When total costs were considered, conventional angiography dominated all other strategies. Adjusting for quality of life decreased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, making an already competitive strategy a more favorable alternative to the base case. Adjusting for test-related disutility did not significantly influence the cost-effectiveness of any of the imaging tests.

1960,Incorporating patient-centered outcomes in the analysis of cost-effectiveness: imaging strategies for renovascular hypertension,"OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the contribution of patient-centered short-term disutilities and quality-of-life measures in the cost-effectiveness analysis of CT angiography, MR angiography, and conventional angiography in patients with medication-resistant hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision analytic model compared the life expectancy and incremental cost per life year using three initial diagnostic tests in a cohort of hypothetical individuals with medication-resistant hypertension over a range of renal artery stenosis probabilities: CT angiography (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 96%; cost, $865); MR angiography (98%, 94%, $850); and conventional angiography (99%, 99%, $2,627). All imaging strategies were compared with a base case scenario mimicking the natural history of medication-resistant hypertension and with a scenario immediate enhanced medical therapy without prior imaging. Individuals without evidence of renal artery stenosis on initial testing underwent conventional angiography if enhanced medical therapy failed to control hypertension. Individuals diagnosed with renal artery stenosis on MR angiography required conventional angiography for definitive stent treatment ($11,1223). Blood pressure response to renal artery stenting or enhanced medical therapy varied according to blood pressure, as did the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke resulting from hypertension. Patients who progressed to end-stage renal disease received dialysis ($60,000 per year). Quality-of-life adjustments were made for patients with hypertension, end-stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. Short-term disutilities from undergoing an imaging test were included. The analysis accounted for direct costs derived from Medicare reimbursements and total costs derived from the literature. RESULTS: All imaging strategies were cost-effective compared with enhanced medical therapy alone or with natural history. When only direct costs were considered, MR angiography was the preferred strategy, with conventional angiography as a cost-effective alternative to MR angiography. When total costs were considered, conventional angiography dominated all other strategies.

This article reports the results of an economic evaluation of adult liver transplantation in England and Wales. Patients placed on the waiting list for a liver transplant were observed over 27 months. The costs and health benefits of a comparison group, representing experience in the absence of liver transplantation, were estimated using a combination of observed data from patients waiting for a transplant and published prognostic models. The analysis focuses on three disease groups, for each of which prognostic models were available: primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). A higher proportion of patients with ALD were assessed for a transplant but not placed on the waiting list. The estimated gain in quality-adjusted life-years from transplantation was positive for each of the disease groups. The mean incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (95% bootstrap confidence intervals) from time of listing to 27 months for patients with PBC, ALD, and PSC are pound 29,000 (pounds 1,000 to pounds 59,000), pounds 48,000 (pounds 12,000 to pounds 83,000) and pounds 21,000 (-pounds 23,000 to pounds 60,000), respectively.

1971,Cost-effectiveness of coronary stenting and abciximab for patients with acute myocardial infarction: results from the CADILLAC (Controlled Abciximab and Device Investigation to Lower Late Angioplasty Complications) trial,"BACKGROUND: Both stenting and the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor abciximab improve outcomes for patients undergoing primary angioplasty for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, the cost-effectiveness of these strategies is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a prospective cost-utility analysis among US participants in the CADILLAC trial. Patients with AMI (n=1703) were randomized to stenting versus balloon angioplasty (PTCA) and abciximab versus no abciximab according to a 2-by-2 factorial design. Total 1-year costs and lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, measured as cost per quality-adjusted year of life (QALY) gained, were calculated. Compared with PTCA, stenting increased procedural costs by 1148 dollars and initial hospital costs by 1384 dollars (both P<0.001). By 1-year, stenting led to fewer repeat revascularization procedures and reduced follow-up medical care costs by 1215 dollars, such that aggregate costs were similar for the PTCA and stent groups (18 690 dollars versus 18 859 dollars, P=0.75). The cost-effectiveness ratio for stenting versus PTCA was favorable at 11 237 dollars/QALY gained and remained <20 000 dollars/QALY in sensitivity analyses. Compared with standard anticoagulation, abciximab increased initial procedural costs by 1122 dollars (P<0.001). By facilitating accelerated hospital discharge, abciximab reduced length of stay by approximately 0.6 days, offsetting most of the drug costs. These cost offsets were not maintained, however; aggregate 1-year costs for the abciximab group were 1244 dollars greater than for standard therapy (19 389 dollars versus 18 145 dollars , P=0.02). Abciximab was reasonably cost-effective (cost-effectiveness ratio 21 305 dollars/QALY) only if nonsignificant differences in 1-year mortality (3.7% versus 4.3%, P=0.62) were incorporated in the analysis.

OBJECTIVE: This study was a comprehensive economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of using the IBS for single-donor apheresis platelets (AP) and random-donor pooled platelet concentrates (PC) versus AP and PC without the IBS in the United States in patient populations in which platelets are commonly transfused. METHODS: All data used in this analysis were summarized from existing published sources (primarily indexed in MEDLINE) and data on file at Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Chicago, Illinois) and Cerus Corporation (Concord, California). A literature-based decision-analytic model was developed to assess the economic costs and clinical outcomes associated with the use of AP and PC treated with the IBS for several conditions and procedures that account for a considerable proportion of the platelet usage in the United States: acute lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin""s lymphoma, coronary artery bypass graft, and hip arthroplasty Risks of infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, or bacterial agents were incorporated into the model. Possible benefits of reduction of the risk of emerging HCV like pathogens and elimination of the need for gamma irradiation were explored in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained by using AP + IBS versus untreated AP ranged from 1,308,833 dollars to 4,451,650 dollars (without bacterial testing) and 4,759,401 dollars to 22,968,066 dollars (with bacterial testing). Corresponding figures for PC + IBS versus untreated PC ranged from 457,586 dollars to 1,816,060 dollars. Inclusion of emerging HCV like virus and the elimination of the need for gamma irradiation improved the cost-effectiveness to a range of 177,695 dollars to 1,058,127 dollars for AP without bacterial testing, 176,572 dollars to 1,330,703 dollars for AP with bacterial testing, and 22,888 dollars to 153,564 dollars for PC. The model was most likely to be affected by mortality from bacterial contamination, IBS effect on platelet utilization, and the inclusion of potential benefits (ie, gamma irradiation and/or emergent HCV-like virus). The model was relatively insensitive to changes in the IBS price and viral transmission risks.

1980,Cost-effectiveness of transfusion of platelet components prepared with pathogen inactivation treatment in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The Intercept Blood System (IBS) for platelets has been developed to reduce pathogen transmission risks during transfusions. OBJECTIVE: This study was a comprehensive economic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of using the IBS for single-donor apheresis platelets (AP) and random-donor pooled platelet concentrates (PC) versus AP and PC without the IBS in the United States in patient populations in which platelets are commonly transfused. METHODS: All data used in this analysis were summarized from existing published sources (primarily indexed in MEDLINE) and data on file at Baxter Healthcare Corporation (Chicago, Illinois) and Cerus Corporation (Concord, California). A literature-based decision-analytic model was developed to assess the economic costs and clinical outcomes associated with the use of AP and PC treated with the IBS for several conditions and procedures that account for a considerable proportion of the platelet usage in the United States: acute lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin""s lymphoma, coronary artery bypass graft, and hip arthroplasty Risks of infection with HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, or bacterial agents were incorporated into the model. Possible benefits of reduction of the risk of emerging HCV like pathogens and elimination of the need for gamma irradiation were explored in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained by using AP + IBS versus untreated AP ranged from 1,308,833 dollars to 4,451,650 dollars (without bacterial testing) and 4,759,401 dollars to 22,968,066 dollars (with bacterial testing). Corresponding figures for PC + IBS versus untreated PC ranged from 457,586 dollars to 1,816,060 dollars. Inclusion of emerging HCV like virus and the elimination of the need for gamma irradiation improved the cost-effectiveness to a range of 177,695 dollars to 1,058,127 dollars for AP without bacterial testing, 176,572 dollars to 1,330,703 dollars for AP with bacterial testing, and 22,888 dollars to 153,564 dollars for PC.

1985,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A/B vaccine versus hepatitis B vaccine in public sexually transmitted disease clinics,"BACKGROUND: Many patients seen at U.S. sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics are offered hepatitis B vaccination. Substituting hepatitis A/B vaccine would provide additional protection but increase costs. GOAL: The goal was to estimate the cost effectiveness of hepatitis A/B versus B vaccination for 1,000,000 public STD clinic attenders. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model of hepatitis A outcomes was developed using published literature, U.S. government databases, and expert panel opinion. Added vaccination costs were compared with savings from reduced hepatitis A treatment. Net costs were compared with life-years saved and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: Substituting hepatitis A/B vaccine would prevent 2263 overt hepatitis A infections, 292 hospitalizations, 8 premature deaths, and the loss of 281 QALYs. Net health system costs would be $20,892 per life-year saved, or $13,397 per QALY gained.

1986,Illustrating the impact of including future costs in economic evaluations: an application to end-stage renal disease care,"There are strong theoretical arguments for including future costs for related and unrelated medical care and non-medical expenditures within economic evaluations. Nevertheless, there is limited data on how inclusion of such costs affects the cost effectiveness of medical interventions in practice. For a low-cost intervention that improves survival in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, we sought to determine how the inclusion of future costs for related medical care (i.e. dialysis and transplantation) and for unrelated medical care and non-medical expenditure would affect the magnitude of the cost per QALY ratio. We performed a cost-utility analysis comparing hemodialysis using a synthetic dialyser (the current treatment of choice in Canada) with the historical gold-standard treatment (use of a cellulose dialyser). We contrasted the results of the analysis including and excluding various measures of future costs. While the inclusion of future costs for unrelated medical care and non-medical expenditures had a significant impact on the cost per QALY ratio, the size of the cost per QALY ratio was most sensitive to inclusion of future costs for related medical care. Our analysis shows that even relatively inexpensive interventions that extend survival of dialysis patients may not be cost-effective since, by extending survival, the extra outpatient dialysis costs that are incurred are large.

1990,Risk factor profile and achievement of treatment goals among hypertensive patients from the Israeli Blood Pressure Control (IBPC) program--initial cost utility analysis,"AIMS: Blood pressure (BP) reduction is crucial in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The IBPC (Israeli Blood Pressure Control) program was initiated in order to enhance the control of modifiable risk factors among high-risk hypertensive patients under follow-up by general practitioners in Israel. The cost effectiveness of an intervention program is an important factor in the decision-making process of its implementation and therefore was evaluated here. The objective of this evaluation is to estimate the costs, monetary savings and benefits in terms of QALYs (quality-adjusted life years) that would be expected if the program were to be expanded to 100 clinics nationwide, enabling around 14800 persons to be treated. METHODS: Hypertensive patients were screened in 30 general practice clinics, supervised by specialists in family medicine, each seeing 1000-5000 patients; 50-250 hypertensive patients were diagnosed at each participating clinic. BP levels, body mass index (BMI), lipid and glucose levels, as well as target organ damage and medications were recorded for all patients. RESULTS: A total of 4948 (2079, 42% males) were registered. Mean age was 64.8 +/- 12 years. After 1 year of follow-up versus baseline, the various parameters were as follows: BP control was achieved in 46.4% vs 29% of all hypertensive patients. LDL control (JNC VI criteria) was achieved in 41.7% vs 31.2% of all patients. Fasting plasma glucose control (glucose < 126 mg/dl) was achieved in 22% vs 19% of diabetic patients and 5.2% vs 3.1% of the diabetics had fasting plasma glucose levels > 200 mg/dl. Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) was noted in 36.7% vs 43.8% at baseline. The cost utility analysis of the reduction in risk factors was calculated based on the international dicta applied to the reduction in risk factors as a result of treatment. For 100 clinics nationwide and 14800 persons to be treated the net saving to health services would be $977993 and the increase in QALYs would be 602 years.

1991,Cost-effectiveness of recombinant human activated protein C and the influence of severity of illness in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) compared with usual therapy for patients with severe sepsis, and also to determine the influence that severity of illness exerts on cost-effectiveness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We use a Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment strategies for patients with severe sepsis. Therapy includes treatment with either rhAPC and usual therapy, or usual therapy alone. Probabilities for clinical outcomes were obtained from a large randomized clinical trial comparing the use of rhAPC with placebo (PROWESS study) and from outcomes literature for patients with severe sepsis and its complications. Cost estimates were based on Medicare reimbursement rates, Health Care Financing Administration information and the literature. Outcome measures include life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Compared with usual therapy alone, rhAPC treatment for patients with very severe sepsis (APACHE II score > or = 25) was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13 493/QALY. Treatment of patients with less severe sepsis with rhAPC (APACHE II score < 25) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $403,000/QALY. For patients with very severe sepsis the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for treatment with rhAPC remained under $30,000/QALY, over a broad range of variables, including costs of rhAPC, costs of acute care and costs and probabilities of complications of treatment. For patients with less severe sepsis, drug costs would need to fall well below current market price before achieving cost-effectiveness. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis comparing rhAPC treatment with usual therapy for patients with very severe sepsis showed that < 1% of Monte Carlo simulations had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios > $50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The use of rhAPC for the treatment of patients with very severe sepsis, as determined by APACHE II score > or = 25, appears cost-effective, while treatment of patients with APACHE II score < 25 is not cost-effective.",2003-01-00546,14595571,J Crit Care,Robert A Fowler,2003,18 / 3,181-91; discussion 191-4,No,14595571,"Robert A Fowler; Marya Hill-Popper; John Stasinos; Constantia Petrou; Gillian D Sanders; Alan M Garber; Cost-effectiveness of recombinant human activated protein C and the influence of severity of illness in the treatment of patients with severe sepsis, J Crit Care, 2003-Sep; 18(3):0883-9441; 181-91; discussion 191-4",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) and usual care vs. Usual anti-infective therapy and usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,20047,United States,2001,29296.35
1992,Newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry for medium-chain Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether newborn screening by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) for medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) is cost-effective versus not screening and to define the contributions of disease, test, and population parameters on the decision. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was designed to perform cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses measuring the discounted, incremental cost per life-year saved and per quality-adjusted life-year saved of newborn screening for MCADD compared with not screening. A hypothetical cohort of neonates made transitions among a set of health states that reflected clinical status, morbidity, and cost. Outcomes were estimated for time horizons of 20 and 70 years. Probabilities and costs were derived from a retrospective chart review of a 32-patient cohort treated over the past 30 years at the Children""s Hospital of Philadelphia, clinical experience with MCADD patient management, patient-family interviews, cost surveys, state sources, and published studies. In addition to older patients who came to medical attention by symptomatic presentation, our patient group included 6 individuals whose MCADD had been diagnosed by supplemental newborn screening. Estimates of the expected net changes in costs and life expectancy for MCADD screening were used to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analyses were performed on key input variables, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed through second-order Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: In our base-case analysis over the first 20 years of life, the cost of newborn screening for MCADD was approximately 11,000 dollars(2001 US dollars; 95% CI: <0-33,800 dollars) per life-year saved, or 5600 dollars (95% CI: <0-17,100 dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year saved compared with not screening. Over a 70-year horizon, the respective ratios were approximately 300 dollars (95% CI: <0-13,000 dollars) and 100 dollars (95% CI: <0-6900 dollars). The results were robust when tested over plausible ranges for diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity, MCADD prevalence, asymptomatic rate, and screening cost. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation modeling indicates that newborn screening for MCADD reduces morbidity and mortality at an incremental cost below the range for accepted health care interventions.

1994,Cost-utility analysis of survival with epoetin-alfa versus placebo in stage IV breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: In a multinational trial of anaemic patients with cancer receiving nonplatinum-containing chemotherapy, epoetin-alfa effectively increased haemoglobin levels, reduced red blood cell transfusion requirements, and improved QOL. Although the study was not designed or powered to evaluate survival, a survival trend was noted favouring epoetin-alfa compared with placebo (median survival 17 vs 11 months [p = 0.126]). OBJECTIVES: To determine the incremental cost utility of epoetin-alfa versus placebo in anaemic patients with stage IV breast cancer from a UK National Health Service perspective. METHODS: Patient data regarding transfusions, epoetin-alfa usage, chemotherapy treatment cycles, and adverse events were recorded, with survival follow-up for 12-36 months post-study. Stage IV breast cancer therapy costs were collected by surveying UK oncologists, and utilities for associated health states were from published sources. Costs were in British pounds and year 2000 values. Costs and benefits were jointly determined for the stage IV breast cancer subgroup (n = 55). Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated assuming a 6% annual discount rate for costs and a 1.5% annual discount rate for benefits. Bootstrap simulations (10,000 iterations) were conducted to account for uncertainty, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to establish robustness. RESULTS: The ICUR for epoetin-alfa treatment was pounds 8,851 per QALY, with a 99% probability of a positive net benefit in QALYs (net benefit = 0.4805 years of perfect life) and a 94% probability of being acceptable using a threshold ICUR of pounds 30,000/QALY. The main cost drivers distinguishing epoetin-alfa from placebo were the costs of drug and patient care due to increased survival. CONCLUSIONS: The available data suggest a high probability of favourable cost-utility outcomes with epoetin-alfa treatment for anaemia in patients with stage IV breast cancer receiving nonplatinum-containing chemotherapy.

1995,A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis of letrozole followed by tamoxifen versus tamoxifen followed by letrozole for postmenopausal advanced breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Third-generation aromatase inhibitors are being considered as an alternative to tamoxifen as first-line therapy for advanced breast cancer. These newer therapies are more expensive, and will gain greater acceptance if they can demonstrate cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Life table analyses are used to compare the costs and benefits [life years gained and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained] of treating postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer with first-line letrozole (with the option of second-line tamoxifen) compared with first-line tamoxifen (with the option of second-line letrozole). Patient-level data from a large clinical trial describes the effectiveness of the therapy options, clinicians estimate resource usage and utility values are obtained from the literature. RESULTS: The mean cost of providing first- and second-line hormonal therapy is pound 4765 if letrozole is the first-line therapy and pound 3418 if tamoxifen is provided first (a difference of pound 1347). However, patients receiving letrozole as first-line therapy gain an additional 0.228 life years, or 0.158 QALYs. The cost-effectiveness analysis found that first-line hormonal therapy with letrozole gains additional life years at a cost of pound 5917, whilst the cost per additional QALY gained is pound 8514. CONCLUSION: The strategy of letrozole as first-line hormonal therapy not only provides an opportunity for extending and improving patient""s quality of life, but also is highly cost-effective compared with other generally accepted medical treatments.",2003-01-00553,14581270,Ann Oncol,Jon Karnon,2003,14 / 11,1629-33,No,14581270,"Jon Karnon; S R D Johnston; T Jones; A Glendenning; A trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis of letrozole followed by tamoxifen versus tamoxifen followed by letrozole for postmenopausal advanced breast cancer, Ann Oncol, 2003-Nov; 14(11):0923-7534; 1629-33",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with first-line letrozole (with the option of second-line tamoxifen) vs. Treatment with first-line tamoxifen (with the option of second-line letrozole),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,6.00,1.50,84726.41,United Kingdom,2001,178254.01

METHOD: The costs for treatment and the quality of life according to the SF-36 were analyzed in a retrospective health economic study on 65 patients who had undergone surgery for primary non-small-cell lung cancer. RESULTS: The mean cost for all patients was 7,169 euro per patient. 38.8 % resulted from surgery, 31.6 % were attached to the preoperative phase on the general ward, 11 % postoperatively to the general ward. Intensive care costs accounted for 18.7 %. The cost of each surgical procedure ranged from 4,634 euro for a pneumonectomy to 8,366 euro for a lobectomy with sleeve resection of the bronchus. The most expensive factors were staff, disposable materials, pathological investigations, and radiology services.

2000,Screening for hepatitis C in genito-urinary medicine clinics: a cost utility analysis,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: To estimate the cost utility (cost per QALY) of screening for hepatitis C (HCV) infection in people attending genito-urinary medicine clinics in England. METHODS: An epidemiological model of screening and diagnosis was combined with a Markov chain model of treatment with combination therapy to estimate cost utility. Parameters for the model were informed by literature review, expert opinion and a survey of current screening practice. RESULTS: The base case estimate was about pound 85,000 per QALY. Selective screening is more cost effective. If screening is restricted to only 20% or 10% of attenders, cost utility is estimated as pound 39,647 and pound 34,288 per QALY. If screening is restricted only to those with a history of injecting drug use, cost utility would be pound 27,138 per QALY. Estimates are particularly sensitive to acceptance rates for screening and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Universal screening for HCV in GUM clinics is unlikely to be cost effective. There is limited evidence to support screening of people other than those with a history of injecting drug use and even this policy should be considered with some care and in the context of further research.",2003-01-00560,14568266,J Hepatol,Ken Stein,2003,39 / 5,814-25,No,14568266,"Ken Stein; K Dalziel; Andrew Walker; Becky Jenkins; Ali Round; Pam Royle; Screening for hepatitis C in genito-urinary medicine clinics: a cost utility analysis, J Hepatol, 2003-Nov; 39(5):0168-8278; 814-25",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal screening for Hepatitis C virus vs. No screening,Not Stated,32 Years,32 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,1.50,84570,United Kingdom,2001,177924.94
