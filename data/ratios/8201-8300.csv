8201,Cost-effectiveness of interventions to return employees to work following long-term sickness absence due to musculoskeletal disorders.,"BACKGROUND: Sickness absence costs the UK economy around ?20 billion per year. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions to return employees with musculoskeletal disorders to work, one of the major causes of long-term sickness absence, using a mathematical model. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of three interventions: a workplace intervention; a physical activity and education intervention and a physical activity, education and workplace visit intervention. Extensive sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the impact of uncertainties upon the model results. RESULTS: All interventions assessed are estimated to have a cost per quality-adjusted life year gained below ?3000 compared with usual care within the UK from a National Health Service (NHS) or societal perspective. Moreover, any intervention which returns at least an additional 3% of employees to work and costs less than an additional ?3000 per employee, is likely to be considered economically attractive compared with usual care, relative to other interventions routinely funded by the NHS. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first economic evaluation in this area which extrapolates data beyond trial follow-up and synthesizes evidence from numerous sources.

8204,Optimal control of hepatitis C antiviral treatment programme delivery for prevention amongst a population of injecting drug users.,"In most developed countries, HCV is primarily transmitted by injecting drug users (IDUs). HCV antiviral treatment is effective, and deemed cost-effective for those with no re-infection risk. However, few active IDUs are currently treated. Previous modelling studies have shown antiviral treatment for active IDUs could reduce HCV prevalence, and there is emerging interest in developing targeted IDU treatment programmes. However, the optimal timing and scale-up of treatment is unknown, given the real-world constraints commonly existing for health programmes. We explore how the optimal programme is affected by a variety of policy objectives, budget constraints, and prevalence settings. We develop a model of HCV transmission and treatment amongst active IDUs, determine the optimal treatment programme strategy over 10 years for two baseline chronic HCV prevalence scenarios (30% and 45%), a range of maximum annual budgets (?50,000-300,000 per 1,000 IDUs), and a variety of objectives: minimising health service costs and health utility losses; minimising prevalence at 10 years; minimising health service costs and health utility losses with a final time prevalence target; minimising health service costs with a final time prevalence target but neglecting health utility losses. The largest programme allowed for a given budget is the programme which minimises both prevalence at 10 years, and HCV health utility loss and heath service costs, with higher budgets resulting in greater cost-effectiveness (measured by cost per QALY gained compared to no treatment). However, if the objective is to achieve a 20% relative prevalence reduction at 10 years, while minimising both health service costs and losses in health utility, the optimal treatment strategy is an immediate expansion of coverage over 5-8 years, and is less cost-effective. By contrast, if the objective is only to minimise costs to the health service while attaining the 20% prevalence reduction, the programme is deferred until the final years of the decade, and is the least cost-effective of the scenarios.",2011-01-07810,21853030,PLoS One,Natasha K Martin,2011,6 /,e22309,No,21853030,"Natasha K Martin; Ashley B Pitcher; Peter Vickerman; Anna Vassall; Matthew Hickman; Optimal control of hepatitis C antiviral treatment programme delivery for prevention amongst a population of injecting drug users., PLoS One , ; 6 ():1932-6203; e22309",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,10 year treatment program vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,3.50,3.50,1120,United Kingdom,2009,1956.34
8205,"Stapled hemorrhoidopexy, an innovative surgical procedure for hemorrhoidal prolapse: cost-utility analysis.","To undertake full economic evaluation of stapled hemorrhoidopexy (PPH) to establish its cost-effectiveness and investigate whether PPH can become cost-saving compared to conventional excisional hemorrhoidectomy (CH).A cost-utility analysis in hospital and health care system (UK) was undertaken using a probabilistic, cohort-based decision tree to compare the use of PPH with CH. Sensitivity analyses allowed showing outcomes in regard to the variations in clinical practice of PPH procedure. The participants were patients undergoing initial surgical treatment of third and fourth degree hemorrhoids within a 1-year time-horizon. Data on clinical effectiveness were obtained from a systematic review of the literature. Main outcome measures were the cost per procedure at the hospital level, total direct costs from the health care system perspective, quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental cost per QALY gained.A decrease in operating theater time and hospital stay associated with PPH led to a cost saving compared to CH of GBP 27 (US $43.11, ?30.50) per procedure at the hospital level and to an incremental cost of GBP 33 (US $52.68, ?37.29) after one year from the societal perspective. Calculation of QALYs induced an incremental QALY of 0.0076 and showed an incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) of GBP 4316 (US $6890.47, ?4878.37). Taking into consideration recent literature on clinical outcomes, PPH becomes cost saving compared to CH for the health care system.PPH is a cost-effective procedure with an ICER of GBP 4136 and it seems that an innovative surgical procedure could be cost saving in routine clinical practice.",2011-01-07812,21853544,Croat Med J,Goran Ribaric,2011,52 /,497-504,No,21853544,"Goran Ribaric; Justus Kofler; David G Jayne; Stapled hemorrhoidopexy, an innovative surgical procedure for hemorrhoidal prolapse: cost-utility analysis., Croat Med J, ; 52 ():0353-9504; 497-504",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Stapled hemorrhoidopexy (PPH) vs. Excisional hemorrhoidectomy (CH),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,4316,United Kingdom,2009,7538.91
8206,Promoting smoking cessation in Pakistani and Bangladeshi men in the UK: pilot cluster randomised controlled trial of trained community outreach workers.,"ABSTRACT:Smoking prevalence is high among Pakistani and Bangladeshi men in the UK, but there are few tailored smoking cessation programmes for Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. The aim of this study was to pilot a cluster randomised controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of Pakistani and Bangladeshi smoking cessation outreach workers with standard care to improve access to and the success of English smoking cessation services.A pilot cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in Birmingham, UK. Geographical lower layer super output areas were used to identify natural communities where more than 10% of the population were of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin. 16 agglomerations of super output areas were randomised to normal care controls vs. outreach intervention. The number of people setting quit dates using NHS services, validated abstinence from smoking at four weeks, and stated abstinence at three and six months were assessed. The impact of the intervention on choice and adherence to treatments, attendance at clinic appointments and patient satisfaction were also assessed.We were able to randomise geographical areas and deliver the outreach worker-based services. More Pakistani and Bangladeshi men made quit attempts with NHS services in intervention areas compared with control areas, rate ratio (RR) 1.32 (95%CI: 1.03-1.69). There was a small increase in the number of 4-week abstinent smokers in intervention areas (RR 1.30, 95%CI: 0.82-2.06). The proportion of service users attending weekly appointments was lower in intervention areas than control areas. No difference was found between intervention and control areas in choice and adherence to treatments or patient satisfaction with the service. The total cost of the intervention was ?124,000; an estimated cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of ?8,500.The intervention proved feasible and acceptable. Outreach workers expanded reach of smoking cessation services in diverse locations of relevance to Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities. The outreach worker model has the potential to increase community cessation rates and could prove cost-effective, but needs evaluating definitively in a larger, appropriately powered, randomised controlled trial. These future trials of outreach interventions need to be of sufficient duration to allow embedding of new models of service delivery.Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN82127540.",2011-01-07814,21854596,Trials,Rachna A Begh,2011,12 /,197,No,21854596,"Rachna A Begh; Paul Aveyard; Penney Upton; Raj S Bhopal; Martin White; Amanda Amos; Robin J Prescott; Raman Bedi; Pelham Barton; Monica Fletcher; Paramjit Gill; Qaim Zaidi; Aziz Sheikh; Promoting smoking cessation in Pakistani and Bangladeshi men in the UK: pilot cluster randomised controlled trial of trained community outreach workers., Trials, ; 12 ():1745-6215; 197",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,smoking cessation program vs. Standard or care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,8500,United Kingdom,2009,14847.26
8207,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the most common orthopaedic surgery procedures: knee arthroscopy and knee anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,"The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of knee arthroscopy and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from a single-surgeon, institutional review board-approved outcomes registry included 2 cohorts: surgically treated knee arthroscopy and ACL reconstruction patients. Our outcome measure is cost-effectiveness (cost of a quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). The QALY is calculated by multiplying difference in health-related quality of life, before and after treatment, by life expectancy. Health-related quality of life is measured by use of the Quality of Well-Being scale, which has been validated for cost-effectiveness analysis. Costs are facility charges per the facility cost-to-charges ratio plus surgeon fee. Sensitivity analyses are performed to determine the effect of variations in costs or outcomes.There were 93 knee arthroscopy and 35 ACL reconstruction patients included at a mean follow-up of 2.1 years. Cost per QALY was $5,783 for arthroscopy and $10,326 for ACL reconstruction (2009 US dollars).

8209,A discrete event modelling framework for simulation of long-term outcomes of sequential treatment strategies for ankylosing spondylitis.,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a modelling framework which can simulate long-term quality of life, societal costs and cost-effectiveness as affected by sequential drug treatment strategies for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: Discrete event simulation paradigm was selected for model development. Drug efficacy was modelled as changes in disease activity (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI)) and functional status (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)), which were linked to costs and health utility using statistical models fitted based on an observational AS cohort. Published clinical data were used to estimate drug efficacy and time to events. Two strategies were compared: (1) five available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (strategy 1) and (2) same as strategy 1 plus two tumour necrosis factor a inhibitors (strategy 2). 13 000 patients were followed up individually until death. For probability sensitivity analysis, Monte Carlo simulations were performed with 1000 sets of parameters sampled from the appropriate probability distributions. RESULTS: The models successfully generated valid data on treatments, BASDAI, BASFI, utility, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs at time points with intervals of 1-3 months during the simulation length of 70 years. Incremental cost per QALY gained in strategy 2 compared with strategy 1 was ?35 186. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of ?80 000, it was 99.9% certain that strategy 2 was cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The modelling framework provides great flexibility to implement complex algorithms representing treatment selection, disease progression and changes in costs and utilities over time of patients with AS.

8210,A cost-effectiveness study of the community-based intervention '10 000 Steps Ghent',"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the European community-based project '10 000 Steps Ghent', an intervention that resulted in a significant decrease in sedentary time and a significant increase in step counts (896 steps/d) and self-reported walking (66 min/week). DESIGN: An age- and gender-dependent Markov model, with a time horizon of 20 years and a cycle length of 1 year, estimating the development of diabetes, cardiovascular events and colorectal cancer. SETTING: All individuals started in a health state free of events. The effect of the intervention was based on published risk reductions related to increased walking time. Costs and utility decrements related to events were obtained from published literature. The impact of the uncertainty of the parameters on incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were assessed with one-way sensitivity analyses and a Monte Carlo analysis. SUBJECTS: Cohort representing the population reached by the intervention (266 adults aged 25-75 years with a mean age of 48?2 (sd 13?1) years, 45?6 % men, 64?6 % highly educated, 70?0 % employed). RESULTS: Implementing the community-based programme increased average QALY by 0?16 and 0?11 for men and women, respectively. The total costs decreased by approximately 576? and 427?, respectively. Hence, for both genders the intervention programme was dominant.

8212,The potential cost-effectiveness of infant pneumococcal vaccines in Australia.,"Over the last decade infant pneumococcal vaccination has been adopted as part of routine immunisation schedules in many developed countries. Although highly successful in many settings such as Australia and the United States, rapid serotype replacement has occurred in some European countries. Recently two pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) with extended serotype coverage have been licensed for use, a 10-valent (PHiD-CV) and a 13-valent (PCV-13) vaccine, and offer potential replacements for the existing vaccine (PCV-7) in Australia. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PCV programs we developed a static, deterministic state-transition model. The perspective for costs included those to the government and healthcare system. When compared to current practice (PCV-7) both vaccines offered potential benefits, with those estimated for PHiD-CV due primarily to prevention of otitis media and PCV-13 due to a further reduction in invasive disease in Australia. At equivalent total cost to vaccinate an infant, compared to no PCV the base-case cost per QALY saved were estimated at A$64,900 (current practice, PCV-7; 3+0), A$50,200 (PHiD-CV; 3+1) and A$55,300 (PCV-13; 3+0), respectively. However, assumptions regarding herd protection, serotype protection, otitis media efficacy, and vaccination cost changed the relative cost-effectiveness of alternative PCV programs.

8215,The potential cost-effectiveness of infant pneumococcal vaccines in Australia.,"Over the last decade infant pneumococcal vaccination has been adopted as part of routine immunisation schedules in many developed countries. Although highly successful in many settings such as Australia and the United States, rapid serotype replacement has occurred in some European countries. Recently two pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) with extended serotype coverage have been licensed for use, a 10-valent (PHiD-CV) and a 13-valent (PCV-13) vaccine, and offer potential replacements for the existing vaccine (PCV-7) in Australia. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PCV programs we developed a static, deterministic state-transition model. The perspective for costs included those to the government and healthcare system. When compared to current practice (PCV-7) both vaccines offered potential benefits, with those estimated for PHiD-CV due primarily to prevention of otitis media and PCV-13 due to a further reduction in invasive disease in Australia. At equivalent total cost to vaccinate an infant, compared to no PCV the base-case cost per QALY saved were estimated at A$64,900 (current practice, PCV-7; 3+0), A$50,200 (PHiD-CV; 3+1) and A$55,300 (PCV-13; 3+0), respectively.

8216,Cost-Effectiveness of a Novel Molecular Test for Cytologically Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules.,"Context: Determining which patients with thyroid nodules require surgery is limited by cytologically indeterminate findings. A new approach for preoperative molecular classification of cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules has a reported sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 75%; however, its cost-effectiveness has yet to be assessed. Objective: Our objective was to evaluate the 5-yr cost-effectiveness of routine use of a molecular test in adult patients with indeterminate fine-needle aspiration biopsy results from a societal perspective. Design: A 16-state Markov decision model was developed. Probabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated from literature review, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data, Medicare reimbursement schedules, and expert opinion. Setting and Subjects: Decision analysis of a hypothetical group of adult patients with cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules was conducted. Main Outcome Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as incremental cost (measured in U.S. dollars) divided by incremental effectiveness (measured in QALY). Results: Modifying current practice with use of the molecular test resulted in 74% fewer surgeries for benign nodules with no greater number of untreated cancers. Over 5 yr, mean discounted cost estimates were $12,172 for current practice and $10,719 with the molecular test. Current practice and molecular test use produced 4.50 and 4.57 QALY, respectively. Conclusions: Use of this novel molecular test for differential diagnosis of cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules can potentially avoid almost three fourths of currently performed surgeries in patients with benign nodules. Compared with current practice based on cytological findings alone, use of this test may result in lower overall costs and modestly improved quality of life for patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules.",2011-01-07827,21865367,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,Henry Li,2011,/,,No,21865367,"Henry Li; Karen A Robinson; Blair Anton; Ian J Saldanha; Paul W Ladenson; Cost-Effectiveness of a Novel Molecular Test for Cytologically Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules., J Clin Endocrinol Metab, ; ():0021-972X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Molecular test (Afirma Gene Expression Classifier) vs. Current practice based on cytological findings,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-20757.14,United States,2010,-24636.68
8217,Cost-effectiveness of options for the diagnosis of high blood pressure in primary care: a modelling study.,"The diagnosis of hypertension has traditionally been based on blood-pressure measurements in the clinic, but home and ambulatory measurements better correlate with cardiovascular outcome, and ambulatory monitoring is more accurate than both clinic and home monitoring in diagnosing hypertension. We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic strategies for hypertension.We did a Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis. We used a hypothetical primary-care population aged 40 years or older with a screening blood-pressure measurement greater than 140/90 mm Hg and risk-factor prevalence equivalent to the general population. We compared three diagnostic strategies-further blood pressure measurement in the clinic, at home, and with an ambulatory monitor-in terms of lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years, and cost-effectiveness.Ambulatory monitoring was the most cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of hypertension for men and women of all ages. It was cost-saving for all groups (from -?56 [95% CI -105 to -10] in men aged 75 years to -?323 [-389 to -222] in women aged 40 years) and resulted in more quality-adjusted life years for men and women older than 50 years (from 0?006 [0?000 to 0?015] for women aged 60 years to 0?022 [0?012 to 0?035] for men aged 70 years). This finding was robust when assessed with a wide range of deterministic sensitivity analyses around the base case, but was sensitive if home monitoring was judged to have equal test performance to ambulatory monitoring or if treatment was judged effective irrespective of whether an individual was hypertensive.Ambulatory monitoring as a diagnostic strategy for hypertension after an initial raised reading in the clinic would reduce misdiagnosis and save costs.

8219,Screening and Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Patients: A Decision Analysis and Economic Evaluation.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies to reduce morbidity from venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model to compare weekly compression ultrasound screening (screening) plus investigation for clinically suspected DVT (case finding) versus case finding alone; and, a hypothetical program to increase adherence to DVT prevention. Probabilities were derived from a systematic review of VTE in medical-surgical ICU patients. Costs (in 2010 USD) were obtained from hospitals in Canada, Australia, the United States and the medical literature. Analyses were conducted from a societal perspective over a lifetime horizon. Outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the base case, the rate of proximal DVT was 85 per 1000 patients. Screening resulted in 3 fewer pulmonary emboli (PE) than case-finding alone but also 2 additional bleeding episodes, and cost $223,801 per QALY gained. In sensitivity analyses, screening cost less than $50,000 per QALY only if the probability of proximal DVT increased from a baseline of 8.5% to 16%. By comparison, increasing adherence to appropriate pharmacological thromboprophylaxis by 10%, resulted in 16 fewer DVT, 1 fewer PE, 1 additional heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bleeding event, and cost $27,953 per QALY gained. Programs achieving increased adherence to best-practice VTE prevention were cost-effective over a wide range of program costs and were robust in probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Appropriate prophylaxis provides better value in terms of costs and health gains than routine screening for DVT. Resources should be targeted at optimizing thromboprophylaxis.",2011-01-07830,21868500,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,Sachin Sud,2011,/,,No,21868500,"Sachin Sud; Nicole Mittmann; Deborah J Cook; William Geerts; Brian Chan; Peter Dodek; Michael K Gould; Gordon Guyatt; Yaseen Arabi; Robert A Fowler; Canadian Critical Care Trials Gr; E-PROTECT Investigators; Screening and Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism in Critically Ill Patients: A Decision Analysis and Economic Evaluation., Am J Respir Crit Care Med, ; ():1073-449X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Weekly compression ultrasound screening plus investigation for clinically suspected deep vein thrombosis, treated with low molecular-weight heparin on diagnosis via either method vs. Investigation for clinically suspetced deep vein thrombosis, treated with low molecular-weight heparin on diagnosis",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,209093,United States,2010,248172.8
8220,The cost utility of reduction mammaplasty at medium-term follow-up: A prospective study.,"PURPOSE: The effects of reduction mammaplasty (RM) have been proved in several randomised trials. However, publications regarding cost utility are infrequent and lacking with regard to medium-term follow-up. Therefore, we decided to assess the cost utility of RM at 2-5 years' follow-up, when later costs and possible re-operations have been incurred. METHODS: A total of 73 patients had bilateral RM between January 2005 and March 2007 in the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa, Finland. Health-related quality of life was measured with the 15D. Preoperative data were collected with an interview at an appointment and follow-up data by means of a postal survey. Direct hospital costs were obtained from the Ecomed(?) clinical patient administration database (Datawell Ltd., Espoo, Finland). RESULTS: A total of 62 (85%) patients agreed to participate in the study and returned the follow-up questionnaire. The mean follow-up time was 4.0 years (SD 0.53, range 2.3-4.6 years). The mean improvement in the 15D score change was 0.083 (SD 0.081). The mean number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained was 3.052 (SD 3.167, range 2.561-17.553). The mean hospital costs of the intervention were ?3601 (SD 1321), and the mean cost per QALY gained was ?1180. Roughly 76% of the costs were due to the hospital stay during the operation. Eight percent of the costs were incurred more than 6 months after the hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: The cost per QALY gained by RM is low, even when considering later costs caused by possible re-operations, and compares favourably with a number of other surgical procedures.",2011-01-07840,21873127,J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg,Kai M M Saariniemi,2011,/,,No,21873127,"Kai M M Saariniemi; Hannu O M Kuokkanen; Pirjo R?s?nen; Harri Sintonen; Erkki J Tukiainen; The cost utility of reduction mammaplasty at medium-term follow-up: A prospective study., J Plast Reconstr Aesthet Surg, ; ():1748-6815",QALY,Finland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Post-bilateral reduction mammaplasty (RM) at medium-term (2- 5 years post-surgery) follow-up vs. Post-bilateral reduction mammaplasty (RM),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Years,Not Stated,3.00,1180,Euro,2009,1983.74
8221,The Potential Cost-Effectiveness of Amblyopia Screening Programs.,"PURPOSE:To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of amblyopia screening at preschool and kindergarten, the authors compared the costs and benefits of three amblyopia screening scenarios were compared to no screening and to each other: (1) acuity/stereopsis (A/S) screening at kindergarten, (2) A/S screening at preschool and kindergarten, and (3) photoscreening at preschool and A/S screening at kindergarten. METHODS:A probabilistic microsimulation model of amblyopia natural history and response to treatment with screening costs and outcomes estimated from two state programs was programmed. The probability was calculated that no screening and each of the three interventions were most cost-effective per incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and case avoided. RESULTS:Assuming a minimal 0.01 utility loss from monocular vision loss, no screening was most cost-effective with a willingness to pay (WTP) of less than $16,000 per QALY gained. A/S screening at kindergarten alone was most cost-effective at a WTP between $17,000 and $21,000. A/S screening at preschool and kindergarten was most cost-effective at a WTP between $22,000 and $75,000, and photoscreening at preschool and A/S screening at kindergarten was most cost-effective at a WTP greater than $75,000. Cost-effectiveness substantially improved when assuming a greater utility loss. All scenarios were cost-effective when assuming a WTP of $10,500 per case of amblyopia cured.

8226,Quality-of-Life Implications of Immediate Surgery and Watchful Waiting in Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis: A Decision-Analytic Model.,"Background- Traditional management of severe aortic stenosis (AS) is based on delay in aortic valve replacement (AVR) until the development of symptoms. Surgery for asymptomatic AS has been proposed to reduce the small risk of sudden death before AVR and avoid heart failure (HF) after AVR. Because a trial to compare these options is unlikely, we developed a Markov model to inform the choice between immediate surgery and watchful waiting in asymptomatic AS. Methods and Results- We defined health states as preoperative, postoperative, postcomplication, and death. We calculated the implications of watchful waiting, tissue and mechanical AVR-based on risks, transitions, utilities, and cost derived from literature review. Further analyses evaluated situations thought to favor immediate surgery and watchful waiting. Sensitivity analyses were based on the likelihood of preoperative death and HF in follow-up. In the reference case (age, 65 years; post-AVR utility, 0.9; annualized pre-AVR mortality, 1%; and post-AVR HF, 11.3%), the utility of watchful waiting was superior to that of immediate mechanical or tissue AVR (quality-adjusted life-years, 7.4 versus 5.3 versus 5.3, respectively), and the cost was less than immediate surgery.

8227,Quality-of-Life Implications of Immediate Surgery and Watchful Waiting in Asymptomatic Aortic Stenosis: A Decision-Analytic Model.,"Background- Traditional management of severe aortic stenosis (AS) is based on delay in aortic valve replacement (AVR) until the development of symptoms. Surgery for asymptomatic AS has been proposed to reduce the small risk of sudden death before AVR and avoid heart failure (HF) after AVR. Because a trial to compare these options is unlikely, we developed a Markov model to inform the choice between immediate surgery and watchful waiting in asymptomatic AS. Methods and Results- We defined health states as preoperative, postoperative, postcomplication, and death. We calculated the implications of watchful waiting, tissue and mechanical AVR-based on risks, transitions, utilities, and cost derived from literature review. Further analyses evaluated situations thought to favor immediate surgery and watchful waiting. Sensitivity analyses were based on the likelihood of preoperative death and HF in follow-up. In the reference case (age, 65 years; post-AVR utility, 0.9; annualized pre-AVR mortality, 1%; and post-AVR HF, 11.3%), the utility of watchful waiting was superior to that of immediate mechanical or tissue AVR (quality-adjusted life-years, 7.4 versus 5.3 versus 5.3, respectively), and the cost was less than immediate surgery. Sensitivity analyses showed immediate surgery was not likely to be more effective regardless of the yearly probability of post-AVR HF in the watchful waiting group (range, 0% to 80%).

8234,Cost-Effectiveness of Oral Bisphosphonates for Osteoporosis at Different Ages and Levels of Life Expectancy.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of oral bisphosphonate therapy for osteoporosis in women at different ages and life expectancies. DESIGN: A Markov model was used to analyze oral bisphosphonate treatment for 5 years compared to no intervention. Women at each age were divided into life expectancy quartiles: the lowest 1% to 25% (sickest group), the two middle 26% to 75% (average health group), and the highest 76% to 100% of life expectancy (healthiest group). Simulations were performed for hypothetical cohorts at 5-year intervals with starting ages between 50 and 90 and for each life expectancy group and followed for up to 100 years or until death. Data sources included published fracture rates, costs, utility values, and mortality risks. SETTING: Computer simulation using a societal perspective. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of women with various life expectancies beginning osteoporosis treatment between the age of 50 and 90 years. MEASUREMENTS: Cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained for 5 years of bisphosphonate therapy compared to no treatment. Cost-effectiveness was defined at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000. RESULTS: In the healthiest group, all costs were less than $18,000 per QALY. In the median quartiles of life expectancy, lifetime costs per QALY were less than $27,000 for patients at all ages; treatment became cost-saving at a starting age of 75 and remained so through a starting age of 85. Even in the sickest group, although osteoporosis treatment was not cost-saving, it remained cost-effective through a starting age of 90 with lifetime costs of less than $43,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Treatment with an oral bisphosphonate for 5 years was cost-effective for all women, regardless of quartile of life expectancy. Advanced age should not prevent consideration of osteoporosis treatment based on cost effectiveness, and strategies to improve care, such as nurse-led screening programs or electronic medical record tools, are needed.",2011-01-07852,21883116,J Am Geriatr Soc,Annalise N Pham,2011,/,,No,21883116,"Annalise N Pham; Santanu K Datta; Thomas J Weber; Louise C Walter; Cathleen S Col?n-Emeric; Cost-Effectiveness of Oral Bisphosphonates for Osteoporosis at Different Ages and Levels of Life Expectancy., J Am Geriatr Soc, ; ():0002-8614",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral bisphosphonate therapy for 5 years vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,5149,United States,2008,6189.5
8235,Cost-effectiveness analysis of degarelix for advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer.,"Study Type - Therapy (cost-effectiveness analysis) Level of Evidence 2b What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? The European Medicines Evaluation Agency recognised that the principal advantage of degarelix is the avoidance of the transient rise in testosterone. This paper compares the cost-effectiveness of degarelix with the most common treatment in the UK (LHRHa plus short-term anti-androgen) for the management of prostate cancer, focusing on the costs and clinical consequences that might be associated by the avoidance of the transient rise in testosterone. Our analysis suggests that, at the current UK list price, degarelix would not represent good value for money for the NHS. OBJECTIVE: ? To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of degarelix vs luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (triptorelin) plus short-term antiandrogen treatment for advanced prostate cancer. METHODS: ? We developed a decision analytic model based on a clinical trial and literature review. The two interventions evaluated were: (i) monthly injection of degarelix and (ii) 3-monthly triptorelin therapy plus short-term flutamide, cyproterone or bicalutamide treatment. ? The model consisted of a decision tree monitoring a hypothetical cohort of patients aged 70 years from the start of hormonal treatment to the end of the first month, and a Markov model monitoring patients from the end of month 1 for a time horizon of 10 years (i.e. when 96% of patients are assumed to have died). ? The base-case analysis assumed patients present with asymptomatic metastatic prostate cancer. Costs and outcomes were collected over the model time horizon. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. ? Sensitivity analyses (one-way and multi-way) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the uncertainties around the assumptions. RESULTS: ? In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for degarelix vs triptorelin plus antiandrogen was ?59 000 per QALY gained. ? The model was most sensitive to the rate of significant adverse events in the triptorelin plus antiandrogen group. The model was also sensitive to the assumed survival of patients with metastatic prostate cancer and the price of degarelix. ? The results of the probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that there was a low probability (9.6%) of degarelix being the most cost-effective treatment option when a willingness-to-pay threshold of ?30 000 per QALY gained is assumed. CONCLUSION: ? Degarelix is unlikely to be cost-effective compared to triptorelin plus short-term antiandrogen in the management of advanced prostate cancer with respect to the usual thresholds of cost-effectiveness used in the UK: ?20 000-30 000 per QALY gained (used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence).",2011-01-07855,21883830,BJU Int,Lanting Lu,2011,/,,No,21883830,"Lanting Lu; Jaime Peters; Chris Roome; Ken Stein; Cost-effectiveness analysis of degarelix for advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer., BJU Int, ; ():1464-4096",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Monthly injection of degarelix vs. 3-monthly luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue (triptorelin) plus short-term antiandrogen treatment,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,59012,United Kingdom,2009,103078.41
8236,Cost Effectiveness of Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Not on Insulin: Impact of Modelling Assumptions on Recent Canadian Findings.,"Background: Canadian patients, healthcare providers and payers share interest in assessing the value of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) for individuals with type 2 diabetes but not on insulin. Using the UKPDS (UK Prospective Diabetes Study) model, the Canadian Optimal Prescribing and Utilization Service (COMPUS) conducted an SMBG cost-effectiveness analysis. Based on the results, COMPUS does not recommend routine strip use for most adults with type 2 diabetes who are not on insulin. Cost-effectiveness studies require many assumptions regarding cohort, clinical effect, complication costs, etc. The COMPUS evaluation included several conservative assumptions that negatively impacted SMBG cost effectiveness. Objectives: Current objectives were to (i) review key, impactful COMPUS assumptions; (ii) illustrate how alternative inputs can lead to more favourable results for SMBG cost effectiveness; and (iii) provide recommendations for assessing its long-term value. Methods: A summary of COMPUS methods and results was followed by a review of assumptions (for trial-based glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA(1c)] effect, patient characteristics, costs, simulation pathway) and their potential impact. The UKPDS model was used for a 40-year cost-effectiveness analysis of SMBG (1.29 strips per day) versus no SMBG in the Canadian payer setting. COMPUS assumptions for patient characteristics (e.g. HbA(1c) 8.4%), SMBG HbA(1c) advantage (-0.25%) and costs were retained. As with the COMPUS analysis, UKPDS HbA(1c) decay curves were incorporated into SMBG and no-SMBG pathways. An important difference was that SMBG HbA(1c) benefits in the current study could extend beyond the initial simulation period. Sensitivity analyses examined SMBG HbA(1c) advantage, adherence, complication history and cost inputs. Outcomes (discounted at 5%) included QALYs, complication rates, total costs (year 2008 values) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: The base-case ICER was $Can63?664 per QALY gained; approximately 56% of the COMPUS base-case ICER. SMBG was associated with modest risk reductions (0.10-0.70%) for six of seven complications. Assuming an SMBG advantage of -0.30% decreased the current base-case ICER by over $Can10?000 per QALY gained. With adherence of 66% and 87%, ICERs were (respectively) $Can39?231 and $Can54?349 per QALY gained. Incorporating a more representative complication history and 15% complication cost increase resulted in an ICER of $Can49?743 per QALY gained. Conclusions: These results underscore the importance of modelling assumptions regarding the duration of HbA(1c) effect. The current study shares several COMPUS limitations relating to the UKPDS model being designed for newly diagnosed patients, and to randomized controlled trial monitoring rates. Neither study explicitly examined the impact of varying the duration of initial HbA(1c) effects, or of medication or other treatment changes. Because the COMPUS research will potentially influence clinical practice and reimbursement policy in Canada, understanding the impact of assumptions on cost-effectiveness results seems especially important. Demonstrating that COMPUS ICERs were greatly reduced through variations in a small number of inputs may encourage additional clinical research designed to measure SMBG effects within the context of optimal disease management. It may also encourage additional economic evaluations that incorporate lessons learned and best practices for assessing the overall value of SMBG for type 2 diabetes in insulin-naive patients.",2011-01-07860,21892840,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Sandra L Tunis,2011,/,,Yes,21892840,"Sandra L Tunis; Cost Effectiveness of Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) for Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Not on Insulin: Impact of Modelling Assumptions on Recent Canadian Findings., Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; ():1179-1896",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Self-monitoring of blood-glucose vs. Usual care (no self-monitoring of blood-glucose),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,5.00,5.00,63664,Canada,2008,72255.67
8237,Economic Evaluation of Everolimus versus Sorafenib for the Treatment of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma after Failure of First-Line Sunitinib.,"A recent indirect comparison study showed that sunitinib-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) patients treated with everolimus are expected to have improved overall survival outcomes compared to patients treated with sorafenib. This analysis examines the likely cost-effectiveness of everolimus versus sorafenib in this setting from a US payer perspective.A Markov model was developed to simulate a cohort of sunitinib-refractory mRCC patients and to estimate the cost per incremental life-years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Markov states included are stable disease without adverse events, stable disease with adverse events, disease progression, and death. Transition probabilities were estimated using a subset of the RECORD-1 patient population receiving everolimus after sunitinib, and a comparable population receiving sorafenib in a single-arm phase II study. Costs of antitumor therapies were based on wholesale acquisition cost. Health state costs accounted for physician visits, tests, adverse events, postprogression therapy, and end-of-life care. The model extrapolated beyond the trial time horizon for up to 6 years based on published trial data. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.The estimated gain over sorafenib treatment was 1.273 LYs (0.916 QALYs) at an incremental cost of $81,643.

8262,Erlotinib Monotherapy for the Maintenance Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer after Previous Platinum-Containing Chemotherapy: A NICE Single Technology Appraisal.,"The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of erlotinib (Roche) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of erlotinib as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and stable disease following previous treatment with four cycles of platinum-containing therapy. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this appraisal. The ERG reviewed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in two stages and in accordance with the decision problem defined by NICE. The analysis of the submitted models assessed the appropriateness of the approach taken by the manufacturer in modelling the decision problem. Analysis also included reliability of model implementation and the extent of conformity to published standards and prevailing norms of practice within the health economics modelling community. Particular attention was paid to issues likely to have substantial impact on the base-case cost-effectiveness results. Clinical evidence was derived from a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, phase III study designed to address the overall population of NSCLC patients. Outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The recruited population was mainly from outside of Western Europe and no patients in the pivotal trial had received pemetrexed as a first-line therapy, which is now accepted clinical practice in the UK. The evidence considered in this article includes only the population for whom marketing authorizations has been received - that is, patients with stable disease following first-line therapy. The trial reported a small but statistically significant increase in both PFS and OS in patients with stable disease receiving erlotinib compared with placebo. However, no significant difference was identified in OS when patients with non-squamous disease and stable disease were considered as a subgroup. The economic evidence was focussed on the ERG's assessment of three economic models that related to patients with stable disease and compared erlotinib with placebo in the squamous and non-squamous populations and erlotinib with pemetrexed in the non-squamous population. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported by the manufacturer were ?39?936 per QALY gained (stable disease, all); ?35?491 per QALY gained (stable disease, squamous); and ?40?020 per QALY gained (stable disease, non-squamous). In comparison with pemetrexed, in the cases where erlotinib was considered to be superior or equivalent, erlotinib dominated. In the cases where erlotinib was considered to be slightly inferior, then the ICERs ranged between ?91?789 and ?511?351 per QALY gained; these ICERs appear in the south-west corner of a cost-effectiveness plane, i.e. erlotinib is cheaper but less effective than pemetrexed. The ERG recalculated the base-case cost-effectiveness results in the manufacturer's submission, considering nine key areas where corrections and/or adjustments were required, related to time horizon, discounting logic, costs of erlotinib and pemetrexed, cost of second-line chemotherapy, unit costs, utility values, PFS and OS. This resulted in ERG-revised ICERs for the stable disease squamous population of ?44?812 per QALY gained, in the stable disease non-squamous population of ?68?120 per QALY gained, and, when erlotinib was compared with pemetrexed, the result was ?84?029 per QALY gained.

8264,Erlotinib Monotherapy for the Maintenance Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer after Previous Platinum-Containing Chemotherapy: A NICE Single Technology Appraisal.,"The UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of erlotinib (Roche) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of erlotinib as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and stable disease following previous treatment with four cycles of platinum-containing therapy. The Liverpool Reviews and Implementation Group (LRiG) at the University of Liverpool was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this appraisal. The ERG reviewed the clinical- and cost-effectiveness evidence in two stages and in accordance with the decision problem defined by NICE. The analysis of the submitted models assessed the appropriateness of the approach taken by the manufacturer in modelling the decision problem. Analysis also included reliability of model implementation and the extent of conformity to published standards and prevailing norms of practice within the health economics modelling community. Particular attention was paid to issues likely to have substantial impact on the base-case cost-effectiveness results. Clinical evidence was derived from a multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, phase III study designed to address the overall population of NSCLC patients. Outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The recruited population was mainly from outside of Western Europe and no patients in the pivotal trial had received pemetrexed as a first-line therapy, which is now accepted clinical practice in the UK. The evidence considered in this article includes only the population for whom marketing authorizations has been received - that is, patients with stable disease following first-line therapy. The trial reported a small but statistically significant increase in both PFS and OS in patients with stable disease receiving erlotinib compared with placebo. However, no significant difference was identified in OS when patients with non-squamous disease and stable disease were considered as a subgroup. The economic evidence was focussed on the ERG's assessment of three economic models that related to patients with stable disease and compared erlotinib with placebo in the squamous and non-squamous populations and erlotinib with pemetrexed in the non-squamous population. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) reported by the manufacturer were ?39?936 per QALY gained (stable disease, all); ?35?491 per QALY gained (stable disease, squamous); and ?40?020 per QALY gained (stable disease, non-squamous). In comparison with pemetrexed, in the cases where erlotinib was considered to be superior or equivalent, erlotinib dominated. In the cases where erlotinib was considered to be slightly inferior, then the ICERs ranged between ?91?789 and ?511?351 per QALY gained; these ICERs appear in the south-west corner of a cost-effectiveness plane, i.e. erlotinib is cheaper but less effective than pemetrexed. The ERG recalculated the base-case cost-effectiveness results in the manufacturer's submission, considering nine key areas where corrections and/or adjustments were required, related to time horizon, discounting logic, costs of erlotinib and pemetrexed, cost of second-line chemotherapy, unit costs, utility values, PFS and OS. This resulted in ERG-revised ICERs for the stable disease squamous population of ?44?812 per QALY gained, in the stable disease non-squamous population of ?68?120 per QALY gained, and, when erlotinib was compared with pemetrexed, the result was ?84?029 per QALY gained.

The question arises what is a better strategy: target the general population or diabetes patients.A mathematical programming model was developed to calculate optimal allocations for the Dutch population of the following interventions: smoking cessation support, diet and exercise to reduce overweight, statins, and medication to reduce blood pressure. Outcomes were total lifetime health care costs and QALYs. Budget sizes were varied and the division of resources between the general population and diabetes patients was assessed.Full implementation of all interventions resulted in a gain of 560,000 QALY at a cost of ?640 per capita, about ?12,900 per QALY on average. The large majority of these QALY gains could be obtained at incremental costs below ?20,000 per QALY. Low or high budgets (below ?9 or above ?100 per capita) were predominantly spent in the general population. Moderate budgets were mostly spent in diabetes patients.Major health gains can be realized efficiently by offering prevention to both the general and the diabetic population. However, a priori setting a specific distribution of resources is suboptimal. Resource allocation models allow accounting for capacity constraints and program size in addition to efficiency.",2011-01-07876,21974836,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Talitha L Feenstra,2011,9 /,14,Yes,21974836,"Talitha L Feenstra; Pieter M van Baal; Monique O Jacobs-van der Bruggen; Rudolf T Hoogenveen; Geert-Jan Kommer; Caroline A Baan; Targeted versus universal prevention. a resource allocation model to prioritize cardiovascular prevention., Cost Eff Resour Alloc, ; 9 ():1478-7547; 14",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensive lifestyle intervention for persons with extreme overweight (SLIM) vs. Usual care,Not Stated,44 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,19900,Euro,2007,34056.96
8291,Health economic potential of early nutrition programming: a model calculation of long-term reduction in blood pressure and related morbidity costs by use of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-supplemented formula.,"The reported effect sizes of early nutrition programming on long-term health outcomes are often small, and it has been questioned whether early interventions would be worthwhile in enhancing public health.We explored the possible health economic consequences of early nutrition programming by performing a model calculation, based on the only published study currently available for analysis, to evaluate the effects of supplementing infant formula with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) on lowering blood pressure and lowering the risk of hypertension-related diseases in later life.The costs and health effects of LC-PUFA-enriched and standard infant formulas were compared by using a Markov model, including all relevant direct and indirect costs based on German statistics. We assessed the effect size of blood pressure reduction from LC-PUFA-supplemented formula, the long-term persistence of the effect, and the effect of lowered blood pressure on hypertension-related morbidity.The cost-effectiveness analysis showed an increased life expectancy of 1.2 quality-adjusted life-years and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -630 Euros (discounted to present value) for the LC-PUFA formula in comparison with standard formula. LC-PUFA nutrition was the superior strategy even when the blood pressure-lowering effect was reduced to the lower 95% CI.Breastfeeding is the recommended feeding practice, but infants who are not breastfed should receive an appropriate infant formula. Following this model calculation, LC-PUFA supplementation of infant formula represents an economically worthwhile prevention strategy, based on the costs derived from hypertension-linked diseases in later life. However, because our analysis was based on a single randomized controlled trial, further studies are required to verify the validity of this thesis.",2011-01-07877,21974892,Am J Clin Nutr,Niels Straub,2011,94 /,2030S-5S,No,21974892,"Niels Straub; Philipp Grunert; R?diger von Kries; Berthold Koletzko; Health economic potential of early nutrition programming: a model calculation of long-term reduction in blood pressure and related morbidity costs by use of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid-supplemented formula., Am J Clin Nutr, ; 94 ():0002-9165; 2030S-5S",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Supplementing infant formula with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC-PUFA) vs. Standard infant formula,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,Not Stated,-522.91,Euro,2009,-879.08

Population Theoretical population of patients on an intensive care unit.Infections, deaths, costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost effectiveness ratios for alternative strategies, and net monetary benefits.All decolonisation strategies improved health outcomes and reduced costs. Although universal decolonisation (regardless of MRSA status) was the most cost effective in the short term, strategies using screening to target MRSA carriers may be preferred owing to the reduced risk of selecting for resistance. Among such targeted strategies, universal admission and weekly screening with polymerase chain reaction coupled with decolonisation using nasal mupirocin was the most cost effective. This finding was robust to the size of intensive care units, prevalence of MRSA on admission, proportion of patients classified as high risk, and precise value of willingness to pay for health benefits. All strategies using isolation but not decolonisation improved health outcomes but costs were increased. When the prevalence of MRSA on admission to the intensive care unit was 5% and the willingness to pay per QALY gained was between ?20,000 (?23,000; $32,000) and ?30,000, the best such strategy was to isolate only those patients at high risk of carrying MRSA (either pre-emptively or after identification by admission and weekly screening for MRSA using chromogenic agar). Universal admission and weekly screening using polymerase chain reaction based detection of MRSA coupled with isolation was unlikely to be cost effective unless prevalence was high (10% of patients colonised with MRSA on admission).MRSA control strategies that use decolonisation are likely to be cost saving in an intensive care unit setting provided resistance is lacking, and combining universal screening using polymerase chain reaction with decolonisation is likely to represent good value for money if untargeted decolonisation is considered unacceptable.
