6201,Prospective evaluation of a Colorectal Cancer Nurse Follow-up Clinic,"Introduction: Colorectal Nurse Specialist (CNS) clinics for post-operative follow-up of colorectal cancer aim to maintain clinical efficacy while reducing costs. We prospectively studied the efficacy and financial implications of this clinic. Method: This was a prospective study of all patients attending CNS clinics over 3 years. A lower risk protocol for Dukes' A patients and a higher risk protocol for Dukes' B, C and D patients was used over 3 and 5 years respectively. Department of Health Pricing Charts were used to cost the follow up protocols and adjustment was performed to calculate the cost of each QALY gained. Results: 193 patients entered into this nurse follow up clinic protocol between 2005 and 2007. Patients were Dukes' stage A:13.0%, B:35.8%, C:36.3% and D:9.3%. Ninety-seven percent underwent curative treatment and 2.6% had palliative treatment. Twenty-one percent of patients developed recurrent disease. Overall actuarial 5-year survival was 80%, recurrences had a 30% 5-year actuarial survival. The total cost per patient for three years follow-up was pound1506 and pound1179 for lower risk rectal and non-rectal cancers respectively. The adjusted cost for each QALY gained for lower risk tumours was pound1914. Total cost per patient with higher risk tumours was pound1814 and pound1487 for rectal and non-rectal tumours respectively. The adjusted cost for each QALY gained was pound2180 for higher risk tumours. Conclusions: This clinic demonstrated cost effective detection of recurrent disease. CT was the most sensitive alert test. As all recurrences were detected within 4 years, we suggest that this is the indicated time to follow-up.",2009-01-05523,19674021,Colorectal Dis,S Jeyarajah,2009,/,,No,19674021,"S Jeyarajah; Kj Adams; Lynne Higgins; Suzanne Ryan; Ajm Leather; S Papagrigoriadis; Prospective evaluation of a Colorectal Cancer Nurse Follow-up Clinic, Colorectal Dis, 2009-Aug-05; ():1463-1318",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Colorectal follow-up with nurse at a special clinic vs. No follow-up treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,1914,United Kingdom,2006,4529.46
6202,Prospective randomized trial using cost-utility analysis of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute gallbladder disease,"BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled trial compared the cost-utility of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy with that for conventional management of newly diagnosed acute gallbladder disease. METHODS: Adults admitted to hospital with a first episode of biliary colic or acute cholecystitis were randomized to an early intervention group (36 patients, operation within 72 h of admission) or a conventional group (36, elective cholecystectomy 3 months later). Costs were measured from a National Health Service and societal perspective. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains were calculated 1 month after surgery. RESULTS: The mean(s.d.) total costs of care were pound 5911(2445) for the early group and pound 6132(3244) for the conventional group (P = 0.928), Mean(s.d.) societal costs were pound 1322(1402) and pound 1461(1532) for the early and conventional groups respectively (P = 0.732). Visual analogue scale scores of health were 72.94 versus 84.63 (P = 0.012) and the mean(s.d.) QALY gain was 0.85(0.26) versus 0.93(0.13) respectively (P = 0.262). The incremental cost per additional QALY gained favoured conventional management at a cost of pound 3810 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: In this pragmatic trial, the cost-utilities of both the early and conventional approaches were similar, but the incremental cost per additional QALY gained favoured conventional management.",2009-01-05524,19672930,J Clin Psychopharmacol,D A L Macafee,2009,96 / 9,1031-40,No,19672930,"D A L Macafee; D J Humes; G Bouliotis; I J Beckingham; D K Whynes; D N Lobo; Prospective randomized trial using cost-utility analysis of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute gallbladder disease, J Clin Psychopharmacol, 2009-Sep; 96(9):0271-0749; 1031-40",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 72 hours of admission vs. Conventional management (laparoscopic cholecystectomy within 3 months of admission),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Month,Not Stated,Not Stated,2762.5,United Kingdom,2007,6903.38
6203,Cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab compared with pegaptanib in neovascular age-related macular degeneration,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab compared with pegaptanib in the treatment of patients with minimally classic/occult neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), from a societal perspective in Spain. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model with five states defined by visual acuity (VA) in the better-seeing eye (Snellen scale): VA >20/40, </=20/40 to >20/80, </=20/80 to >20/200, </=20/200 to >20/400, </=20/400, and an additional death state. Two cohorts of patients were distributed along the VA states, and treated with either ranibizumab or pegaptanib. Transition probabilities assigned for movement between these states with both drugs were obtained from published randomized clinical trials. Medical costs related to AMD treatment and follow-up, medical costs related to AMD comorbidities, and non-medical-related costs were taken into account. Costs (2008 Euro), health outcomes (Quality-adjusted life years-QALYs), both discounted at a 3.5% annual rate, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER: <euro>/QALY), were determined for a lifetime horizon in the base case analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore different scenarios and assumptions in the model. RESULTS: Treating patients with varying degrees of visual impairment with monthly ranibizumab instead of pegaptanib was <euro>71,206 more costly and provided 2.437 additional QALYs (<euro>29,224/QALY). When administered on an as-needed basis, as in the Prospective Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging of Patients with Neovascular AMD Treated with Intraocular Ranibizumab (PrONTO) trial, the cost per QALY gained with ranibizumab was reduced to <euro>4,623. CONCLUSIONS: The cost per QALY gained with monthly ranibizumab compared with pegaptanib in the minimally classic/occult neovascular AMD population is just below the <euro>30,000 threshold below which new drugs are sometimes regarded as cost-effective strategies in Spain. In this model, the key variables with greater impact on the cost-effectiveness results were the selected time horizon and the chosen extrapolation method, the source for data on pegaptanib efficacy and the number of ranibizumab injections. When administered on an as-needed basis, ranibizumab was a cost-effective strategy compared to pegaptanib in this population.",2009-01-05530,19669678,Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,Luis Hernández-Pastor,2009,/,,No,19669678,"Luis Hernández-Pastor; Ana Ortega; Alfredo García-Layana; Joaquín Giráldez; Cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab compared with pegaptanib in neovascular age-related macular degeneration, Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol, 2009-Aug-11; ():1435-702X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Monthly ranibizumab vs. Pegaptanib,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,29224,Euro,2008,51730.33

6206,Prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer: evaluation of National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group CO.17 trial,"BACKGROUND: The National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group CO.17 study showed that patients with advanced colorectal cancer had improved overall survival when cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting antibody, was given in addition to best supportive care. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using prospectively collected resource utilization and health utility data for patients in the CO.17 study who received cetuximab plus best supportive care (N = 283) or best supportive care alone (N = 274). METHODS: Direct medical resource utilization data were collected, including medications, physician visits, toxicity management, blood products, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations. Mean survival times for the study arms were calculated for the entire population and for the subset of patients with wild-type KRAS tumors over an 18- to 19-month period. All costs were presented in 2007 Canadian dollars. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to determine the robustness of the results. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were determined. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and the incremental cost-utility ratios were estimated by use of a nonparametric bootstrapping method (with 1000 iterations). RESULTS: For the entire study population, the mean improvement in overall and quality-adjusted survival with cetuximab was 0.12 years and 0.08 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), respectively. The incremental cost with cetuximab compared with best supportive care was $23,969. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $199,742 per life-year gained (95% CI = $125,973 to $652,492 per life-year gained) and the incremental cost-utility ratio was $299,613 per QALY gained (95% CI = $187,440 to $898,201 per QALY gained). For patients with wild-type KRAS tumors, the incremental cost with cetuximab was $33,617 and mean gains in overall and quality-adjusted survival were 0.28 years and 0.18 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $120,061 per life-year gained (95% CI = $88,679 to $207,075 per life-year gained) and the incremental cost-utility ratio was $186,761 per QALY gained (95% CI = $130,326 to $334,940 per QALY gained). In a sensitivity analysis, cetuximab cost and patient survival were the only variables that influenced cost-effectiveness.

6208,Hylan G-F 20 has better pain relief and cost-effectiveness than sodium hyaluronate in treating early osteoarthritic knees in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Intra-articular injection of hyaluronan (hyaluronic acid; HA) products is available to treat early osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee in Taiwan. We tested whether HA products with different molecular weights have significantly different effects on clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with mild to moderate OA of both knees underwent five weekly intra-articular injections of sodium hyaluronate (Artz) in one knee and three weekly intra-articular injections of chemically cross-linked Hylan G-F 20 (Synvisc) in the other. Visual analog scale (VAS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Lequesne's index, and Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) knee scores were compared initially and at the last injection, and at 8, 12, 16, 20, and 26 weeks after the first injection. RESULTS: VAS, WOMAC, WOMAC-A1 (pain when walking on a flat surface) scores before week 16, HSS scores before week 12, and Lequesne's index scores except at week 26 all showed that HA significantly improved the scores time-dependently. In VAS scores, Synvisc showed better improvement before week 20, while this effect appeared at week 12 for the WOMAC-A1 scores. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Program, of the patient, and both of these was lower for Synvisc, which also reduced the number of additional hospital visits for injections by two.

6210,Laparoscopic fundoplication compared with medical management for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease: cost effectiveness study,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the long term costs, health benefits, and cost effectiveness of laparoscopic surgery compared with those of continued medical management for patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). DESIGN: We estimated resource use and costs for the first year on the basis of data from the REFLUX trial. A Markov model was used to extrapolate cost and health benefit over a lifetime using data collected in the REFLUX trial and other sources. PARTICIPANTS: The model compared laparoscopic surgery and continued proton pump inhibitors in male patients aged 45 and stable on GORD medication. INTERVENTION: Laparoscopic surgery versus continued medical management. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We estimated quality adjusted life years and GORD related costs to the health service over a lifetime. Sensitivity analyses considered other plausible scenarios, in particular size and duration of treatment effect and the GORD symptoms of patients in whom surgery is unsuccessful. Main results The base case model indicated that surgery is likely to be considered cost effective on average with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of pound2648 (euro3110; US$4385) per quality adjusted life year and that the probability that surgery is cost effective is 0.94 at a threshold incremental cost effectiveness ratio of pound20 000. The results were sensitive to some assumptions within the extrapolation modelling. CONCLUSION: Surgery seems to be more cost effective on average than medical management in many of the scenarios examined in this study. Surgery might not be cost effective if the treatment effect does not persist over the long term, if patients who return to medical management have poor health related quality of life, or if proton pump inhibitors were cheaper. Further follow-up of patients from the REFLUX trial may be valuable.

OBJECTIVE: In a decision analysis, the cost-effectiveness of different strategies for managing solitary, asymptomatic pancreatic cystic neoplasm were compared. INTERVENTION: Three strategies were examined in a Markov model with a third-party-payer perspective. In strategy I, the natural history of the lesion was followed without any specific intervention. In strategy II, an aggressive surgical approach was considered in that all patients were considered for resection. In strategy III, an initial EUS-guided FNA with cyst fluid analysis was performed for risk stratification, and patients with mucinous cysts were considered for resection. Transitional probabilities, discounted cost, and utility values to estimate quality-adjusted life years were obtained from published information.

RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, strategy III yielded the highest quality-adjusted life years with an acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. In a Monte Carlo analysis, the relative risk of patients developing unresectable pancreatic cancer was decreased in strategy III compared to the other strategies.

6213,Exenatide versus insulin glargine: a cost-effectiveness evaluation in patients with Type 2 diabetes in Switzerland,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with exenatide versus insulin glargine as ""add-on"" treatments to oral therapy in individuals with Type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with combination oral agents in the Swiss setting. METHODS: A computer simulation model of diabetes was used to project complications, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct medical costs over a 35-year time horizon. Cohort characteristics and treatment effect data were derived from a 26-week randomized clinical trial comparing exenatide and insulin glargine. Modeled treatment effects included reductions in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) by -0.99% and -1.07% and in body mass index (BMI) by -0.80 and +0.55 kg/m2 with exenatide and insulin glargine respectively. Changes in systolic blood pressure and serum lipid levels were also captured. Simulations incorporated published quality of life utilities and Swiss costs from 2006. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of projected outcomes. Future clinical and economic outcomes were discounted at 2.5% per annum. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis exenatide was associated with comparable life expectancy (11,549 years versus 11,468 years) and an improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.43 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus insulin glargine over a 35-year time horizon. Exenatide was associated with a reduced cumulative incidence of most diabetes-related complications including an absolute reduction in myocardial infarction by 0.28%. Assuming an annual treatment cost of CHF 2,797.74 for exenatide, direct costs increased by CHF 8,378 per patient over the 35-year time horizon compared to insulin glargine. The resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CHF 19,450 per QALY gained for exenatide versus insulin glargine. CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide was associated with comparable life expectancy and an improvement in quality-adjusted life expectancy versus insulin glargine over a 35-year time horizon. Based on current standards exenatide would be a cost-effective treatment alternative to insulin glargine in Switzerland for Type 2 diabetes patients inadequately controlled on oral therapy.",2009-01-05569,19640359,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,M Brändle,2009,47 / 8,501-15,No,19640359,"M Brändle; K M Erny-Albrecht; G Goodall; G A Spinas; P Streit; W J Valentine; Exenatide versus insulin glargine: a cost-effectiveness evaluation in patients with Type 2 diabetes in Switzerland, Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther, 2009-Aug; 47(8):0946-1965; 501-15",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exenatide vs. Insulin glargine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,2.50,2.50,19450,Switzerland,2006,19938.79

Design Cost analysis within multicentre individually randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Grampian, Tayside, and Nottingham. PARTICIPANTS: 4201 women with low grade abnormalities. INTERVENTIONS: Cytological surveillance or referral to colposcopy for biopsy and recall if necessary or referral to colposcopy with immediate treatment based on colposcopic appearance. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Data on resource use collected from participants throughout the duration of the trial (36 months), enabling the estimation of both the direct (health care) and indirect (time and travel) costs of management. Quality of life assessed at recruitment and at 12, 18, 24, and 30 months, using the EQ-5D instrument. Economic outcomes expressed as costs per case of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (grade II or worse) detected, by trial arm, as confirmed at exit, and cost utility ratios (cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained) for the three pairwise comparisons of trial arms. RESULTS: The mean three year discounted costs of surveillance, immediate treatment, and biopsy and recall were pound150.20 (euro177, $249), pound240.30 (euro283, $415), and pound241.10 (euro284, $4000), respectively, viewed from the health service perspective. From the social perspective, mean discounted costs were pound204.40 (euro241, $339), pound339.90 (euro440, $563), and pound327.50 (euro386, $543), respectively. Estimated at the means, the incremental cost effectiveness ratios indicated that immediate treatment was dominated by the other two management methods, although it did offer the lowest cost per case of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia detected and treated. The pronounced skews in the distributions indicated that probabilistic uncertainty analysis would offer more meaningful estimates of cost effectiveness. The observed differences in the cost effectiveness ratios between trial arms were not significant.

The potential benefit and economic consequences of focused or unfocused AED deployment are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: All cardiac arrests in public in Copenhagen, Denmark, from 1994 through 2005 were geographically located, as were 104 public AEDs placed by local initiatives. In accordance with European Resuscitation Council and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, areas with a high incidence of cardiac arrests were defined as those with 1 cardiac arrest every 2 or 5 years, respectively. There were 1274 cardiac arrests in public locations. According to the European Resuscitation Council or AHA guidelines, AEDs needed to be deployed in 1.2% and 10.6% of the city area, providing coverage for 19.5% (n=249) and 66.8% (n=851) of all cardiac arrests, respectively.

Areas with major train stations (1.8 arrests every 5 years per area), large public squares, and pedestrianized areas (0.6 arrests every 5 years per area) were main predictors of frequent cardiac arrests. CONCLUSIONS: To achieve wide AED coverage, AEDs need to be more widely distributed than recommended by the European Resuscitation Council guidelines but consistent with the American Heart Association guidelines. Strategic placement of AEDs is pivotal for public-access defibrillation, whereas with unguided initiatives, AEDs are likely to be placed inappropriately.",2009-01-05574,19635969,Circulation,Fredrik Folke,2009,120 / 6,510-7,No,19635969,"Fredrik Folke; Freddy Knudsen Lippert; Søren Loumann Nielsen; Gunnar Hilmar Gislason; Morten Lock Hansen; Tina Ken Schramm; Rikke Sørensen; Emil Loldrup Fosbøl; Søren Skøtt Andersen; Søren Rasmussen; Lars Køber; Christian Torp-Pedersen; Location of cardiac arrest in a city center: strategic placement of automated external defibrillators in public locations, Circulation, 2009-Aug-11; 120(6):0009-7322; 510-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Unguided automated external defibrillator (AED) coverage for all of Copenhagen vs. Existing mergency medical system (EMS) of public access automated external defibrillator (AED),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Years,3.00,3.00,108700,United States,2008,130665.88
6224,The Economic Value of Innovative Treatments over the Product Life Cycle: The Case of Targeted Trastuzumab Therapy for Breast Cancer,"ABSTRACT Objective: Pharmacoeconomic analyses typically project the expected cost-effectiveness of a new product for a specific indication. This analysis develops a dynamic life-cycle model to conduct a multiindication evaluation using the case of trastuzumab licensed in the United States for both early-stage and metastatic (or late-stage) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer therapy (early breast cancer [EBC]; metastatic breast cancer [MBC]), approved in 2006 and 1998, respectively. Methods: This dynamic model combined information on expected incremental cost-utility ratios for specific indications with an epidemiologically based projection of utilization by indication over the product life cycle-from 1998 to 2016. Net economic value was estimated as the cumulative quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained over the life cycle multiplied by a societal valuation of health gains ($/QALY) minus cumulative net direct treatment costs. Sensitivity analyses were performed under a range of assumptions. Results: We projected that the annual number of EBC patients receiving trastuzumab will be more than three times that of MBC by 2016, in part because adjuvant treatment reduces the future incidence of MBC. Over this life cycle, the estimated overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $35,590/QALY with a total of 432,547 discounted QALYs gained. Under sensitivity analyses, the overall ICER varied from $21,000 to $53,000/QALY, and the projected net economic value resulting from trastuzumab treatment ranged from $6.2 billion to $49.5 billion. Conclusions: Average ICERs for multiindication compounds can increase or decrease over the product life cycle. In this example, the projected overall life-cycle ICER for trastuzumab was less than one half of that in the initial indication.

6227,Cost-effectiveness of diabetes self-management programs in community primary care settings,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of diabetes self-management programs in real-world community primary care settings. Estimates incorporated lifetime reductions in disease progression, costs of adverse events, and increases in quality of life. METHODS: Clinical results and costs were based on programs of the Diabetes Initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, implemented in primary care and community settings in disadvantaged areas with notable health disparities. Program results were used as inputs to a Markov simulation model to estimate the long-term effects of self-management interventions. A health systems perspective was adopted. RESULTS: The simulation model estimates that the intervention does reduce discounted lifetime treatment and complication costs by $3385, but this is more than offset by the $15,031 cost of implementing the intervention and maintaining its effects in subsequent years. The intervention is estimated to reduce long-term complications, leading to an increase in remaining life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is $39,563/QALY, well below a common benchmark of $50,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the model's estimates under various alternative assumptions. The model generally predicts acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios. CONCLUSIONS: Self-management programs for type 2 diabetes are cost-effective from a health systems perspective when the cost savings due to reductions in long-term complications are recognized. These findings may justify increased reimbursement for effective self-management programs in diverse settings.",2009-01-05582,19622716,Diabetes Educ,Carol A Brownson,2009,35 / 5,761-9,No,19622716,"Carol A Brownson; Thomas J Hoerger; Edwin B Fisher; Kerry E Kilpatrick; Cost-effectiveness of diabetes self-management programs in community primary care settings, Diabetes Educ, 2009 Sep-Oct; 35(5):0145-7217; 761-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Diabetes Initiative Program (more self-management) vs. No intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,39563,United States,2007,49383.82
6228,Medico-economic evaluation of infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis--prospective French study of a cohort of 635 patients monitored for two years,"OBJECTIVES: To perform, in real conditions of prescription, the medico-economic evaluation of infliximab in severe RA. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of the annual costs was done with a comparison between the previous and the following year under infliximab. The effectiveness, determined from the HAQ, was expressed in clinically significant units and in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The incremental net benefit (INB), defined as willingness to pay (lambda), was used to express the results. RESULTS: A cohort of 635 patients was formed. Before the use of infliximab, after 1 and 2 years, the mean annual cost per patient for the care of RA was 9832, 27,723 and 46,704 euro, respectively. Among the direct costs, infliximab accounts for 21,182 euro for the first year. The distribution of the different costs was similar after 2 years. By using the INB, the difference before and after 1 year under infliximab is significant, on average by 1.86 (S.E.M. = 0.76) when the effectiveness is expressed in clinically significant units. For severe HAQ, lambda is 9841 euro (18,593 for all HAQ). When it is expressed in QALYs, also for severe HAQ, lambda > 100,000 euro. This can be explained by a short follow-up although severe complication of RA appears later. CONCLUSION: An evaluation of the more long-term costs is required in order to determine whether there are any full economic benefits with this treatment.",2009-01-05586,19620209,Rheumatology (Oxford),Jacques Sany,2009,48 / 10,1236-41,No,19620209,"Jacques Sany; Jean-David Cohen; Christophe Combescure; Marie-Cécile Bozonnat; Françoise Roch-Bras; Georges Lafon; Jean-Pierre Daurès; Medico-economic evaluation of infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis--prospective French study of a cohort of 635 patients monitored for two years, Rheumatology (Oxford), 2009-Oct; 48(10):1462-0324; 1236-41",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with infliximab vs. Treatment without infliximab,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,18593,Euro,2003,29606.21
6229,A cost-effectiveness analysis of a community-based diabetes prevention program in Sweden,"OBJECTIVES: Lifestyle changes to prevent type 2 diabetes among high-risk persons have been shown to be cost-effective. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of a community-based program promoting general population lifestyle changes to prevent diabetes. METHODS: The 10-year program was implemented in three municipalities in Sweden. Effectiveness was measured with a quasiexperimental cohort design, that is, risk factor levels in a population group aged 36-56 years at baseline and 8-10 years later (2,149 men; 3,092 women) in the program municipalities and a control area were compared. The incremental cost-utility analysis included future diabetes and cardiovascular disease-related health effects and societal costs (discounted 3 percent), estimated by a Markov model. RESULTS: In all areas, risk factor levels increased during follow-up, leading to increased societal costs of between SEK40,000 and 90,000 (1 Euro 2004 = SEK9.13; 1 US$ = SEK 7.35) and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) losses between 0.12 and 0.48 per individual. Compared with the control area, the cost increases and QALY losses for women were more favorable in two program areas but less favorable in one, and less favorable for men in both areas (data unavailable for one municipality). The findings indicate that the program was cost-effective in only two female study groups. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicting results on the cost-effectiveness of the program were obtained.

6239,Cost-effectiveness of population-based BRCA1/2 testing and ovarian cancer prevention for Ashkenazi Jews: a call for dialogue,"PURPOSE: About half of unaffected BRCA1/2 carriers have a negative family history, confounding efforts toward presymptomatic carrier identification. Ovarian cancer is preventable for known carriers but is otherwise highly lethal. Cost-effectiveness and gains in life expectancy are important factors in evaluating the desirability of population-based genetic screening, currently the only viable strategy to identify carriers with unrevealing family histories. METHODS: Cost-utility analysis for a population-based genetic screening program offered to American Ashkenazi Jewish women aged 35-55 years measuring cancer incidence, life expectancy, and cost. RESULTS: Our model predicts that a genetic screening program would result in 2811 fewer cases of ovarian cancer, with a life expectancy gain of 1.83 quality-adjusted life years among carriers. At a cost of 460 USD for founder mutation testing, the cost of the program is 8300 USD(discounted) per year of quality-adjusted life gained. CONCLUSION: In populations with a high prevalence of BRCA1/2 founder mutations, genetic screening may be cost-effective when compared with recommended public health interventions such as mammographic screening. We advocate the initiation of a dialogue among Jewish stakeholders, genetics professionals, and public health leaders to determine whether a population-based BRCA1/2 genetic screening program should be pursued.",2009-01-05599,19606050,Genet Med,Wendy S Rubinstein,2009,11 / 9,629-39,No,19606050,"Wendy S Rubinstein; Hongmei Jiang; Lisa Dellefave; Alfred W Rademaker; Cost-effectiveness of population-based BRCA1/2 testing and ovarian cancer prevention for Ashkenazi Jews: a call for dialogue, Genet Med, 2009-Sep; 11(9):1098-3600; 629-39",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Population-based BRCA 1/2 testing measuring cancer incidence, life expectancy and costs vs. No intervention",Not Stated,55 Years,35 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,8300,United States,2007,10360.33
6240,Cost effectiveness of COX 2 selective inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs alone or in combination with a proton pump inhibitor for people with osteoarthritis,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost effectiveness of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX 2) selective inhibitors and traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the addition of proton pump inhibitors to these treatments, for people with osteoarthritis. DESIGN: An economic evaluation using a Markov model and data from a systematic review was conducted. Estimates of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events were based on data from three large randomised controlled trials, and observational data were used for sensitivity analyses. Efficacy benefits from treatment were estimated from a meta-analysis of trials reporting total Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index score. Other model inputs were obtained from the relevant literature. The model was run for a hypothetical population of people with osteoarthritis. Subgroup analyses were conducted for people at high risk of gastrointestinal or cardiovascular adverse events. Comparators Licensed COX 2 selective inhibitors (celecoxib and etoricoxib) and traditional NSAIDs (diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen) for which suitable data were available were compared. Paracetamol was also included, as was the possibility of adding a proton pump inhibitor (omeprazole) to each treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measure was cost effectiveness, which was based on quality adjusted life years gained. Quality adjusted life year scores were calculated from pooled estimates of efficacy and major adverse events (that is, dyspepsia; symptomatic ulcer; complicated gastrointestinal perforation, ulcer, or bleed; myocardial infarction; stroke; and heart failure). RESULTS: Addition of a proton pump inhibitor to both COX 2 selective inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs was highly cost effective for all patient groups considered (incremental cost effectiveness ratio less than pound1000 (euro1175, $1650)). This finding was robust across a wide range of effectiveness estimates if the cheapest proton pump inhibitor was used. In our base case analysis, adding a proton pump inhibitor to a COX 2 selective inhibitor (used at the lowest licensed dose) was a cost effective option, even for patients at low risk of gastrointestinal adverse events (incremental cost effectiveness ratio approximately pound10 000). Uncertainties around relative adverse event rates meant relative cost effectiveness for individual COX 2 selective inhibitors and traditional NSAIDs was difficult to determine. CONCLUSIONS: Prescribing a proton pump inhibitor for people with osteoarthritis who are taking a traditional NSAID or COX 2 selective inhibitor is cost effective.

6245,Cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands, low cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates might limit the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against the human papillomavirus (HPV). We examined the effect on cervical cancer incidence and mortality of adding HPV vaccination to the current Dutch cervical cancer screening situation and calculated the cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Costs and effects were estimated under favorable assumptions (ie, that HPV vaccination provides lifelong protection against 70% of all cervical cancers, has no side effects, and is administered to all women regardless of their risk of cervical cancer) by using the microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) model. The impact of changes in the price of vaccination, number of booster vaccinations, vaccination attendance rate, vaccination efficacy, cervical cancer incidence level, and quality-of-life assumptions was investigated in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Using the current price of euro118 per vaccine dose and with discounting of costs and effects at an annual rate of 3%, adding HPV vaccination to the current Dutch screening situation had a cost-effectiveness ratio of euro53 500 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The threshold price per vaccine dose at which the cost-effectiveness of vaccination would correspond to an acceptability threshold of euro20 000 per QALY gained was euro40. With the addition of one or more (up to four) booster vaccinations during a lifetime, this threshold price decreased to euro33 for one booster (to euro16 for four boosters). With a doubling of the cervical cancer incidence level, the cost-effectiveness ratio was euro24 400 per QALY gained and the maximum price per dose at threshold of euro20 000 was euro97. All threshold prices were lower under less favorable effectiveness assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: In the Netherlands, HPV vaccination is not cost-effective even under favorable assumptions. To become cost-effective, the vaccine price would have to be decreased considerably, depending on the effectiveness of the vaccine.",2009-01-05618,19571256,J Natl Cancer Inst,Inge M C M de Kok,2009,101 / 15,1083-92,No,19571256,"Inge M C M de Kok; Marjolein van Ballegooijen; J Dik F Habbema; Cost-effectiveness analysis of human papillomavirus vaccination in the Netherlands, J Natl Cancer Inst, 2009-Aug-05; 101(15):0027-8874; 1083-92",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vaccinated for human papilloma virus (HPV) plus screening for cervical cancer vs. Cervical cancer screening only,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,53500,Euro,2007,91560.18
6246,Assessing the value of atomoxetine in treating children and adolescents with ADHD in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Economic evaluation of healthcare technologies is becoming increasingly relevant, enabling decision makers to assess and compare treatments within the context of costs and outcomes. Moreover, it is increasingly important for clinicians and prescribers to have some understanding of economic evaluation. For attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), economic evaluations have largely focused on pharmacotherapy, and results indicate that such treatments are cost-effective compared with other interventions. AIMS: This review provides an overview of ADHD, its consequences and pharmacotherapy; describes the principles of health economic analysis, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and a cost-effectiveness model of atomoxetine for ADHD treatment; and outlines guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence on ADHD pharmacotherapy. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of atomoxetine for children with ADHD in the UK was compared with treatment alternatives using an economic model with Markov processes. The model evaluated atomoxetine in five patient subgroups according to treatment history and comorbidities precluding stimulants. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated and compared between treatment algorithms. The Markov process incorporated 18 health states, representing a range of outcomes across the treatments. Utility values were derived from a survey of 83 parents of children with ADHD, and treatment efficacy and safety were based on a review of controlled clinical trials and literature, and validated by international experts. Costs and outcomes were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation over 1-year. RESULTS: Atomoxetine was a cost-effective treatment across the whole ADHD population, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from pound 11,500 to pound 15,900 per QALY, compared with alternative pharmacotherapies, which are within UK and rest of Europe acceptability limits. Higher utility values achieved treating ADHD with atomoxetine, compensate for the relatively higher acquisition cost compared with stimulants.

6249,Assessing the value of atomoxetine in treating children and adolescents with ADHD in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Economic evaluation of healthcare technologies is becoming increasingly relevant, enabling decision makers to assess and compare treatments within the context of costs and outcomes. Moreover, it is increasingly important for clinicians and prescribers to have some understanding of economic evaluation. For attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), economic evaluations have largely focused on pharmacotherapy, and results indicate that such treatments are cost-effective compared with other interventions. AIMS: This review provides an overview of ADHD, its consequences and pharmacotherapy; describes the principles of health economic analysis, health-related quality of life (HRQL) and a cost-effectiveness model of atomoxetine for ADHD treatment; and outlines guidance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence on ADHD pharmacotherapy. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of atomoxetine for children with ADHD in the UK was compared with treatment alternatives using an economic model with Markov processes. The model evaluated atomoxetine in five patient subgroups according to treatment history and comorbidities precluding stimulants. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated and compared between treatment algorithms. The Markov process incorporated 18 health states, representing a range of outcomes across the treatments. Utility values were derived from a survey of 83 parents of children with ADHD, and treatment efficacy and safety were based on a review of controlled clinical trials and literature, and validated by international experts. Costs and outcomes were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation over 1-year. RESULTS: Atomoxetine was a cost-effective treatment across the whole ADHD population, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from pound 11,500 to pound 15,900 per QALY, compared with alternative pharmacotherapies, which are within UK and rest of Europe acceptability limits.

6253,Relative cost-effectiveness of treatments for adolescent depression: 36-week results from the TADS randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: The cost-effectiveness of three active interventions for major depression in adolescents was compared after 36 weeks of treatment in the Treatment of Adolescents with Depression Study. METHOD: Outpatients aged 12 to 18 years with a primary diagnosis of major depression participated in a randomized controlled trial conducted at 13 U.S. academic and community clinics from 2000 to 2004. Three hundred twenty-seven participants randomized to 1 of 3 active treatment arms, fluoxetine alone (n = 109), cognitive-behavioral therapy (n = 111) alone, or their combination (n = 107), were evaluated for a 3-month acute treatment and a 6-month continuation/maintenance treatment period. Costs of services received for the 36 weeks were estimated and examined in relation to the number of depression-free days and quality-adjusted life-years. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were also generated. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess treatment differences on the quality-adjusted life-years and cost-effectiveness measures. RESULTS: Cognitive-behavioral therapy was the most costly treatment component (mean $1,787 [in monotherapy] and $1,833 [in combination therapy], median $1,923 [for both]). Reflecting higher direct and indirect costs associated with psychiatric hospital use, the costs of services received outside Treatment of Adolescents with Depression Study in fluoxetine-treated patients (mean $5,382, median $2,341) were significantly higher than those in participants treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (mean $3,102, median $1,373) or combination (mean $2,705, median $927). Accordingly, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves indicate that combination treatment is highly likely (>90%) to be more cost-effective than fluoxetine alone at 36 weeks. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is not likely to be more cost-effective than fluoxetine.

6255,Clinical and cost effectiveness of services for early diagnosis and intervention in dementia,"BACKGROUND: This paper analyses the costs and benefits of commissioning memory services for early diagnosis and intervention for dementia. METHOD: A model was developed to examine potential public and private savings associated with delayed admissions to care homes in England as a result of the commissioning of memory services. FINDINGS: The new services would cost around pound sterling 220 million extra per year nationally in England. The estimated savings if 10% of care home admissions were prevented would by year 10 be around pound sterling 120 million in public expenditure (social care) and pound sterling 125 million in private expenditure (service users and their families), a total of pound sterling 245 million. Under a 20% reduction, the annual cost would within around 6 years be offset by the savings to public funds alone. In 10 years all people with dementia will have had the chance to be seen by the new services. A gain of between 0.01 and 0.02 QALYs per person year would be sufficient to render the service cost-effective (in terms of positive net present value). These relatively small improvements seem very likely to be achievable. INTERPRETATION: These analyses suggest that the service need only achieve a modest increase in average quality of life of people with dementia, plus a 10% diversion of people with dementia from residential care, to be cost-effective. The net increase in public expenditure would then, on the assumptions discussed and from a societal perspective, be justified by the expected benefits.

6256,Economic Evaluation of Add-on Levetiracetam for the Treatment of Refractory Partial Epilepsy in Korea,"OBJECTIVE: This study estimated the expected cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as the incremental cost per seizure-free day (SFD) gained and the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained when using levetiracetam (LEV) as add-on therapy from a third-party payer perspective. METHODS: A 1-year dose-escalation decision-tree model comparing LEV plus standard therapy (ST) with ST alone was designed to combine transition probabilities, costs and outcomes. The short-term outcomes and probabilities were derived from a prospective, open-label clinical trial with 100 Korean adults with refractory partial epilepsy. All data for the direct medical costs were derived from Korean cost data extracted from reports published by the National Health Insurance Corporation. RESULTS: The average gain in SFDs attributed to LEV add-on was 18.3 days per patient per year and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for LEV add-on were US$ 44 per SFD per patient and US$ 11,084 per QALY gained. All sensitivity analyses showed that the model was robust to the assumptions made. CONCLUSION: The economic evaluation indicates that, given a wide range of assumptions, the increased cost of treating patients having refractory partial epilepsy with LEV may be partially offset by a reduction in other direct medical costs.

6265,Cost-effectiveness of adjuvant docetaxel for node-positive breast cancer patients: results of the PACS 01 economic study,"BACKGROUND: Using data from the PACS 01 randomized trial, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of anthracyclines plus docetaxel (Taxotere; FEC-D) versus anthracyclines alone (FEC100) in patients with node-positive breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Costs and outcomes were assessed in 1996 patients and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated, using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as outcome. To deal with uncertainty due to sampling fluctuations, confidence regions around the ICERs were calculated and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were drawn up. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out to assess the robustness of conclusions. RESULTS: The mean cost of treatment was 33% higher with strategy FEC-D, but this difference decreased to 18% at a 5-year horizon. The ICER of FEC-D versus FEC100 was estimated to be 9665euro per QALY gained (95% confidence interval euro2372-euro55 515). The estimated probability that FEC-D was cost-effective reached >96% for a threshold of euro50 000 per QALY gained. If the price of taxane decreased slightly, the ICER would reach some very reasonable levels and this strategy would therefore be much more cost-effective. CONCLUSION: The sequential use of FEC100 followed by docetaxel appears to be a cost-effective alternative, even when uncertainty is taken into account.",2009-01-05658,20038515,Ann Oncol,P Marino,2009,/,,No,20038515,"P Marino; C Siani; H Roché; C Protière; P Fumoleau; M Spielmann; A-L Martin; P Viens; A-G Le Corroller Soriano; Cost-effectiveness of adjuvant docetaxel for node-positive breast cancer patients: results of the PACS 01 economic study, Ann Oncol, 2009-Dec-27; ():0923-7534",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Anthracycline plus docetaxel (Taxotere; FEC-D) vs. Anthracyclines alone (FEC-100),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,9665,United States,2006,12407.78
6266,Cost-utility and value-of-information analysis of early versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis,"BACKGROUND:: A recent systematic review found early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (ELC) to be safe and to shorten total hospital stay compared with delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy (DLC) for acute cholecystitis. The cost-effectiveness of ELC versus DLC for acute cholecystitis is unknown. METHODS:: A decision tree model estimating and comparing costs to the UK National Health Service (NHS) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained following a policy of either ELC or DLC was developed with a time horizon of 1 year. Uncertainty was investigated with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and value-of-information analysis estimated the likely return from further investment in research in this area. RESULTS:: ELC is less costly (approximately - pound820 per patient) and results in better quality of life (+0.05 QALYs per patient) than DLC. Given a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20 000 per QALY gained, there is a 70.9 per cent probability that ELC is cost effective compared with DLC. Full implementation of ELC could save the NHS pound8.5 million per annum. CONCLUSION:: The results of this decision analytic modelling study suggest that on average ELC is less expensive and results in better quality of life than DLC. Future research should focus on quality-of-life measures alone. Copyright (c) 2009 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

6267,Cost-effectiveness of genotype-guided warfarin dosing for patients with atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotyping has been advocated as a means of improving the accuracy of warfarin dosing. However, the effectiveness of genotyping in improving anticoagulation control and reducing major bleeding has not yet been compellingly demonstrated. Genotyping currently costs $400 to $550. METHODS AND RESULTS: We constructed a Markov model to evaluate whether and under what circumstances genetically-guided warfarin dosing could be cost-effective for newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation patients. Estimates of clinical event rates, treatment and adverse event costs, and utilities for health states were derived from the published literature. The cost-effectiveness of genetically-guided dosing was highly dependent on the assumed effectiveness of genotyping in increasing the amount of time patients spend appropriately anticoagulated. If genotyping increases the time spent in the target international normalized ratio range by <5 percentage points, its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio would be greater than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio falls below $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year if genotyping increases the time spent in range by 9 percentage points. The results were also sensitive to assumptions about the rate of major bleeding events during treatment initiation and the cost of the test. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that genotyping before warfarin initiation will be cost-effective for patients with atrial fibrillation only if it reduces out-of-range international normalized ratio values by more than 5 to 9 percentage points compared with usual care. Given the current uncertainty surrounding genotyping efficacy, caution should be taken in advocating the widespread adoption of this strategy.",2009-01-05664,20031873,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,Amanda R Patrick,2009,2 / 5,429-36,No,20031873,"Amanda R Patrick; Jerry Avorn; Niteesh K Choudhry; Cost-effectiveness of genotype-guided warfarin dosing for patients with atrial fibrillation, Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, 2009-Sep; 2(5):1941-7705; 429-36",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Warfarin therapy; targeted by positive genotyping for CYP2C9 or VKORC1 vs. Usual Care; no genotyping,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,120000,United States,2007,149787.89
6268,Cost-effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest,"BACKGROUND: Therapeutic hypothermia can improve survival and neurological outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors, but its cost-effectiveness is uncertain. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating comatose cardiac arrest survivors with therapeutic hypothermia. METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision model was developed to capture costs and outcomes for patients with witnessed out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation arrest who received conventional care or therapeutic hypothermia. The Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest (HACA) trial inclusion criteria were assumed. Model inputs were determined from published data, cooling device companies, and consultation with resuscitation experts. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to identify influential variables and uncertainty in cost-effectiveness estimates. The main outcome measures were quality-adjusted survival after cardiac arrest, cost of hypothermia implementation, cost of posthospital discharge care, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. In our model, postarrest patients receiving therapeutic hypothermia gained an average of 0.66 quality-adjusted life years compared with conventional care, at an incremental cost of $31,254. This yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $47,168 per quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that poor neurological outcome postcooling and costs associated with posthypothermia care (in-hospital and long term) were the most influential variables in the model. Even at extreme estimates for costs, the cost-effectiveness of hypothermia remained less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year. In 91% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSIONS: In cardiac arrest survivors who meet HACA criteria, therapeutic hypothermia with a cooling blanket improves clinical outcomes with cost-effectiveness that is comparable to many economically acceptable health care interventions in the United States.",2009-01-05665,20031872,Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes,Raina M Merchant,2009,2 / 5,421-8,No,20031872,"Raina M Merchant; Lance B Becker; Benjamin S Abella; David A Asch; Peter W Groeneveld; Cost-effectiveness of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest, Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes, 2009-Sep; 2(5):1941-7705; 421-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Therapeutic hypothermia; cooling blanket vs. Conventional care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,47168,United States,2008,56699.62
6269,Screening for postnatal depression in primary care: cost effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of routine screening for postnatal depression in primary care. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis with a decision model of alternative methods of screening for depression, including standardised postnatal depression and generic depression instruments. The performance of screening instruments was derived from a systematic review and bivariate meta-analysis at a range of instrument cut points; estimates of other relevant parameters were derived from literature sources and relevant databases. A decision tree considered the full treatment pathway from the possible onset of postnatal depression through identification, treatment, and possible relapse. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical population of women assessed for postnatal depression either via routine care only or supplemented by use of formal identification methods six weeks postnatally, as recommended in recent guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs expressed in 2006-7 prices and impact on health outcomes expressed in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs). The time horizon of the analysis was one year. RESULTS: The routine application of either postnatal or general depression questionnaires did not seem to be cost effective compared with routine care only. The Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (at a cut point of 16) had an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound 41,103 (euro 45,398, $67,130) per QALY compared with routine care only. The ICER for all other strategies ranged from pound 49,928 to pound 272,463 per QALY versus routine care only, while the probability that no formal identification strategy was cost effective was 88% (59%) at a cost effectiveness threshold of pound 20,000 ( pound 30,000) per QALY. While sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost of managing incorrectly identified depression (false positive result) was an important driver of the model, formal identification approaches did not seem to be cost effective at any feasible estimate of this cost. CONCLUSIONS: Formal identification methods for postnatal depression do not seem to represent value for money for the NHS. The major determinant of cost effectiveness seems to be the potential additional costs of managing women incorrectly diagnosed as depressed. Formal identification methods for postnatal depression do not currently satisfy the National Screening Committee's criteria for the adoption of a screening strategy as part of national health policy.",2009-01-05668,20028779,BMJ,Mike Paulden,2009,339 /,b5203,No,20028779,"Mike Paulden; Stephen Palmer; Catherine Hewitt; Simon Gilbody; Screening for postnatal depression in primary care: cost effectiveness analysis, BMJ, 2009; 339():0959-8138; b5203",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine screening for postnatal depression in primary care vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,41103,United Kingdom,2007,102714.74
6270,Cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus managed without insulin,"BACKGROUND: The benefits of self-monitoring blood glucose levels are unclear in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who do not use insulin, but there are considerable costs. We sought to determine the cost effectiveness of self-monitoring for patients with type 2 diabetes not using insulin. METHODS: We performed an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of the self-monitoring of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes not taking insulin. We used the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) model to forecast diabetes-related complications, corresponding quality-adjusted life years and costs. Clinical data were obtained from a systematic review comparing self-monitoring with no self-monitoring. Costs and utility decrements were derived from published sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Based on a clinically modest reduction in hemoglobin A1C of 0.25% (95% confidence interval 0.15-0.36) estimated from the systematic review, the UKPDS model predicted that self-monitoring performed 7 or more times per week reduced the lifetime incidence of diabetes-related complications compared with no self-monitoring, albeit at a higher cost (incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year $113 643). The results were largely unchanged in the sensitivity analysis, although the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year fell within widely cited cost-effectiveness thresholds when testing frequency or the price per test strip was substantially reduced from the current levels. INTERPRETATION: For most patients with type 2 diabetes not using insulin, use of blood glucose test strips for frequent self-monitoring (>/= 7 times per week) is unlikely to represent efficient use of finite health care resources, although periodic testing (e.g., 1 or 2 times per week) may be costeffective.

6271,Five years treatment with strontium ranelate reduces vertebral and nonvertebral fractures and increases the number and quality of remaining life-years in women over 80 years of age,"INTRODUCTION: Longevity has resulted in a greater proportion of the population entering a time of life when increasing bone fragility and falls predispose to fractures, particularly nonvertebral fractures. Women over 80 years of age constitute 10% of the population but contribute 30% of all fractures and 60% of all nonvertebral fractures. Despite this, few studies have examined antifracture efficacy of treatments in this high-risk group and none has provided evidence for benefits beyond 3 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine whether strontium ranelate reduces the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures during 5 years, we analyzed a subgroup of 1489 female patients over 80 years of age (mean 83.5+/-3.0 years) with osteoporosis from the SOTI (spinal osteoporosis therapeutic intervention) and TROPOS (treatment of peripheral osteoporosis) studies randomized to strontium ranelate 2 g/d or placebo. All received a supplement of calcium plus vitamin D. RESULTS: By intention to treat, vertebral fracture risk was reduced by 31% (relative risk, RR=0.69; 95% confidence interval, CI 0.52-0.92), nonvertebral fracture risk by 27% (RR=0.73; 95% CI 0.57-0.95), major nonvertebral fracture risk by 33% (RR=0.67; 95% CI 0.50-0.89) and hip fracture risk by 24% (RR=0.76; 95% CI 0.50-1.15, not significant). Treatment was cost-saving as it decreased cost and increased QALYs and life-years. DISCUSSION: Strontium ranelate safely produced a significant reduction in vertebral and nonvertebral fracture risk during 5 years in postmenopausal women over 80 years of age and was cost saving.",2009-01-05672,20026265,Bone,Ego Seeman,2009,/,,No,20026265,"Ego Seeman; Steven Boonen; Frederik Borgström; Bruno Vellas; Jean-Pierre Aquino; Jutta Semler; Claude-Laurent Benhamou; Jean-Marc Kaufman; Jean-Yves Reginster; Five years treatment with strontium ranelate reduces vertebral and nonvertebral fractures and increases the number and quality of remaining life-years in women over 80 years of age, Bone, 2009-Dec-21; ():8756-3282",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Strontium ranelate vs. No intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,81 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-345862.75,Sweden,2008,-63876.36

6275,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of a high-intensity statin compared to a low-intensity statin in the management of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia,"Abstract Objectives: To estimate, using probabilistic decision-analytic modelling techniques, the cost effectiveness of treating familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) patients with high-intensity statins compared to treatment with low-intensity statins. For the purpose of this economic analysis, and based on their known differences, statins were categorised as high intensity if they produce greater LDL-cholesterol reductions than simvastatin 40 mg (e.g., simvastatin 80 mg and appropriate doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin or combination of statins + ezetimibe). Methods: A lifetime Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of treating a hypothetical cohort of 1000 FH patients aged between 20 and 70 years. Baseline coronary heart disease risks reported in the NICE TA 94 on statins, and age-adjusted risk of cardiovascular disease reported in the FH population, were used to populate the model. A meta-analysis estimate of the reduction in cardiovascular events from using high-intensity compared with low-intensity statins was obtained from published trials. Results were interpreted using a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20 000/QALY. Results: Fewer cardiovascular events and deaths were predicted to occur in the group treated with higher-intensity statins, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated at pound11 103/QALY. The ICER remained below the pound20 000 threshold for 20-39-year-olds and 40-59-year-olds, but rose above this threshold in individuals aged over 60 years. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to variation in treatment effect on mortality and the cost of high-intensity statins. Conclusions: Modelling demonstrates that high-intensity statins are cost-effective for the treatment of younger FH patients. If, as is likely, the relative price of high-intensity statins fall in the future as they come off patent, then their cost effectiveness will improve further.",2009-01-05684,20014994,Curr Med Res Opin,L Nherera,2009,/,,No,20014994,"L Nherera; N W Calvert; K Demott; S E Humphries; H A W Neil; R Minhas; M Thorogood; Cost-effectiveness analysis of the use of a high-intensity statin compared to a low-intensity statin in the management of patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia, Curr Med Res Opin, 2009-Dec-17; ():0300-7995",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,High-intensity statins vs. Low-intensity statins,Not Stated,70 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,11103,United Kingdom,2008,24751.14
6276,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of expanded antiviral prophylaxis and adjuvanted vaccination strategies for an influenza A (H5N1) pandemic,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic potential of influenza A (H5N1) virus is a prominent public health concern of the 21st century. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative pandemic (H5N1) mitigation and response strategies. DESIGN: Compartmental epidemic model in conjunction with a Markov model of disease progression. DATA SOURCES: Literature and expert opinion. TARGET POPULATION: Residents of a U.S. metropolitan city with a population of 8.3 million. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: 3 scenarios: 1) vaccination and antiviral pharmacotherapy in quantities similar to those currently available in the U.S. stockpile (stockpiled strategy), 2) stockpiled strategy but with expanded distribution of antiviral agents (expanded prophylaxis strategy), and 3) stockpiled strategy but with adjuvanted vaccine (expanded vaccination strategy). All scenarios assumed standard nonpharmaceutical interventions. OUTCOME MEASURES: Infections and deaths averted, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Expanded vaccination was the most effective and cost-effective of the 3 strategies, averting 68% of infections and deaths and gaining 404 030 QALYs at $10 844 per QALY gained relative to the stockpiled strategy. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Expanded vaccination remained incrementally cost-effective over a wide range of assumptions. LIMITATIONS: The model assumed homogenous mixing of cases and contacts; heterogeneous mixing would result in faster initial spread, followed by slower spread. We did not model interventions for children or older adults; the model is not designed to target interventions to specific groups.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pandemic influenza (H1N1) vaccination under different scenarios in October or November 2009. DESIGN: Compartmental epidemic model in conjunction with a Markov model of disease progression. DATA SOURCES: Literature and expert opinion. TARGET POPULATION: Residents of a major U.S. metropolitan city with a population of 8.3 million. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Vaccination in mid-October or mid-November 2009. OUTCOME MEASURES: Infections and deaths averted, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Assuming each primary infection causes 1.5 secondary infections, vaccinating 40% of the population in October or November would be cost-saving. Vaccination in October would avert 2051 deaths, gain 69 679 QALYs, and save $469 million compared with no vaccination; vaccination in November would avert 1468 deaths, gain 49 422 QALYs, and save $302 million. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Vaccination is even more cost-saving if longer incubation periods, lower rates of infectiousness, or increased implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions delay time to the peak of the pandemic. Vaccination saves fewer lives and is less cost-effective if the epidemic peaks earlier than mid-October. LIMITATIONS: The model assumed homogenous mixing of case-patients and contacts; heterogeneous mixing would result in faster initial spread, followed by slower spread. Additional costs and savings not included in the model would make vaccination more cost-saving. CONCLUSION: Earlier vaccination against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 prevents more deaths and is more cost-saving.

6280,Cost-utility analysis of infliximab and adalimumab for refractory ulcerative colitis,"ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cost-utility of infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) refractory to conventional therapies in Canada. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg infliximab and adalimumab therapies compared to 'usual care' in treating a hypothetical cohort of patients (aged 40 years and weighing 80 kg) over a five-year time horizon from the perspective of a publicly-funded health care system. Clinical parameters were derived from the Active Ulcerative Colitis Trials 1 and 2. Costs were obtained through provincial drug benefit plans. ICUR was the main outcome measure and both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Compared to the strategy A ('usual care') in the base case analysis, the ICURs were CA$358,088/QALY for the strategy B ('5 mg/kg infliximab + adalimumab') and CA$575,540/QALY for the strategy C ('5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg infliximab + adalimumab'). The results were sensitive to: the remission rates maintained in responders to 'usual care' and to 5 mg/kg infliximab, the rate of remission induced by adalimumab in non-responders to 5 mg/kg infliximab, early surgery rate, and utility values. When the willingness to pay (WTP) was less than CA$150,000/QALY, the probability of 'usual care' being the optimal strategy was 1.0. The probability of strategy B being optimal was 0.5 when the WTP approximated CA$400,000/QALY.

6282,Indirect cost-effectiveness analyses of abatacept and rituximab in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in the United States,"Abstract Objective: To estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for abatacept and rituximab, in combination with methotrexate, relative to methotrexate alone in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: A patient-level simulation model was used to depict the progression of functional disability over the lifetimes of women aged 55-64 years with active RA and inadequate response to a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha antagonist therapy. Future health-state utilities and medical care costs were based on projected values of the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Patients were assumed to receive abatacept or rituximab in combination with methotrexate until death or therapy discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or adverse events. HAQ-DI improvement at month 6, after adjustments for control drug (methotrexate) response, was derived from two clinical trials. Costs of medical care and biologic drugs, discounted at 3% annually, were from the perspective of a US third-party payer and expressed in 2007 US dollars. Results: Relative to methotrexate alone, abatacept/methotrexate and rituximab/methotrexate therapies were estimated to yield an average of 1.25 and 1.10 additional QALYs per patient, at mean incremental costs of $58,989 and $60,380, respectively. The incremental cost-utility ratio relative to methotrexate was $47,191 (95% CI $44,810-49,920) per QALY gained for abatacept/methotrexate and $54,891 (95% CI $52,274-58,073) per QALY gained for rituximab/methotrexate. At an acceptability threshold of $50,000 per QALY, the probability of cost effectiveness was 90% for abatacept and 0.0% for rituximab.

6284,Cost-effectiveness analysis of rituximab treatment in patients in Germany with rheumatoid arthritis after etanercept-failure,"OBJECTIVE: The present health economic analysis investigated the cost-effectiveness-ratios of either (1) rituximab or (2) an alternative TNF-alpha-inhibiting agent as second line biological treatment in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response to etanercept therapy. METHODS: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by rituximab treatment of RA is compared to TNF-inhibitor change (standard sequence) in a Markov-model (perspective: health care payer, full life-time approach). Direct cost components taken into account were treatment costs (medication-, administration- and monitoring costs) and resource utilisation (outpatient costs, inpatient costs). Indirect costs were estimated separately by the assessment of impaired work capacity due to RA (2008 Euro currency, discount rate 3.5%). Utility measures for the different treatment options were obtained from the ACR-response rates of published pivotal clinical trials. RESULTS: Direct costs amount to <euro> 178,373 (standard sequence) and <euro> 192,295 (rituximab sequence), respectively, rendering incremental direct costs of <euro> 13,922. Incremental utilities yield 0.57 QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness-ratio (ICER) of rituximab compared to the standard sequence amounts to <euro> 24,517. Inclusion of indirect costs leads to less incremental costs and a lower ICER of <euro> 15,565/QALY. Thus, ICERs stay beneath the accepted threshold of <euro> 50,000/QALY.

6285,Cost effectiveness of palivizumab in Spain: an analysis using observational data,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness of palivizumab for prevention of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease in high-risk infants in Spain, incorporating country-specific observational hospitalisation data. METHODS: An existing decision tree model, designed using data from a large international clinical trial of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis, was updated to include Spanish observational hospitalisation data. The analysis was performed for preterm children born at or before 32 weeks gestational age, who are at high risk of developing severe RSV disease requiring hospitalisation. Data sources included published literature, official price/tariff lists and national population statistics. The primary perspective of the study was that of the Spanish National Health Service in 2006. RESULTS: The base-case analysis included the direct medical costs associated with palivizumab prophylaxis and hospital care for RSV infections. Use of palivizumab produces an undiscounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of <euro>6,142 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and a discounted ICER of <euro>12,814/QALY.

6286,Aneurysm Occlusion in Elderly Patients with Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Aneurysm occlusion after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) aims to improve outcome by reducing the rebleeding risk. With increasing age overall prognosis decreases and the complications of aneurysm occlusion increase. The balance of risks for aneurysm occlusion in elderly SAH patients in different age categories and clinical conditions is unknown. METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate quality-adjusted life years (QALY), additional costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of aneurysm occlusion in 192 patient subgroups, based on age, gender, neurological condition at admission, time since SAH, and aneurysm size and location. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For patients admitted in poor condition >/=10 days after SAH, and patients older than 80 year, admitted in poor condition admitted >/=4 days after SAH, occlusion implied QALY loss and increased costs. Only for women younger than 79 and men younger than 74 years admitted in good condition within 4 days the ICER of occlusion fell below euro 50,000 per QALY. Occlusion was beneficial and cost-saving in women aged 74 years or younger admitted in good condition within 4 days and a small posterior circulation aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS: Aneurysm occlusion is harmful in some subgroups of elderly patients and beneficial in others. It is cost-effective only in specific subgroups that comprise a large part of the patients encountered in clinical practice. Beyond the age of 80 years the balance between risks and benefits is often no longer positive for occlusion, and it should only be considered if the predicted life expectancy leaves margin for benefit.",2009-01-05710,19965848,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,Hendrik Koffijberg,2009,/,,No,19965848,"Hendrik Koffijberg; Gabriel J E Rinkel; Erik Buskens; Aneurysm Occlusion in Elderly Patients with Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Cost-Utility Analysis, J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry, 2009-Dec-03; ():0022-3050",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Aneurysm occlusion vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,247,Euro,2007,422.72
6287,Costs and consequences of automated algorithms versus manual grading for the detection of referable diabetic retinopathy,"AIMS: to assess the cost-effectiveness of an improved automated grading algorithm for diabetic retinopathy against a previously described algorithm, and in comparison with manual grading. METHODS: Efficacy of the alternative algorithms was assessed using a reference graded set of images from three screening centres in Scotland (1253 cases with observable / referable retinopathy and 6,333 individuals with mild or no retinopathy). Screening outcomes and grading and diagnosis costs were modelled for a cohort of 180,000 people, with prevalence of referable retinopathy at 4%. Algorithm (b), which combines image quality assessment with detection algorithms for microaneurysms (MA), blot haemorrhages and exudates, was compared with a simpler algorithm (a) (utilising image quality assessment and MA/dot haemorrhage (DH) detection), and the current practice of manual grading. RESULTS: Compared with algorithm (a), algorithm (b) would identify an additional 113 cases of referable retinopathy for an incremental cost of pound68 per additional case. Compared with manual grading, automated grading would be expected to identify between 54 and 123 fewer referable cases, for a grading cost saving between pound3,834 and pound1,727 per case missed. Extrapolation modelling over a 20 year time horizon suggests manual grading would cost between pound29,111 and pound289,917 per additional quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained CONCLUSIONS: Algorithm (b) is more cost-effective than the algorithm based on quality assessment and MA/DH detection.

6288,Economic evaluation of zoledronic acid for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are used as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (BC) and are associated with accelerated bone loss. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) prevents aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss (AIBL) in postmenopausal women with BC. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of ZOL for prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women with BC. Materials and methods: A Markov model was developed to project lifetime incidence of fractures, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and costs as a function of bone mineral density (BMD) for women with early-stage BC receiving letrozole alone or with ZOL. Two strategies of ZOL therapy were compared with no treatment: starting ZOL treatment only when BMD levels decreased ('delayed ZOL') and starting ZOL simultaneously with letrozole therapy ('upfront ZOL'). RESULTS: Delayed ZOL therapy was estimated to cost pound16 069 per QALY, when compared with not administering bisphosphonates for AIBL prevention. The corresponding cost per QALY gained for upfront ZOL versus no treatment was estimated at pound21 973.

6290,Economic evaluation of zoledronic acid for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer receiving aromatase inhibitors in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Aromatase inhibitors are used as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (BC) and are associated with accelerated bone loss. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) prevents aromatase inhibitor-associated bone loss (AIBL) in postmenopausal women with BC. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of ZOL for prevention of fractures in postmenopausal women with BC. Materials and methods: A Markov model was developed to project lifetime incidence of fractures, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and costs as a function of bone mineral density (BMD) for women with early-stage BC receiving letrozole alone or with ZOL. Two strategies of ZOL therapy were compared with no treatment: starting ZOL treatment only when BMD levels decreased ('delayed ZOL') and starting ZOL simultaneously with letrozole therapy ('upfront ZOL'). RESULTS: Delayed ZOL therapy was estimated to cost pound16 069 per QALY, when compared with not administering bisphosphonates for AIBL prevention. The corresponding cost per QALY gained for upfront ZOL versus no treatment was estimated at pound21 973. The cost-effectiveness ratio for upfront versus delayed therapy was estimated at pound24 868 per QALY gained.

6291,A cost-utility analysis of amputation versus salvage for Gustilo type IIIB and IIIC open tibial fractures,"BACKGROUND: Lower extremity trauma is common. Despite an abundance of literature on severe injuries that can be treated with salvage or amputation, the appropriate management of these injuries remains uncertain. In this situation, a cost-utility analysis is an important tool in providing an evidence-based practice approach to guide treatment decisions. METHODS: Costs following amputation and salvage were derived from data presented in a study that emerged from the Lower Extremity Assessment Project. The authors extracted relevant data on projected lifetime costs and analyzed them to include discounting and sensitivity analysis by considering patient age. The utilities for the various health states (amputation or salvage, including possible complications) were measured previously using the standard gamble method and a decision tree simulation to determine quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS: Amputation is more expensive than salvage, independently of varied ongoing prosthesis needs, discount rate, and patient age at presentation. Moreover, amputation yields fewer quality-adjusted life-years than salvage. Salvage is deemed the dominant, cost-saving strategy. CONCLUSION: Unless the injury is so severe that salvage is not a possibility, based on this economic model, surgeons should consider limb salvage, which will yield lower costs and higher utility when compared with amputation.",2009-01-05720,19952652,Plast Reconstr Surg,Kevin C Chung,2009,124 / 6,1965-73,No,19952652,"Kevin C Chung; Daniel Saddawi-Konefka; Steven C Haase; Gautam Kaul; A cost-utility analysis of amputation versus salvage for Gustilo type IIIB and IIIC open tibial fractures, Plast Reconstr Surg, 2009-Dec; 124(6):0032-1052; 1965-73",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Salvage of lower leg vs. Amputation of lower leg,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,285278.13,United States,2002,410411.99
6292,Verteporfin photodynamic therapy cohort study: report 3: cost effectiveness and lessons for future evaluations,"PURPOSE: To report (1) the costs of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (VPDT) in routine treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), (2) the relationship between health and social service costs and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), (3) the cost-effectiveness of VPDT versus a best supportive care (BSC) group who were assumed to have no active treatment, and (4) lessons for future cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). DESIGN: The CEA of VPDT versus BSC that uses health-related quality of life (HrQoL), resource use, and visual acuity data from the United Kingdom (UK) VPDT Cohort Study. PARTICIPANTS: Data on VPDT use were collected from patients attending 45 ophthalmology provider units in the UK National Health Service, 15 units collected data on self-reported use of services. METHODS: Incremental costs of VPDT versus BSC were calculated from treatment costs, change in cost associated with declining BCVA, and difference in BCVA previously attributed to VPDT. Similarly, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from change in HRQoL associated with declining BCVA, giving an incremental cost per QALY of VPDT versus BSC over 2 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs (UK pounds [ pound]; United States dollars [$]); incremental QALYs; costs per QALY. RESULTS: The treatment costs of VDPT were pound 3026 ($4544) in year 1 and pound 845 ($1269) in year 2. For patients who used services, a 5-letter decrease in BCVA was associated with an increase in annual costs of approximately pound 110 ($165; 95% confidence intervals, approximately pound 48 [$72] to pound 174 [$261]). The incremental costs and QALYs for VPDT were pound 3514 ($5276) and 0.021, respectively, giving incremental costs per QALY gained of pound 170000 ($255000). CONCLUSIONS: Verteporfin photodynamic therapy is unlikely to be cost effective for patients with nAMD. This article provides realistic estimates of VPDT costs and the costs associated with declining vision.

DESIGN: This study is a randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: This study included 50 patients aged 60 or older admitted to hospital with a severely displaced three- or four-part fracture. INTERVENTIONS: The patients were treated surgically with an angular stable interlocking implant (25 patients) or conservative treatment (25 patients). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The outcomes measured included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and societal costs. RESULTS: At 12 months' follow-up, the mean difference in the number of QALYs was 0.027 (95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.025, 0.078) while the mean difference in total health-care costs was euro597 in favour of surgery (95% CI=-5291, 3777).

6294,Cost-utility analysis of rufinamide versus topiramate and lamotrigine for the treatment of children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in the United Kingdom,"PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of rufinamide relative to topiramate and lamotrigine as adjunctive treatment for children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS). METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over a three-year time horizon in patients with LGS uncontrolled by up to three antiepileptic drugs. Utilities were assigned to health states, defined according to a patient's response to treatment (>/=75%, >/=50% and <75%, and <50% reduction in tonic-atonic [drop attack] seizure frequency and death). Efficacy and safety estimates were made using indirect/mixed-treatment comparisons of data obtained from published literature. Outcomes included costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), allowing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to be estimated as cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Over three years, the total cumulative costs for rufinamide, topiramate, and lamotrigine were pound24,992, pound23,360, and pound21,783, respectively. Rufinamide resulted in an incremental QALY gain of 0.079 relative to topiramate and 0.021 relative to lamotrigine. The incremental costs of rufinamide were pound1632 and pound3209, relative to topiramate and lamotrigine, resulting in an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound20,538 and pound154,831, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the underlying assumptions, this current economic evaluation demonstrates that rufinamide is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to topiramate as adjunctive treatment for children with LGS in the UK. In addition, when compared to lamotrigine, which is an inexpensive treatment, rufinamide should be considered as a cost-effective alternative due to the importance of patient choice and equity of access in such a rare and devastating condition.",2009-01-05731,19942457,Seizure,Lara Verdian,2009,/,,No,19942457,"Lara Verdian; Yunni Yi; Cost-utility analysis of rufinamide versus topiramate and lamotrigine for the treatment of children with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in the United Kingdom, Seizure, 2009-Nov-24; ():1059-1311",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Patients receiving rufinamide vs. Patients receiving topiramate,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.50,3.50,20538,United Kingdom,2007,51323.64

6296,A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS OF THREE TREATMENTS FOR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION,"PURPOSE:: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pegaptanib sodium and ranibizumab injections compared with photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration. METHODS:: The analyses were performed using outcomes data from the pivotal trials for each treatment and the medicare reimbursable costs for each treatment and associated medical procedures. A multistate transition model with 3-month cycles was created to compare incremental medical costs associated with pegaptanib or ranibizumab versus PDT for patients with starting vision of 20/40, 20/80, and 20/200 Snellen equivalent. RESULTS:: Two-year medical treatment costs ranged from $3,100 to $54,100 depending on treatment and lesion type. Photodynamic therapy was less costly and more effective than pegaptanib for predominantly classic and minimally classic lesions. Ranibizumab was not only more effective but also more costly than PDT for all lesion types. CONCLUSION:: Compared with PDT, pegaptanib is inferior in both cost and effectiveness, whereas ranibizumab has a greater effectiveness.
