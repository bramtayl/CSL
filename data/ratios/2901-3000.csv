2905,Development of an economic model to assess the cost effectiveness of treatment interventions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a Markov model that allows the cost effectiveness of interventions in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) to be estimated, and to apply the model to investigate the cost effectiveness of an inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist (beta(2)-agonist) combination (salmeterol/fluticasone propionate) versus usual care. METHODS: A Markov model consisting of four mutually exclusive disease states was constructed (mild, moderate and severe disease, and death). The transition probabilities of disease progression (for smokers and ex-smokers) and death were derived from the published medical literature. The model outputs were costs, exacerbations, survival, QALYs and cost effectiveness. The model was made fully probabilistic to reflect the joint uncertainty in the model parameters. Efficacy data for the combination of inhaled salmeterol/fluticasone propionate 50/500microg twice daily in poorly reversible COPD patients with a history of exacerbations were obtained from the 1-year TRISTAN (TRial of Inhaled STeroids ANd long-acting beta-agonists) study and applied to the model, based on patient profiles representative of COPD clinical trials. RESULTS: According to the model, the mean life expectancy with usual care alone (placebo group) was 8.95 years, which decreased to 4.08 QALYs once adjusted for quality and discounted, at a lifetime discounted cost of Can 16,415 dollars per patient (year 2002 values). Assuming that salmeterol/fluticasone propionate reduced exacerbation frequency only (base case analysis), the estimated mean survival time remained unchanged but there was an increase in the number of QALYs (4.21) for an estimated lifetime cost of Can 25,780 dollars, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of Can 74,887 dollars per QALY (95% CI 21,985, 128,671) versus usual care. If a survival benefit was assumed for salmeterol/fluticasone propionate, the incremental cost per QALY was Can11,125 dollars (95% CI 8710, dominated) versus usual care. If the combination achieved around a 10% improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, leading to delayed progression to more severe disease states, the benefits translated into an incremental cost per QALY of Can 49,928 dollars (95% CI 37 269, 66,006) versus usual care. CONCLUSIONS: This Markov model allows, for the first time, a means of estimating the long-term cost effectiveness and cost utility of interventions for COPD. Initial evidence suggests that for patients with poorly reversible COPD and a documented history of frequent COPD exacerbations, the addition of salmeterol (a long-acting beta(2)-agonist) to fluticasone propionate (an inhaled corticosteroid) is potentially cost effective from the Canadian healthcare payer's perspective. However, the precision of this estimate will be improved when additional data are available from clinical trials such as the ongoing TORCH (TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health) study.",2005-01-01333,15960557,Pharmacoeconomics,Michael Spencer,2005,23 / 6,619-37,Yes,15960557,"Michael Spencer; Andrew H Briggs; Ronald F Grossman; Laureen Rance; Development of an economic model to assess the cost effectiveness of treatment interventions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Pharmacoeconomics, 2005; 23(6):1179-2027; 619-37",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Salmeterol/fluticasone propionate and usual care vs. Placebo and usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,5.00,5.00,74887,Canada,2002,68618.69
2906,The cost effectiveness of infliximab for severe treatment-resistant rheumatoid arthritis in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness (from the UK NHS and personal social service perspectives) of infliximab plus methotrexate (MTX) compared with MTX alone, in the treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who were not adequately controlled on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and who were resistant to MTX. METHOD: Clinical data for the first year of therapy were taken from the ATTRACT (Anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis with Concomitant Therapy) and a Markov model developed to assess costs and consequences in the longer term. Transition probabilities and health state valuations for the model were estimated based on the ARAMIS (Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System) cohort, and resource use and costs ( 2,000 pounds values) obtained from various sources in the UK. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The primary analysis suggested that infliximab plus MTX had an ICER of 33,618 pounds per QALY gained. Alternative modelling assumptions and various other sensitivity analyses were applied, but the ICER always remained within the range for interventions typically funded by the NHS. CONCLUSION: This model suggests, with its underlying assumptions and data, that the combination of infliximab and MTX may be a cost-effective treatment (from the UK NHS and personal social service perspectives) for patients experiencing RA that cannot be maintained on MTX alone.",2005-01-01334,15960556,Pharmacoeconomics,Marco Barbieri,2005,23 / 6,607-18,Yes,15960556,"Marco Barbieri; John B Wong; Michael Drummond; The cost effectiveness of infliximab for severe treatment-resistant rheumatoid arthritis in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2005; 23(6):1179-2027; 607-18",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Infliximab and methotrexate (MTX) vs. Placebo and MTX,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,1.50,23926,United Kingdom,2000,54499.91
2907,The cost-effectiveness of raising the legal smoking age in California,"Given evidence that most smokers start smoking before the age of 18 and that smokers who start earlier in life are less likely to quit, policies that reduce or delay initiation could have a large impact on public health. Raising the legal minimum purchase age of cigarettes to 21 may be an effective way for states to reduce youth smoking by making it harder for teens to buy cigarettes from stores and by reducing the number of legal buyers they encounter in their normal social circles. To inform the ongoing debate over this policy option in California, this study provides an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of raising the state's legal smoking age to 21. Costs and benefits were estimated from a societal perspective using a dynamic computer simulation model that simulates changes to the California population in age, composition, and smoking behavior over time. Secondary data for model parameters were obtained from publicly available sources. Population health impacts were estimated in terms of smoking prevalence and the change in cumulative quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to the California population over a 50-year period. Economic impacts were measured in monetary terms for medical cost savings, cost of law enforcement, and cost of checking identification. Compared to a status quo simulation, raising the smoking age to 21 would result in a drop in teen (ages 14-17) smoking prevalence from 13.3% to 2.4% (82% reduction). The policy would generate no net costs, in fact saving the state and its inhabitants a total of $24 billion over the next 50 years with a gain of 1.47 million QALYs compared to status quo. This research should prove useful to California's policy makers as they contemplate legislation to raise the state's legal smoking age.",2005-01-01340,15951460,Med Decis Making,Sajjad Ahmad,2005,25 / 3,330-40,No,15951460,"Sajjad Ahmad; The cost-effectiveness of raising the legal smoking age in California, Med Decis Making, 2005 May-Jun; 25(3):0272-989X; 330-40",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Increasing California legal smoking age from 18 to 21 and random checks of tabaco outlets vs. Status quo,Not Stated,21 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,-16836.25,United States,2003,-23681.56
2908,"Optimal allocation of testing dollars: the example of HIV counseling, testing, and referral","BACKGROUND: Health screening programs can be represented as a pathway of sequential processes: offering a test, obtaining consent, conducting the test, providing results, and linking to appropriate care. Using the example of HIV testing, the authors explore the optimal targeting of funds within this pathway. METHODS: The authors develop a microsimulation of HIV testing services and decompose the likelihood that an unidentified HIV-infected person will receive care into the probability of testing [P(test)] and the probability of follow-up [P(follow)] defined as returning for results and linking to care. The authors examine the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative investments in these component probabilities. RESULTS: At 1% undiagnosed HIV prevalence, cost-effectiveness ratios for HIV testing cluster around $33,000/QALY (quality-adjusted life year) gained. A program with a yield of 0.16 via P(test)=0.20 and P(follow)=0.80 has a cost-effectiveness ratio of $32,900/QALY compared with $36,300/QALY for a program where P(test)=0.80 and P(follow)=0.20. Interventions that improve the probability of success in later stages in the testing pathway [P(follow)] are more cost-effective than investments devoted to earlier stages [P(test)]. CONCLUSIONS: Equivalent pathway outcomes in a screening program do not confer equal value. Limited screening resources are best targeted toward returning for results and linkage among those already identified with disease rather than offering testing to additional people.",2005-01-01341,15951459,Med Decis Making,Rochelle P Walensky,2005,25 / 3,321-9,No,15951459,"Rochelle P Walensky; Milton C Weinstein; Heather E Smith; Kenneth A Freedberg; A David Paltiel; Optimal allocation of testing dollars: the example of HIV counseling, testing, and referral, Med Decis Making, 2005 May-Jun; 25(3):0272-989X; 321-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Test, identify, link to care, and treat vs. No test/treatment",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,34200,United States,2001,49979.31
2909,Cost effectiveness of losartan in patients with hypertension and LVH: an economic evaluation for Sweden of the LIFE trial,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost effectiveness of losartan compared with atenolol from a Swedish national health system perspective. DESIGN: The Losartan Intervention For Endpoint reduction in hypertension study (LIFE) was a double-masked, randomized trial of losartan versus atenolol in 9193 patients with essential hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) ascertained by electrocardiography. Losartan reduced the primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke by 13% (P = 0.021) and reduced the risk of stroke by 25% (P = 0.001), despite a comparable degree of blood pressure control. METHODS: Life years gained was estimated by combining the absolute risk reduction in stroke with the life years gained by preventing stroke. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained was estimated by combining the absolute risk reduction in stroke with the QALYs gained by preventing stroke. QALYs were estimated by weighting life years by health-related quality of life (QoL), as measured with visual analogue scale (VAS) data collected in the trial. Net costs were defined as the total of study medication cost, stroke-related costs, and costs of increased survival. Costs are in 2003 Swedish prices. All costs and effects were discounted at a 3% annual rate. RESULTS: Prevention of a stroke resulted in a gain of 5.7 life years and 4.3 QALYs. As a consequence, losartan treatment resulted in a per patient increase of 0.092 life years [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.038, 0.146] and 0.069 QALYs (95% CI: 0.028, 0.109) as compared with atenolol treatment. Losartan reduced direct stroke-related cost per patient by 1141 euros due to a lower cumulative incidence of stroke for losartan at 5.5 years (4.9%) as compared with atenolol (6.5%) (95% CI of difference: 0.7, 2.5). The reduction in stroke-related cost offset 80% of the added cost of losartan drug therapy. After inclusion of study medication cost, net cost per patient was 289 euros higher for losartan than atenolol. The net cost per QALY gained for losartan was 4188 euros (37,813 SEK), which is well within common Swedish benchmark upper values (200-500,000 SEK) for accepted cost-effective interventions. CONCLUSION: Based on the results from the LIFE trial, treatment with losartan compared with atenolol, in hypertensive patients with LVH, is a cost-effective intervention.",2005-01-01347,15942467,J Hypertens,Bengt Jönsson,2005,23 / 7,1425-31,No,15942467,"Bengt Jönsson; George W Carides; Thomas A Burke; Erik J Dasbach; Lars H Lindholm; Björn Dahlöf; Cost effectiveness of losartan in patients with hypertension and LVH: an economic evaluation for Sweden of the LIFE trial, J Hypertens, 2005-Jul; 23(7):0263-6352; 1425-31",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Losartan vs. Atenolol,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,4188,Euro,2003,6668.68
2910,Cost utility analysis of co-prescribed heroin compared with methadone maintenance treatment in heroin addicts in two randomised trials,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost utility of medical co-prescription of heroin compared with methadone maintenance treatment for chronic, treatment resistant heroin addicts. DESIGN: Cost utility analysis of two pooled open label randomised controlled trials. SETTING: Methadone maintenance programmes in six cities in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 430 heroin addicts. INTERVENTIONS: Inhalable or injectable heroin prescribed over 12 months. Methadone (maximum 150 mg a day) plus heroin (maximum 1000 mg a day) compared with methadone alone (maximum 150 mg a day). Psychosocial treatment was offered throughout. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: One year costs estimated from a societal perspective. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based on responses to the EuroQol EQ-5D at baseline and during the treatment period. RESULTS: Co-prescription of heroin was associated with 0.058 more QALYs per patient per year (95% confidence interval 0.016 to 0.099) and a mean saving of 12,793 euros (8793 pounds sterling, 16,122 dollars) (1083 to 25,229 euros) per patient per year. The higher programme costs (16 222 euros; lower 95% confidence limit 15,084 euros) were compensated for by lower costs of law enforcement (- 4129 euros; upper 95% confidence limit - 486 euros) and damage to victims of crime (- 25,374 euros; upper 95% confidence limit - 16,625 euros). The results were robust for the use of national EQ-5D tariffs and for the exclusion of the initial implementation costs of heroin treatment. Completion of treatment is essential; having participated in any abstinence treatment in the past is not.

2911,Pertussis in adolescents and adults: should we vaccinate?,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of reported pertussis among adolescents, adults, and young infants has increased sharply over the past decade. Combined acellular pertussis vaccines for adolescents and adults are available in Canada, Australia, and Germany and may soon be considered for use in the United States. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential health benefits, risks, and costs of a national pertussis vaccination program for adolescents and/or adults. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: The projected health states and immunity levels associated with pertussis disease and vaccination were simulated with a Markov model. The following strategies were examined from the health care payer and societal perspectives: (1) no vaccination; (2) 1-time adolescent vaccination; (3) 1-time adult vaccination; (4) adult vaccination with boosters; (5) adolescent and adult vaccination with boosters; and (6) postpartum vaccination. Data on disease incidence, costs, outcomes, vaccine efficacy, and adverse events were based on published studies, recent unpublished clinical trials, and expert panel input. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cases prevented, adverse events, costs (in 2004 US dollars), cost per case prevented, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. RESULTS: One-time adolescent vaccination would prevent 30800 cases of pertussis (36% of projected cases) and would result in 91000 vaccine adverse events (67% local reactions). If pertussis vaccination cost $15 and vaccine coverage was 76%, then 1-time adolescent vaccination would cost $1100 per case prevented (or $1200 per case prevented) or $20000 per QALY (or $23000 per QALY) saved, from the societal (or health care payer) perspective. With a threshold of $50000 per QALY saved, the adolescent and adult vaccination with boosters strategy became potentially cost-effective from the societal perspective only if 2 conditions were met simultaneously, ie, (1) the disease incidence for adolescents and adults was > or =6 times higher than base-case assumptions and (2) the cost of vaccination was less than $10. Adult vaccination strategies were more costly and less effective than adolescent vaccination strategies. The results were sensitive to assumptions about disease incidence, vaccine efficacy, frequency of vaccine adverse events, and vaccine costs.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review, prospective observational study, and decision modelling. RESULTS: Introduction of a blood loss chart resulted in a 50% reduction of re-treatments within 1 year (from 25% to 12.5%). The use of the blood loss chart resulted in a slightly higher expected value and lower costs, which is reflected in a more favourable cost/quality adjusted life year (QALY) ratio. CONCLUSION: The use of a blood loss chart as an aid in treatment selection in women with dysfunctional uterine blood loss is feasible. Although its use requires an extra outpatient visit, the associated extra costs are off-set by its impact on initial treatment selection, and, in particular, on the probability of re-treatment within 1 year of follow-up.",2005-01-01357,15925055,Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,Gert Jan van der Wilt,2005,120 / 2,210-6,No,15925055,"Gert Jan van der Wilt; Carina F M Meulendijks; Robbert F A Thijssen; Experience with shared decision making in gynaecological practice: treatment decisions in patients with dysfunctional uterine blood loss, Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol, 2005-Jun-01; 120(2):0301-2115; 210-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with blood loss chart vs. No blood loss chart,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2033.33,Euro,2003,-3237.74

The treatment strategies include a risk-based strategy, a screening-based strategy, a combined screening/risk-based strategy and the current Dutch guideline. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on decision model. SETTING: Obstetric care system in the Netherlands. POPULATION/SAMPLE: Hypothetical cohort of 200,000 neonates. METHODS: A decision analysis model was used to compare the costs and effects of different treatment strategies with no treatment. Baseline estimates were derived from literature and a survey among parents of children affected by GBS disease. The analysis was performed from a societal perspective, and costs and effects were discounted at a percentage of 3%. Main outcome measures Cost per quality adjusted of life-year (QALY). RESULT: The risk-based strategy will prevent 352 cases of early-onset GBS for 5.0 million Euros, indicating a cost-effectiveness ratio of 7600 Euros per QALY gained. The combined screening risk-based strategy has comparable results. The current Dutch guideline resulted in lower effects for higher costs. The screening-based strategy shows the highest reduction in cases of early-onset GBS, however, at a cost-effectiveness ratio of 59,300 Euros per QALY gained. Introducing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test may lead to a more favourable cost-effectiveness ratio.

The analysis was performed from a societal perspective, and costs and effects were discounted at a percentage of 3%. Main outcome measures Cost per quality adjusted of life-year (QALY). RESULT: The risk-based strategy will prevent 352 cases of early-onset GBS for 5.0 million Euros, indicating a cost-effectiveness ratio of 7600 Euros per QALY gained. The combined screening risk-based strategy has comparable results. The current Dutch guideline resulted in lower effects for higher costs. The screening-based strategy shows the highest reduction in cases of early-onset GBS, however, at a cost-effectiveness ratio of 59,300 Euros per QALY gained. Introducing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test may lead to a more favourable cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSION: In the Dutch system, the combined screening/risk-based strategy and the risk-based strategy have reasonable cost-effectiveness ratios. If it becomes feasible to add the PCR test, the cost-effectiveness of the combined screening/risk-based strategy may even be more favourable.",2005-01-01358,15924544,BJOG,M E Akker-van Marle,2005,112 / 6,820-6,No,15924544,"M E Akker-van Marle; M E B Rijnders; P Dommelen; M Fekkes; J P Wouwe; M P Amelink-Verburg; P H Verkerk; Cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies with intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent early-onset group B streptococcal disease, BJOG, 2005-Jun; 112(6):1470-0328; 820-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Risk-based strategy for intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis against group B streptococcal disease vs. No strategy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,7600,Euro,2003,12101.72
2915,Oral anticoagulation strategies after a first idiopathic venous thromboembolic event,"PURPOSE: The optimal duration and intensity of warfarin therapy after a first idiopathic venous thromboembolic event are uncertain. We used decision analysis to evaluate clinical and economic outcomes of different anticoagulation strategies with warfarin. METHODS: We built a Markov model to assess 6 strategies to treat 40- to 80-year-old men and women after their first idiopathic venous thromboembolic event: 3-month, 6-month, 12-month, 24-month, and unlimited-duration conventional-intensity anticoagulation (International Normalized Ratio, 2-3) and unlimited-duration low-intensity anticoagulation (International Normalized Ratio, 1.5-2). The model incorporated age- and sex-specific clinical parameters, utilities, and costs. Using a societal perspective, we compared strategies based on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In our baseline analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were lower in younger patients and in men, reflecting the higher bleeding risk at older ages, and the lower risk of recurrence among women. Based on a willingness-to-pay of <$50000/QALY, the 24-month strategy was most cost-effective in 40-year-old men ($48805/QALY), while the 6-month strategy was preferred in 40-year-old women ($35977/QALY) and 60-year-old men ($29878/QALY). In patients aged >/=80 years, 3-month anticoagulation was less costly and more effective than other strategies. Cost-effectiveness results were influenced by the risks associated with recurrent venous thromboembolism, the major bleeding risk of conventional-intensity anticoagulation and the disutility of taking warfarin.

2918,Cost of lipid lowering in patients with coronary artery disease by case method learning,"OBJECTIVES: This investigation was undertaken to study the costs of a Case Method Learning (CML)-supported lipid-lowering strategy in secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD) in primary care. METHODS: This prospective randomized controlled trial in primary care with an additional external specialist control group in Södertälje, Stockholm County, Sweden, included 255 consecutive patients with CAD. Guidelines were mailed to all general practitioners (GPs; n=54) and presented at a common lecture. GPs who were randomized to the intervention group participated in recurrent CML dialogues at their primary health-care centers during a 2-year period. A locally well-known cardiologist served as a facilitator. Assessment of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was performed at baseline and after 2 years. Analysis according to intention-to-treat-intervention and control groups (n=88)--was based on group affiliation at baseline. The marginal cost of lipid lowering comprised increased cost of lipid-lowering drugs in the intervention group compared with the primary care control group, cost of attendance of the GP's in the intervention group, and cost of time for preparation, travel, and seminars of the facilitator. Costs are as of 2002 with an exchange rate 1 U.S. dollar = 9.5 SEK (Swedish Crowns). RESULTS: Patients in the primary care intervention group had their LDL cholesterol reduced by 0.5 (confidence interval [CI], 0.1-0.9) mmol/L compared with the primary care control group (p < .05). No change occurred in controls. LDL cholesterol in the external specialist control group decreased by 0.6 (CI, 0.4-0.8) mmol/L. The cost of the educational intervention represented only 2 percent of the drug cost. The cost of lipid lowering in the intervention group, including the cost of the educational intervention, was actually lower than that of patients treated at the specialist clinic--106 U.S. dollar per mmol decrease in LDL cholesterol in the intervention group and 153 U.S. dollar per mmol decrease in LDL cholesterol in the specialist group. EuroQol 5D Index, which gives an estimate of global health-related quality of life, was 0.80 (CI, 0.75-0.85) in the present cohort. CONCLUSIONS: The additional cost of CML was only 2 percent of the drug cost. Assuming the same gain in life expectancy per millimole decrease in LDL cholesterol as in the 4S-study gives a cost per gained quality-adjusted life year of U.S. dollar 24,000. This finding indicates that the CML-supported lipid-lowering strategy is cost-effective. The low cost of CML in primary care should probably warrant its use in the improvement of the quality of care in other major chronic diseases.",2005-01-01363,15921057,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Anna Kiessling,2005,21 / 2,180-6,No,15921057,"Anna Kiessling; Niklas Zethraeus; Peter Henriksson; Cost of lipid lowering in patients with coronary artery disease by case method learning, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2005; 21(2):0266-4623; 180-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Case method provider training and new evidence based guidelines for care vs. Local practice guidelines,Not Stated,69 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,5.00,5.00,24300,United States,2002,34958.91

2924,Is a chest pain observation unit likely to be cost effective at my hospital? Extrapolation of data from a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: The ESCAPE trial showed that chest pain observation unit (CPOU) care appeared to be cost effective compared with routine care. This finding may not be generalizable to hospitals that currently admit fewer patients than the trial hospital or that require higher direct costs to provide CPOU care. This study aimed to explore these issues in sensitivity analyses and develop a nomogram to allow prediction of whether a CPOU will be cost effective in a specific hospital. METHODS: Data from the ESCAPE trial was used to populate a decision analysis model comparing CPOU with routine care. Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of varying the admission rate with routine care and the direct running costs of CPOU care following which the nomogram was created. RESULTS: CPOU care provided improved outcome (0.3936 v 0.3799 QALYs) at lower cost (pound sterling 478 v pound sterling 556 per patient), with fewer patients admitted (37% v 54%). Mean cost of CPOU and routine care was pound sterling 116 and pound sterling 73, respectively, and of inpatient hospital stay was pound sterling 312. The mean post-discharge cost for CPOU and routine care was pound sterling 253 and pound sterling 309, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed that CPOU care will not reduce costs at a hospital that currently admits fewer than 35% of patients, or a hospital that expects to incur direct CPOU running costs of pound sterling 60 per patient more than the trial hospital.

2925,Surgical stabilisation of the spine compared with a programme of intensive rehabilitation for the management of patients with chronic low back pain: cost utility analysis based on a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether, from a health provider and patient perspective, surgical stabilisation of the spine is cost effective when compared with an intensive programme of rehabilitation in patients with chronic low back pain. DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: 349 patients randomised to surgery (n = 176) or to an intensive rehabilitation programme (n = 173) from 15 centres across the United Kingdom between June 1996 and February 2002. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs related to back pain and incurred by the NHS and patients up to 24 months after randomisation. Return to paid employment and total hours worked. Patient utility as estimated by using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire at several time points and used to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost effectiveness was expressed as an incremental cost per QALY. RESULTS: At two years, 38 patients randomised to rehabilitation had received rehabilitation and surgery whereas just seven surgery patients had received both treatments. The mean total cost per patient was estimated to be 7830 pounds sterling (SD 5202 pounds sterling) in the surgery group and 4526 pounds sterling (SD 4155 pounds sterling) in the intensive rehabilitation arm, a significant difference of 3304 pounds sterling (95% confidence interval 2317 pounds sterling to 4291 pounds sterling). Mean QALYs over the trial period were 1.004 (SD 0.405) in the surgery group and 0.936 (SD 0.431) in the intensive rehabilitation group, giving a non-significant difference of 0.068 (-0.020 to 0.156).

STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility analyses using a decision analytic model. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we forecast overall survival, costs, and cost effectiveness of using the RS in patients classified as having low or high risk of distant recurrence based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical guidelines. Data from a large multicenter clinical trial (NSABP B-14) were analyzed to derive risk classification based on guideline criteria and RS assignments. Efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) on distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) was based on published meta-analyses of CT trials. The analysis took a societal perspective, considering survival, quality of life, and relevant costs. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients (8%) were classified as having low risk of distant recurrence by NCCN guidelines and the RS reclassified 15 of these patients (28%) to an intermediate/high-risk group. The remaining 615 patients (92%) were classified at high risk of distant recurrence by NCCN guidelines and the RS reclassified 300 of these patients (49%) to a low-risk group. Among a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients, RS is predicted on average to increase quality-adjusted survival by 8.6 years and reduce overall costs by $202 828. RS was cost saving in more than two-thirds of probabilistic simulations, with cost effectiveness most influenced by the propensity to administer CT based on RS results, and by the proportion of patients at low risk as defined by NCCN guidelines.

2931,Treatment alternatives for chronic hepatitis B virus infection: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Treatment options for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have disparate risks and benefits. Interferon has clinically significant side effects, and lamivudine is associated with viral resistance. In contrast, adefovir is safe and has lower viral resistance but is more expensive. The most cost-effective approach is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether and under what circumstances the improved efficacy of adefovir offsets its increased cost compared with lamivudine or interferon. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis stratified by hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status. DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of MEDLINE from 1970 to 2005. TARGET POPULATION: Patients with chronic HBV infection, elevated aminotransferase levels, and no cirrhosis. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. INTERVENTIONS: 1) No HBV treatment (""do nothing"" strategy), 2) interferon monotherapy, 3) lamivudine monotherapy, 4) adefovir monotherapy, or 5) lamivudine with crossover to adefovir upon resistance (""adefovir salvage"" strategy). OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The ""do nothing"" strategy was least effective yet least expensive. Compared with the ""do nothing"" strategy, using interferon cost an incremental 6337 dollars to gain 1 additional QALY. Compared with interferon, the adefovir salvage strategy cost an incremental 8446 dollars per QALY gained. Both the lamivudine and adefovir monotherapy strategies were more expensive yet less effective than the alternative strategies and were therefore dominated. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In sensitivity analysis, interferon was most cost-effective in health care systems with tight budgetary constraints and a high prevalence of HBeAg-negative patients. LIMITATIONS: These results apply only to patients with chronic HBV infection, elevated aminotransferase levels, and no clinical or histologic evidence of cirrhosis. They do not apply to alternative populations. CONCLUSIONS: Neither lamivudine nor adefovir monotherapy is cost-effective in chronic HBV infection. However, a hybrid salvage strategy reserving adefovir only for lamivudine-associated viral resistance may be highly cost-effective across most health care settings.

DESIGN AND SETTING: A cost-utility (Markov) model within the setting of the UK NHS and viewed from a health system perspective was adopted. Transition probabilities and relative risks were estimated from published literature. Costs of drug treatment, outpatient care, bone marrow biopsies, radiography, blood transfusions and inpatient care were obtained from the British National Formulary and local hospital databases. Costs (pound, year 2001-03 values) were discounted at 6%. Quality-of-life (QOL) data were obtained from the published literature and discounted at 1.5%. The main outcome measure was cost per QALY gained. Extensive one-way sensitivity analyses were performed along with probabilistic (stochastic) analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of imatinib, compared with IFNalpha, was pound26,180 per QALY gained (one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from pound19,449 to pound51,870) and compared with hydroxycarbamide was pound86,934 per QALY (one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from pound69,701 to pound147,095) [ pound1=$US1.691=euro1.535 as at 31 December 2002].Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 50% of the ICERs for imatinib, compared with IFNalpha, fell below a threshold of approximately pound31,000 per QALY gained.

2935,Capecitabine plus docetaxel combination therapy,"BACKGROUND: For patients with anthracycline-pretreated metastatic breast carcinoma, capecitabine plus docetaxel significantly increased overall survival compared with docetaxel alone. The current study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the capecitabine/docetaxel combination versus docetaxel monotherapy, comparing the gain in quality-adjusted survival with associated health care costs. METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive 21-day cycles of oral capecitabine 1250 mg/m2 twice daily, on Days 1-14, plus docetaxel 75 mg/m2 Day 1 (n = 255), or docetaxel 100 mg/m2 on Day 1 (n = 256). Health and cost outcomes in the two arms were compared, and cost-effectiveness was estimated. Data on survival time and medical care resource use were prospectively collected in the trial. Costs associated with medical care resource use and quality-of-life adjustments were obtained from the published literature. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Capecitabine/docetaxel increased the median overall survival by 3 months compared with docetaxel alone (14.5 vs. 11.5 months). The mean quality-adjusted survival was increased by 1.8 months in the capecitabine/docetaxel group. The total medical-resource utilization cost per patient was 8.9% higher with the combination: 24,475 dollars for combination therapy versus 22,477 dollars for single-agent docetaxel. The mean cost per QALY gained with combination therapy was 13,558 dollars (standard deviation, 6742 dollars). Cost savings due to reduced docetaxel dose and hospital use were the major cost offsets with the combination. Sensitivity analyses showed that varying the mean hospital cost per day from the 5th to the 95th percentile resulted in cost-utility ratios ranging from 20,326 dollars to as low as 6360 dollars.

2936,Screening for obstructive sleep apnea in stroke patients: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common after acute ischemic stroke and predicts poor stroke recovery, but whether screening for OSA and treatment by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves neurological outcome is unknown. We used a cost-effectiveness model to estimate the magnitude of benefit that would be necessary to make polysomnography (PSG) and OSA treatment cost-effective in stroke patients. METHODS: A decision tree modeled 2 alternative strategies: PSG followed by 3 months of CPAP for those found to have OSA versus no screening. The primary outcome was the utility gained through OSA screening and treatment in relation to 2 common willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Screening resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $49,421 per QALY. Screening is cost-effective as long as the treatment of stroke patients with OSA by CPAP improves patient utilities by >0.2 for a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY and 0.1 for a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY.

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted for different screening strategies in terms of age (60, 65, or 70 years) and risk profiles (all men or specific high-risk groups) of the screened population, and rescreening after 5 or 10 years. These data were analyzed in a Markov simulation cohort model. RESULTS: The cost per life year gained for different screening strategies ranged from US 8,309 dollars to US 14,084 dollars and was estimated at US 10,474 dollars when 65-year-old men were screened once. Screening 60-year-old men was equally cost-effective, with the advantage of more life years gained. We demonstrated a trade-off between high prevalence of AAA and lower life expectancy, eliminating the expected benefits of screening high-risk groups such as smokers (US 10,695 dollars) or cardiovascular patients (US 10,392 dollars). Assuming general population utility resulted in a cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of US 13,900 dollars, whereas a hypothetical 5% reduction in utility among men with a screening-detected AAA raised the cost per QALY gained to US 75,100 dollars. CONCLUSION: This Markov model, which was based on a systematic review of the literature, supplied information on the estimated cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies. Screening men for AAA may be cost-effective in the long-term. Different screening strategies and quality-of-life effects related to screening for AAA need to be evaluated in future clinical studies.",2005-01-01391,15886653,J Vasc Surg,Anders Wanhainen,2005,41 / 5,741-51; discussion 751,No,15886653,"Anders Wanhainen; Jonas Lundkvist; David Bergqvist; Martin Björck; Cost-effectiveness of different screening strategies for abdominal aortic aneurysm, J Vasc Surg, 2005-May; 41(5):0741-5214; 741-51; discussion 751",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ultrasound screening vs. No screening,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,13900,United States,2003,19551.48
2939,Economic evaluation of proton radiation therapy in the treatment of breast cancer,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Proton beam therapy offers potential clinical advantages compared with conventional radiation therapy for many cancer patients. The benefits are mainly a result of a more favourable dose distribution. The treatment cost with proton radiation is higher than for conventional radiation, mainly due to the large investment cost of building a proton therapy facility. It is therefore important to evaluate whether the medical benefits of proton therapy are large enough to justify the higher treatment costs, compared with conventional radiation therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proton therapy in the treatment of 55-year old women with left-sided breast cancer was assessed. A Markov cohort simulation model was used to simulate the life of patients diagnosed with breast cancers and treated with radiation. Cost and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were the primary outcome measures. RESULTS: The study found a cost per QALY gained of 67,000 Euro for the base case analysis of an average breast cancer patient. The cost per QALY gained would, however, be considerably lower if a population with high-risk of developing cardiac disease was treated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were stable and that the risk of cardiac disease was the most important parameter. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that proton therapy for breast cancer can be cost-effective if appropriate risk groups are chosen as targets for the therapy.",2005-01-01392,15885828,Radiother Oncol,Jonas Lundkvist,2005,75 / 2,179-85,No,15885828,"Jonas Lundkvist; Mattias Ekman; Suzanne Rehn Ericsson; Ulf Isacsson; Bengt Jönsson; Bengt Glimelius; Economic evaluation of proton radiation therapy in the treatment of breast cancer, Radiother Oncol, 2005-May; 75(2):0167-8140; 179-85",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Proton radiation vs. Conventional radiation,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,67000,Euro,2002,91124.43
2940,Cost-effectiveness of recommended nurse staffing levels for short-stay skilled nursing facility patients,"BACKGROUND: Among patients in skilled nursing facilities for post-acute care, increased registered nurse, total licensed staff, and nurse assistant staffing is associated with a decreased rate of hospital transfer for selected diagnoses. However, the cost-effectiveness of increasing staffing to recommended levels is unknown. METHODS: Using a Markov cohort simulation, we estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of recommended staffing versus median staffing in patients admitted to skilled nursing facilities for post-acute care. The outcomes of interest were life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of recommended staffing versus median staffing was $321,000 per discounted quality-adjusted life year gained. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to the likelihood of acute hospitalization from the nursing home. The cost-effectiveness ratio was also sensitive to the rapidity with which patients in the recommended staffing scenario recovered health-related quality of life as compared to the median staffing scenario. The cost-effectiveness ratio was not sensitive to other parameters. CONCLUSION: Adopting recommended nurse staffing for short-stay nursing home patients cannot be justified on the basis of decreased hospital transfer rates alone, except in facilities with high baseline hospital transfer rates. Increasing nurse staffing would be justified if health-related quality of life of nursing home patients improved substantially from greater nurse and nurse assistant presence.",2005-01-01393,15885148,BMC Health Serv Res,David A Ganz,2005,5 / 1,35,Yes,15885148,"David A Ganz; Sandra F Simmons; John F Schnelle; Cost-effectiveness of recommended nurse staffing levels for short-stay skilled nursing facility patients, BMC Health Serv Res, 2005-May-10; 5(1):1472-6963; 35",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Recommended nurse staffing levels vs. Median nurse staffing levels,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,321000,United States,2002,461802.84
2941,Modelling the long term cost effectiveness of clopidogrel for the secondary prevention of occlusive vascular events in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the long term cost effectiveness of clopidogrel monotherapy compared with acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin; ASA) monotherapy in patients at risk of secondary occlusive vascular events (OVEs) in the UK. DESIGN: Cost utility analysis based on clinical data from CAPRIE (a multicentre randomised controlled trial, involving 19185 patients); long-term effects were extrapolated beyond the trial period using a Markov model populated with data from UK observational studies. Health economic evaluation carried out from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. PARTICIPANTS: A representative cohort of 1000 UK patients aged 60 years (approximate mean age of the CAPRIE population), with the qualifying diagnoses of myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease, who are at risk of secondary OVEs (non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or vascular death). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were assumed to receive treatment with either clopidogrel (75 mg/day) for 2 years followed by ASA (325 mg/day, average) for their remaining lifetime, or ASA alone (325 mg/day, average) for life. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost per life year gained and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost effectiveness of clopidogrel versus ASA in this population is estimated at 18888 pounds per life year gained and 21 489 pounds per QALY gained. Multiple deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggest the model is robust to variations in a wide range of input parameters.

2942,Assessing the cost-effectiveness of COX-2 specific inhibitors for arthritis in the Veterans Health Administration,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of cyclooxygenase-2 specific (COX-2) inhibitors (rofecoxib and celecoxib) over nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in high-risk arthritis patients from the perspective of the Veterans Health Administration (VA). METHODS: This literature-based economic analysis (with data summarized from MEDLINE-indexed and other published sources, FDA reports, and data on file at VA San Diego Healthcare System) compared rofecoxib and celecoxib to NSAIDS in two arthritis patient populations considered at higher risk of developing clinically significant upper gastrointestinal events (CSUGIEs): (1) patients of any age with previous medical history of perforation/ulcer/bleed (PUB); and (2) patients 65 years and older (regardless of history of PUB). Two outcome measures were reported: (1) incremental cost per CSUGIE averted over 1 year; and (2) incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, considering both the mortality and morbidity associated with gastrointestinal (including CSUGIEs) and cardiovascular-related adverse events. When possible, costs were modeled to reflect the VA perspective. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the analysis. RESULTS: Compared to NSAIDS, rofecoxib and celecoxib increased costs but reduced the incidence of CSUGIE. Cost per CSUGIE avoided were $7476 and $16,379 (in patients with a PUB history) and $14,294 and $18,376 (in patients aged > or = 65 years) for celecoxib and rofecoxib, respectively. In both populations, celecoxib was associated with a cost per QALY less than $50,000. In contrast, rofecoxib was found to cost more and result in a net QALY loss, due in particular to the increase in the risk of cardiovascular complications, and was therefore considered cost-ineffective. Results were most dependent on assumptions about the incidence of cardiovascular events and CSUGIE and the COX-2 inhibitors' acquisition price. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that COX-2 inhibitors may be cost-effective from the perspective of the VA. However, cost-effectiveness appears to depend less on the specific characteristics of the high-risk target population considered but more on the agent evaluated.

2946,CHART in lung cancer: economic evaluation and incentives for implementation,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate the financial consequences and the impact on daily implementation of CHART in lung cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis were performed using Markov models, comparing the early and delayed costs and effects of CHART for NSCLC over a 4-year time span from a societal viewpoint. The outcome estimates were based on the CHART literature, the cost estimates on the standard practice of the Leuven University Hospitals, the radiotherapy costs being derived from an activity-based costing (ABC) programme developed in the department. RESULTS: The additional societal cost per life-year gained was 9164 Euro, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year 11,576 Euro. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results, the incremental cost-utility ratio remaining well under 20,000 Euro/QALY in all tested circumstances. The threshold analyses found the results of the study to be sensitive to the cost of CHART and to the quality of life after treatment. More specifically, standard treatment would become the optimal treatment if CHART would have a higher cost or would result in more long-term side effects. CONCLUSION: CHART should not be denied to patients with NSCLC on the basis of clinical or economic arguments. Other factors such as socio-economical, institutional, practical departmental and physician-bound barriers most probably explain the lack of implementation into daily practice.",2005-01-01397,15878631,Radiother Oncol,Yolande Lievens,2005,75 / 2,171-8,No,15878631,"Yolande Lievens; Katrien Kesteloot; Walter Van den Bogaert; CHART in lung cancer: economic evaluation and incentives for implementation, Radiother Oncol, 2005-May; 75(2):0167-8140; 171-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous hyperfractionated and accelerated radiotherapy (CHART) vs. Conventional radiotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Years,3.00,3.00,11576,Euro,2000,16061.85
2947,Cost-effectiveness of face-to-face smoking cessation interventions: a dynamic modeling study,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of five face-to-face smoking cessation interventions (i.e., minimal counseling by a general practitioner (GP) with, or without nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), intensive counseling with NRT, or bupropion, and telephone counseling) in terms of costs per quitter, costs per life-year gained, and costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. METHODS: Scenarios on increased implementation of smoking cessation interventions were compared with current practice in The Netherlands. One of the five interventions was implemented for a period of 1, 10, or 75 years reaching 25% of the smokers each year. A dynamic population model, the RIVM chronic disease model, was used to project future gains in life-years and QALYs, and savings of health-care costs from a decrease in the incidence of 11 smoking-related diseases over a time horizon of 75 years. This model allows the repetitive application of increased cessation rates to a population with a changing demographic and risk factor mix. Sensitivity analyses were performed for variations in costs, effects, time horizon, program size, and discount rates. RESULTS: Compared with current practice, minimal GP counseling was a dominant intervention, generating both gains in life-years and QALYs and savings that were higher than intervention costs. For the other interventions, incremental costs per QALY gained ranged from about 1100 per thousand for telephone counseling to 4900 per thousand for intensive counseling with nicotine patches or gum for implementation periods of 75 years.

An incremental cost-effectiveness model compared oral ibandronate with i.v. zoledronic acid and i.v. generic pamidronate in female breast cancer patients with metastatic bone disease, undergoing i.v. chemotherapy. METHODS: A global economic model was adapted to the UK National Health Service (NHS), with primary outcomes of direct healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Efficacy, measured as relative risk reduction of skeletal-related events (SREs), was obtained from clinical trials. Resource use data for i.v. bisphosphonates and the cost of managing SREs were obtained from published studies. Hospital management and SRE treatment costs were taken from unit cost databases. Monthly drug acquisition costs were obtained from the British National Formulary. Utility scores were applied to time with/without an SRE to adjust survival for quality of life. Model design and inputs were validated through expert UK clinician review. RESULTS: Total cost, including drug acquisition, was pound386 less per patient with oral ibandronate vs. i.v. zoledronic acid and pound224 less vs. i.v. generic pamidronate.

2953,Cost-utility analysis of salvage cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in children,"BACKGROUND: Indications for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy have expanded to include cardiopulmonary arrest and support after congenital heart surgery. Data from a national registry have reported that cardiac patients have the poorest survival of all extracorporeal membrane oxygenation recipients. Concerns have been raised about the appropriateness of such an aggressive strategy, especially in light of the high costs and potential for long-term neurologic disability. We reviewed our experience with salvage cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to determine the cost-utility, which accounts for both costs and quality of life. METHODS: Medical records of patients with congenital heart disease receiving salvage cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between January 2000 and May 2004 were reviewed. Charges for all medical care after the institution of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were determined and converted to costs by published standards. The quality-of-life status of survivors was determined with the Health Utilities Index Mark II. RESULTS: Salvage cardiac extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was instituted in 32 patients (18 for cardiopulmonary arrest and 14 for cardiac failure after heart surgery) at a median age of 2.0 months (range, 4 days to 5.1 years). Congenital heart disease was present in 27 (84%). The mean duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was 5.1 +/- 4.1 days. Survival to hospital discharge was 50%, including 1 patient bridged to heart transplantation. Survival to 1 year was 47%. The mean score of the Health Utilities Index for the survivors was 0.75 +/- 0.19 (range, 0.41-1.0). The median cost for hospital stay after the institution of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was USD 156,324 per patient. The calculated cost-utility for salvage extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in this population was USD 24,386 per quality-adjusted life-year saved, which would be considered within the range of accepted cost-efficacy (< USD 50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved).

2954,Cost-effectiveness of alendronate therapy for osteopenic postmenopausal women,"BACKGROUND: Treatment guidelines recommend drug treatment to prevent fractures for some postmenopausal women who have low bone mass (osteopenia) but do not have osteoporosis or a history of clinical fractures. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the societal costs and health benefits of alendronate drug treatment to prevent fractures in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. DESIGN: Markov model with 8 health states: no fracture, post-distal forearm fracture, post-clinical vertebral fracture, post-radiographic (but clinically inapparent) vertebral fracture, post-hip fracture, post-hip and vertebral fractures, post-other fracture, and death. DATA SOURCES: Population-based studies of age-specific fracture rates and costs, prospectively measured estimates of disutility after fractures, and the Fracture Intervention Trial of alendronate versus placebo to prevent fracture. TARGET POPULATION: Postmenopausal women 55 to 75 years of age with femoral neck T-scores between -1.5 and -2.4. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Five years of alendronate therapy or no drug treatment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: For women with no additional fracture risk factors, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained ranged from 70,000 dollars to 332,000 dollars, depending on age and femoral neck bone density. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Results were sensitive to changes in fracture risk reduction attributable to alendronate and alendronate cost. LIMITATIONS: Results apply only to postmenopausal white women residing in the United States. CONCLUSION: Alendronate therapy for postmenopausal women with femoral neck T-scores better than -2.5 and no history of clinical fractures or other bone mineral density-independent risk factors for fracture is not cost-effective, assuming U.S. costs of alendronate and currently available estimates of alendronate efficacy in osteopenic women.",2005-01-01405,15867405,Ann Intern Med,John T Schousboe,2005,142 / 9,734-41,No,15867405,"John T Schousboe; John A Nyman; Robert L Kane; Kristine E Ensrud; Cost-effectiveness of alendronate therapy for osteopenic postmenopausal women, Ann Intern Med, 2005-May-03; 142(9):1539-3704; 734-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Aledronate prophylaxis (5 years) vs. No drug therapy,Not Stated,75 Years,55 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,92409,United States,2001,135044.98

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare the projected health and economic impact of MCV-4 vaccination of US adolescents, toddlers, and infants. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective based on data from Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs) and other published and unpublished sources. Sensitivity analyses in which key input measures were varied over plausible ranges were performed. SETTING AND PATIENTS: A hypothetical 2003 US population cohort of children 11 years of age and a 2003 US birth cohort. INTERVENTIONS: Hypothetical routine vaccination of adolescents (1 dose at 11 years of age), toddlers (1 dose at 1 year of age), and infants (3 doses at 2, 4, and 6 months of age). Each vaccination scenario was compared with a ""no-vaccination"" scenario. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Meningococcal cases and deaths prevented, cost per case prevented, cost per life-year saved, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved. RESULTS: Routine MCV-4 vaccination of US adolescents (11 years of age) would prevent 270 meningococcal cases and 36 deaths in the vaccinated cohort over 22 years, a decrease of 46% in the expected burden of disease. Before program costs are counted, adolescent vaccination would reduce direct disease costs by $18 million and decrease productivity losses by $50 million.

2961,Cost-effectiveness of alendronate in the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in Danish women,"Pharmacological interventions for osteoporosis may reduce morbidity and mortality, but they incur additional health care costs. The aim was to quantify the additional costs and health benefits of prescribing alendronate 10 mg and calcium/vitamin D daily for 71-year-old women with a fracture risk twice that of the population average in stead of calcium/vitamin D alone. A state transition model based primarily on Scandinavian data was developed. Women were followed from age of 71 years until 100. Alendronate was assumed to reduce the fracture risk by 50%. Health benefits from the interventions were expressed in terms of life years, quality adjusted life years, and fractures avoided. Societal costs were estimated using literature estimates and Danish tariffs. All costs were measured in 2002 Danish Kroner (DKK). Future costs and benefits were discounted at 5% per year. The incremental cost per QALY gained was DKK125,000 while the cost per life year gained was DKK 374,000. The use of alendronate was cost-saving when 1) the treatment was extended to five years, 2) the risk of fracture was four times the population average, 3) the effect of alendronate was assumed to persist for three years after discontinuation of treatment, 4) a greater proportion had severe sequelae after a hip fracture, or 5) the start of therapy was delayed until age of 77 years.

2962,Modelling cost effectiveness and cost utility of sequential DMARD therapy including leflunomide for rheumatoid arthritis in Germany: II. The contribution of leflunomide to efficiency,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the 3-year incremental cost effectiveness and cost utility of introducing leflunomide into sequential therapy, consisting of the most frequently used disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), for patients with rheumatoid arthritis in specialised, i.e. rheumatological, care in Germany. DESIGN AND SETTING: The analysis was conducted from the societal perspective in Germany using an existing 3-year simulation model, which was adapted to the German healthcare system after secondary analysis of relevant publications and data. DMARD sequences including leflunomide were compared with those excluding leflunomide. Costs comprised direct costs incurred by treatment and indirect costs incurred by loss of productivity (sick leave and premature retirement) of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Effectiveness parameters were given by response years gained (RYGs) according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for 20%, 50% and 70% improvement (ACR20/50/70RYGs) and by QALYs gained (QALYGs). Costs, effects and QALYs were discounted by 5% per annum. In the base-case analysis, average values of costs, response years and QALYs were applied. Costs were in 1998-2001 values (euro 1 approximately equal to $US 0.91, average of the period from the year 2000 through 2001). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: After 3 years, adding leflunomide was less costly and more effective than the strategy excluding leflunomide when total (direct and indirect) costs were considered. There were savings of euro 271,777 and 8.1, 4.3, 5.1 and 4.9 ACR20RYGs, ACR50RYGs, ACR70RYGs and QALYGs per 100 patients, respectively, obtained through adding leflunomide. Focusing on direct costs, adding leflunomide was more costly and more effective compared with excluding leflunomide, with an incremental cost effectiveness of euro 5004 per ACR20RYG, euro 9535 per ACR50RYG, euro 7996 per ACR70RYG, and an incremental cost utility of euro8301 per QALYG, after 3 years. The robustness of the results was shown in comprehensive sensitivity analyses. In the analysis of extremes, different combinations of the limits of cost, effectiveness and utility parameters were investigated. Adding leflunomide to sequential DMARD therapy remained dominant in 79% of the possible cases, i.e. was less costly and more effective than the strategy excluding leflunomide. Focusing on direct costs, adding leflunomide became dominant in 29% and remained more costly and more effective in 50% of possible cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests, with its underlying data and assumptions, that having leflunomide as an additional option in a DMARD treatment sequence extends the time patients benefit from DMARD therapy at reasonable additional direct costs. Adding leflunomide may even be cost saving when total (direct and indirect) costs are considered. As data on DMARD effectiveness were extracted from the results of clinical trials, real-world data from observational studies would be needed to corroborate the findings of the present analysis.",2005-01-01416,15853438,Pharmacoeconomics,Peter K Schädlich,2005,23 / 4,395-420,Yes,15853438,"Peter K Schädlich; Henning Zeidler; Angela Zink; Erika Gromnica-Ihle; Matthias Schneider; Christoph Straub; Josef G Brecht; Eduard Huppertz; Modelling cost effectiveness and cost utility of sequential DMARD therapy including leflunomide for rheumatoid arthritis in Germany: II.

2963,Cost-effectiveness of orlistat for the treatment of overweight and obese patients in Ireland,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of orlistat plus a calorie-controlled diet compared with a calorie-controlled diet alone for the treatment of overweight and obese patients in Ireland. DESIGN: Economic modelling techniques using published international efficacy data and Irish cost data were used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of orlistat in obese patients when only responders to treatment (ie achieve 5% weight loss after 3 months of treatment) continue orlistat after 3 months. The model incorporated known relationships between weight loss and quality of life (utility) gain, and weight loss and reduction in risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) to predict the impact of weight loss on quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) gained and on the onset of T2DM. The costs associated with each treatment arm included the acquisition cost of orlistat, cost of a calorie-controlled dietary programme and monitoring and treatment costs associated with T2DM. An Irish health-care perspective was taken for the analysis, based on 2003 costs. SUBJECTS: Weight loss data on 1386 patients from five pivotal orlistat clinical trials with at least 12 months duration were pooled (two American and three primarily European studies). All the studies were randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials with a similar design. The inclusion criteria were BMI > or =28 kg / m(2), age > or =18 y, no diagnosed T2DM and the ability to lose 2.5 kg in weight during the introductory period. MEASUREMENTS: Cost effectiveness was modelled from these data and presented as incremental cost per QALY. RESULTS: When orlistat treatment plus a calorie-controlled diet was compared with a calorie-controlled diet alone, the incremental cost per year was euro 478. The number needed to treat (NNT) to gain one QALY was estimated to be 35. The incremental cost per QALY gained was within the range considered cost-effective at euro 16,954. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated an incremental cost per QALY of euro 11,000-35,000 under a variety of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that orlistat is effective and cost-effective in obese patients, if after 3 months of treatment, only treatment responders continue treatment.",2005-01-01419,15852050,Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord,L A Lacey,2005,29 / 8,975-82,No,15852050,"L A Lacey; A Wolf; D O'shea; S Erny; J Ruof; Cost-effectiveness of orlistat for the treatment of overweight and obese patients in Ireland, Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord, 2005-Aug; 29(8):0307-0565; 975-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Orlistat plus a calorie-controlled diet vs. A calorie-controlled diet alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,11 Years,3.00,3.00,16954,Euro,2003,26996.38
2964,Cost-effectiveness of enfuvirtide in treatment-experienced patients with advanced HIV disease,"OBJECTIVE: Enfuvirtide (ENF) has been shown to improve short-term virologic responses when given to highly treatment-experienced patients with advanced HIV disease. Because of the high cost of ENF compared with other antiretroviral agents, our objectives were to determine the potential long-term clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of ENF in these patients. METHODS: We used a computer simulation model of HIV disease to project life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cost, and cost-effectiveness of ENF in treatment-experienced patients. Input data were from the T-20 versus Optimized Regimen Only (TORO) 1 and 2 trials, 2 studies comparing ENF plus an optimized background regimen (OBR) with an OBR alone. RESULTS: ENF plus an OBR increased projected discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy from 45.4 months with an OBR alone to 54.9 months, a difference of 9.5 quality-adjusted life-months. At the current annual ENF cost of US 18,500 dollars per year (in 2001 US dollars), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ENF plus an OBR was US 69,500 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with an OBR alone. When 48-week virologic suppression rates for ENF plus an OBR were varied from a 50% reduction to a 250% increase in the suppression rate attributable to ENF, gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy ranged from 4.5 to 25.9 quality-adjusted life-months compared with an OBR alone, with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from US 97,900 dollars per QALY to US 52,300 dollars per QALY gained. If ENF is continued after the HIV RNA level returns to the pretreatment baseline, the cost-effectiveness ratio increases to US 168,200 dollars per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: In highly treatment-experienced patients, ENF plus an OBR provides substantial gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with an OBR alone. Although ENF plus an OBR is less cost-effective than other commonly used interventions in HIV disease, its use may be justified, given the poor prognosis of these patients and their otherwise limited options for antiretroviral therapy.",2005-01-01420,15851916,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Paul E Sax,2005,39 / 1,69-77,No,15851916,"Paul E Sax; Elena Losina; Milton C Weinstein; A David Paltiel; Sue J Goldie; Tammy M Muccio; April D Kimmel; Hong Zhang; Kenneth A Freedberg; Rochelle P Walensky; Cost-effectiveness of enfuvirtide in treatment-experienced patients with advanced HIV disease, J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr, 2005-May-01; 39(1):1525-4135; 69-77",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Enfuvirtide plus optimized background regimen vs. Optimized background regimen only,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,69500,United States,2001,101566.15
2965,Routine hepatitis C virus screening in pregnancy: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether routine hepatitis C virus screening in pregnancy is cost-effective. STUDY DESIGN: A decision tree with Markov analysis was developed to compare 3 approaches to asymptomatic hepatitis C virus infection in low-risk pregnant women: (1) no hepatitis C virus screening, (2) hepatitis C virus screening and subsequent treatment for progressive disease, and (3) hepatitis C virus screening, subsequent treatment for progressive disease, and elective cesarean delivery to avert perinatal transmission. Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years were evaluated for mother and child. RESULTS: In our base case, hepatitis C virus screening and subsequent treatment of progressive disease was dominated (more costly and less effective) by no screening, with an incremental cost of 108 US dollars and a decreased incremental effectiveness of 0.00011 quality-adjusted life years. When compared with no screening, the marginal cost and effectiveness of screening, treatment, and cesarean delivery was 117 US dollars and 0.00010 quality-adjusted life years, respectively, which yields a cost-effectiveness ratio of 1,170,000 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year.

2967,Probabilistic Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of bronchodilator therapy in COPD patients in different countries,"OBJECTIVES: The development of a probabilistic Markov model with a time horizon of 1 year to compare the cost-effectiveness of three bronchodilators: 1) the new long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium; 2) the short-acting anticholinergic ipratropium; and 3) the long-acting beta 2-agonist salmeterol, for the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in different countries. In this article we compare The Netherlands and Canada. METHODS: The Markov model was structured along disease severity states and exacerbations. Transition probabilities between disease states and exacerbation probabilities were derived from patient-level data from six randomized controlled trials assessing the efficacy and safety of tiotropium. Resource utilization during exacerbations and maintenance treatment for The Netherlands were derived from two clinical trials, whereas for Canada these data were obtained from a countrywide observational study that used similar inclusion criteria as the trials. Second-order Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken in which values were randomly drawn from distributions of these parameters. Outcomes of the model are yearly treatment costs, exacerbations, and quality-adjusted life months. RESULTS: The mean difference in the number of exacerbations was 0.17 (95% uncertainty interval: -0.02-0.37) in favor of tiotropium when compared with salmeterol and the difference between salmeterol and ipratropium was 0.12 (-0.17-0.44) in favor of salmeterol. The number of quality-adjusted life months did not substantially differ between treatment groups and varied from 8.42 (SE 0.41) in the tiotropium group to 8.17 (0.46) in the salmeterol group and 8.11 (0.50) in the ipratropium group. In The Netherlands, costs in the tiotropium group were 42 Euros (-484-353) lower than in the salmeterol group, whereas costs in the salmeterol group were 128 Euros (-795-457) lower than in the ipratropium group. In Canada, costs were consistently lower than in The Netherlands and nearly the same in all treatment groups. Differences between the two countries were primarily a result of a higher length of hospital stay in case of an exacerbation in The Netherlands. The cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier of exacerbations showed that tiotropium was associated with the maximum expected net benefit for all values of the ceiling ratio above 0 Euros (The Netherlands) and 10 Euros (Canada) in the base case analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This probabilistic model-based economic evaluation demonstrates how clinical trial data can be combined and integrated with country-specific information about resource utilization and unit cost to assess the cost-effectiveness of bronchodilators in COPD patients.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for prophylaxis and treatment of an aerosolized B. anthracis bioterror attack. DESIGN: Decision analytic model. DATA SOURCES: We derived probabilities of anthrax exposure, vaccine and treatment characteristics, and their costs and associated clinical outcomes from the medical literature and bioterrorism-preparedness experts. TARGET POPULATION: Persons living and working in a large metropolitan U.S. city. TIME HORIZON: Patient lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: We evaluated 4 postattack strategies: no prophylaxis, vaccination alone, antibiotic prophylaxis alone, or vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis, as well as preattack vaccination versus no vaccination.

RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: If an aerosolized B. anthracis bioweapon attack occurs, postexposure prophylactic vaccination and antibiotic therapy for those potentially exposed is the most effective (0.33 life-year gained per person) and least costly (355 dollars saved per person) strategy, as compared with vaccination alone. At low baseline probabilities of attack and exposure, mass previous vaccination of a metropolitan population is more costly (815 million dollars for a city of 5 million people) and not more effective than no vaccination.

2973,Cost-effectiveness of defending against bioterrorism: a comparison of vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis against anthrax,"BACKGROUND: Weaponized Bacillus anthracis is one of the few biological agents that can cause death and disease in sufficient numbers to devastate an urban setting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for prophylaxis and treatment of an aerosolized B. anthracis bioterror attack. DESIGN: Decision analytic model. DATA SOURCES: We derived probabilities of anthrax exposure, vaccine and treatment characteristics, and their costs and associated clinical outcomes from the medical literature and bioterrorism-preparedness experts. TARGET POPULATION: Persons living and working in a large metropolitan U.S. city. TIME HORIZON: Patient lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: We evaluated 4 postattack strategies: no prophylaxis, vaccination alone, antibiotic prophylaxis alone, or vaccination and antibiotic prophylaxis, as well as preattack vaccination versus no vaccination. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years, life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: If an aerosolized B. anthracis bioweapon attack occurs, postexposure prophylactic vaccination and antibiotic therapy for those potentially exposed is the most effective (0.33 life-year gained per person) and least costly (355 dollars saved per person) strategy, as compared with vaccination alone. At low baseline probabilities of attack and exposure, mass previous vaccination of a metropolitan population is more costly (815 million dollars for a city of 5 million people) and not more effective than no vaccination. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: If prophylactic antibiotics cannot be promptly distributed after exposure, previous vaccination may become cost-effective. LIMITATIONS: The probability of exposure and disease critically depends on the probability and mechanism of bioweapon release.

The current study was conducted to explore the relationship between individuals' risk of cardiac arrest and cost-effectiveness of in-home AED deployment. DESIGN: Markov decision model employing a societal perspective. PATIENTS: Four hypothetical cohorts of American adults 60 years of age at progressively greater risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD): 1) all adults (annual probability of SCD 0.4%); 2) adults with multiple SCD risk factors (probability 2%); 3) adults with previous myocardial infarction (probability 4%); and 4) adults with ischemic cardiomyopathy unable to receive an implantable defibrillator (probability 6%). INTERVENTION: Strategy 1: individuals suffering an in-home cardiac arrest were treated with emergency medical services equipped with AEDs (EMS-D). Strategy 2: individuals suffering an in-home cardiac arrest received initial treatment with an in-home AED, followed by EMS. RESULTS: Assuming cardiac arrest survival rates of 15% with EMS-D and 30% with AEDs, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained (QALY) of providing in-home AEDs to all adults 60 years of age is 216,000 dollars. Costs of providing in-home AEDs to adults with multiple risk factors (2% probability of SCD), previous myocardial infarction (4% probability), and ischemic cardiomyopathy (6% probability) are 132,000 dollars, 104,000 dollars, and 88,000 dollars, respectively.

Three different policies were evaluated: intensive blood glucose control with sulphonylurea/insulin; intensive blood glucose control with metformin for overweight patients; and tight blood pressure control of hypertensive patients. Incremental cost : effectiveness ratios were calculated based on the net cost of healthcare resources associated with these policies and on effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years gained, estimated over a lifetime from within-trial effects using the UKPDS Outcomes Model. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years gained (in year 2004 UK prices) for intensive blood glucose control was 6,028 UK pounds, and for blood pressure control was 369 UK pounds. Metformin therapy was cost-saving and increased quality-adjusted life expectancy.

Participants: Twelve month audit data for 2884 patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting at the Cardiothoracic Centre-Liverpool between January 2000 and December 2002. Main outcome measures: Risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months of index procedure, and reduction in risk from use of drug-eluting stents. Economic modelling used to estimate cost utility ratio and threshold price premium. Results: Four factors were identified in elective patients (n=1951) and two in non-elective patients (n=933) to predict risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months. Most patients fell within the sub-group with lowest risk (57% of electives with 5.6% risk, and 91% of non-electives with 9.9% risk).

Setting: Tertiary care. Participants: Twelve month audit data for 2884 patients receiving percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting at the Cardiothoracic Centre-Liverpool between January 2000 and December 2002. Main outcome measures: Risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months of index procedure, and reduction in risk from use of drug-eluting stents. Economic modelling used to estimate cost utility ratio and threshold price premium. Results: Four factors were identified in elective patients (n=1951) and two in non-elective patients (n=933) to predict risk of repeat revascularisation within 12 months. Most patients fell within the sub-group with lowest risk (57% of electives with 5.6% risk, and 91% of non-electives with 9.9% risk). Modelled cost-utility ratios were acceptable for only one group of high risk non-elective patients (only one patient in audit data). Restricting the number of drug-eluting stents per patient improved results marginally: 4% of stents could then be drug-eluting on economic grounds. The threshold price premium justifying 90% substitution of conventional stents was estimated to be pound112 (sirolimus stents) or pound89 (paclitaxel stents).

2997,Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for lung cancer with low dose spiral CT (computed tomography) in the Australian setting,"INTRODUCTION: Low dose spiral computed tomography (CT) is a sensitive screening tool for lung cancer that is currently being evaluated in both non-randomised studies and randomised controlled trials. METHODS: We conducted a quantitative decision analysis using a Markov model to determine whether, in the Australian setting, offering spiral CT screening for lung cancer to high risk individuals would be cost-effective compared with current practice. This exploratory analysis was undertaken predominantly from the perspective of the government as third-party funder. In the base-case analysis, the costs and health outcomes (life-years saved and quality-adjusted life years) were calculated in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 male current smokers for two alternatives: (1) screen for lung cancer with annual CT for 5 years starting at age 60 year and treat those diagnosed with cancer or (2) no screening and treat only those who present with symptomatic cancer. RESULTS: For male smokers aged 60-64 years, with an annual incidence of lung cancer of 552 per 100,000, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 57,325 dollars per life-year saved and 105,090 dollars per QALY saved. For females aged 60-64 years with the same annual incidence of lung cancer, the cost-effectiveness ratio was 51,001 dollars per life-year saved and 88,583 dollars per QALY saved. The model was used to examine the relationship between efficacy in terms of the expected reduction in lung cancer mortality at 7 years and cost-effectiveness. In the base-case analysis lung cancer mortality was reduced by 27% and all cause mortality by 2.1%. Changes in the estimated proportion of stage I cancers detected by screening had the greatest impact on the efficacy of the intervention and the cost-effectiveness. The results were also sensitive to assumptions about the test performance characteristics of CT scanning, the proportion of lung cancer cases overdiagnosed by screening, intervention rates for benign disease, the discount rate, the cost of CT, the quality of life in individuals with early stage screen-detected cancer and disutility associated with false positive diagnoses. Given current knowledge and practice, even under favourable assumptions, reductions in lung cancer mortality of less than 20% are unlikely to be cost-effective, using a value of 50,000 dollars per life-year saved as the threshold to define a ""cost-effective"" intervention. CONCLUSION: The most feasible scenario under which CT screening for lung cancer could be cost-effective would be if very high-risk individuals are targeted and screening is either highly effective or CT screening costs fall substantially.",2005-01-01443,15829317,Lung Cancer,Renee Manser,2005,48 / 2,171-85,No,15829317,"Renee Manser; Andrew Dalton; Rob Carter; Graham Byrnes; Mark Elwood; Donald A Campbell; Cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for lung cancer with low dose spiral CT (computed tomography) in the Australian setting, Lung Cancer, 2005-May; 48(2):0169-5002; 171-85",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Spiral computed tomography (CT) followed by treatment vs. No spiral CT,Not Stated,64 Years,60 Years,Male,Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,105090,Australia,2002,82202.92

2999,Management of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: how cost-effective are glycoprotein IIb/IIIA antagonists in the UK National Health Service?,"BACKGROUND: The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (GPAs) represent a new class of drugs to prevent platelet aggregation in the acute treatment of non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE-ACS). Systematic reviews have identified serious limitations in published cost-effectiveness analyses, including a lack of UK-specific studies and an absence of studies comparing different protocols for the use of GPAs. METHODS: A model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of a variety of protocols employing GPAs for patients presenting with NSTE-ACS in the UK. The perspective of the UK National Health Service was adopted, with outcomes in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Four treatment strategies were evaluated: GPAs as part of initial medical management (Strategy 1); GPAs in patients with planned percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs; Strategy 2); GPAs as an adjunct to the PCI procedure (Strategy 3); and no GPAs (Strategy 4). Baseline event rates and costs were taken from a UK observational study of ACS patients and relative risk reductions from GPAs were taken from a meta analysis of trials. Long-term costs and QALYs were estimated using data from a UK longitudinal study. RESULTS: The most cost-effective use of GPAs is likely to be Strategy 1, with an incremental cost per QALY gained of between pound4605 to pound10,343. Focusing this use of GPAs only on the subgroup of patients at high risk appears to represent the most cost-effective use of NHS resources.
