12701,Cost-effectiveness Analysis Comparing Apixaban and Acenocoumarol in the Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in Spain,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness analysis of apixaban (5mg twice daily) vs acenocoumarol (5mg/day) in the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in Spain. METHODS: Markov model covering the patient's entire lifespan with 10 health states. Data on the efficacy and safety of the drugs were provided by the ARISTOTLE trial. Warfarin and acenocoumarol were assumed to have therapeutic equivalence. PERSPECTIVES: The Spanish National Health System and society. Information on the cost of the drugs, complications, and the management of the disease was obtained from Spanish sources. RESULTS: In a cohort of 1000 patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, administration of apixaban rather than acenocoumarol would avoid 18 strokes, 71 hemorrhages (28 intracranial or major), 2 myocardial infarctions, 1 systemic embolism, and 23 related deaths. Apixaban would prolong life (by 0.187 years) and result in more quality-adjusted life years (by 0.194 years) per patient. With apixaban, the incremental costs for the Spanish National Health System and for society would be euro 2488 and euro 1826 per patient, respectively. Consequently, the costs per life year gained would be euro 13 305 and euro 9765 and the costs per quality-adjusted life year gained would be euro 12 825 and euro 9412 for the Spanish National Health System and for society, respectively. The stability of the baseline case was confirmed by sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: According to this analysis, apixaban may be cost-effective in the prevention of stroke in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation compared with acenocoumarol.",2014-01-15426,25498373,Rev Esp Cardiol (Engl Ed),Gonzalo Baron Esquivias,2015,68 / 8,,No,25498373,"Gonzalo Baron Esquivias; Gines Escolar Albaladejo; Jose Luis Zamorano; Lourdes Betegon Nicolas; Cristina Canal Fontcuberta; Marina de Salas-Cansado; Dario Rubio-Rodriguez; Carlos Rubio-Terres; Cost-effectiveness Analysis Comparing Apixaban and Acenocoumarol in the Prevention of Stroke in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in Spain, Rev Esp Cardiol (Engl Ed), 2015 Aug; 68(8):1885-5857",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Acenocoumarol,Not Stated,76 Years,63 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,12825,Euro,2012,18589.94
12702,A cost-effectiveness analysis of the first federally funded antismoking campaign,"BACKGROUND: In 2012, CDC launched the first federally funded national mass media antismoking campaign. The Tips From Former Smokers (Tips) campaign resulted in a 12% relative increase in population-level quit attempts. PURPOSE: Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in 2013 to evaluate Tips from a funding agency's perspective. METHODS: Estimates of sustained cessations; premature deaths averted; undiscounted life years (LYs) saved; and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by Tips were estimated. RESULTS: Tips saved about 179,099 QALYs and prevented 17,109 premature deaths in the U.S. With the campaign cost of roughly $48 million, Tips spent approximately $480 per quitter, $2,819 per premature death averted, $393 per LY saved, and $268 per QALY gained.

12703,Cost-effectiveness of telaprevir in patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C in Australia,"BACKGROUND: Protease inhibitors such as telaprevir (Incivo) are reimbursed in Australia for the treatment of patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR). OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of telaprevir plus PR compared with PR alone in 1) previously untreated patients and 2) patients who had received treatment with PR earlier. METHODS: Sustained virological response rates and average treatment durations of telaprevir and PR (given with or without telaprevir) were taken from the telaprevir ADVANCE and REALIZE clinical trials but were modified to take account of differences in prescribing rules between the trials and Australian clinical practice. The probability of transitioning between Markov disease states was based on data from the Australian Kirby Institute where possible and supplemented using data from the published literature. Utility values obtained from the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire data collected in the ADVANCE and REALIZE trials were used to represent the utility during HCV treatment. Utility values for Markov health states were taken from the published literature. Unit costs (2014 AU $) were taken from Australian sources. RESULTS: In treatment-naive patients, the discounted cost per life-years gained was AU $37,706 and the discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year was AU $19,283. In treatment-experienced patients, the discounted cost per life-year gained was AU $23,855 and the discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year was AU $14,948.

12704,Interspinous process devices versus standard conventional surgical decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis: cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: In the 1980s, a new implant was developed to treat patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication caused by lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). This implant is now widely used. PURPOSE: The objective of this study is to determine whether a favorable cost-effectiveness for interspinous process devices (IPDs) compared with conventional bony decompression is attained. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Cost-utility analysis was performed alongside a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Five neurosurgical centers (including one academic and four secondary level care centers) included participants for this study. PATIENT SAMPLE: One hundred fifty-nine patients with LSS were treated with the implantation of IPD and with bony decompression. Eighty participants received an IPD, and seventy-nine participants underwent spinal bony decompression. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and societal costs in the first year (estimated per quarter), estimated from patient-reported utilities (US and The Netherlands EuroQol 5D [EQ-5D] and EuroQol visual analog scale) and diaries on costs (health-care costs, patient costs, and productivity costs). METHODS: All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. Given the statistical uncertainty of differences between costs and QALYs, cost-effectiveness acceptability curves graph the probability that a strategy is cost effective, as a function of willingness to pay. Paradigm Spine funded this trial but did not have any part in data analysis or the design and preparation of this article. RESULTS: According to the EQ-5D, the valuation of quality of life after IPD and decompression was not different. Mean utilities during all four quarters were, not significantly, less favorable after IPD according to the EQ-5D with a decrease in QALYs according to the US EQ-5D of 0.024 (95% confidence interval, -0.031 to 0.079). From a health-care perspective, the costs of IPD treatment were higher (difference euro3,030 per patient, 95% confidence interval, euro561-euro5,498). This significant difference is mainly because of additional cost of implants of euro2,350 apiece. From a societal perspective, a nonsignificant difference of euro2,762 (95% confidence interval, -euro1,572 to euro7,095) in favor of conventional bony decompression was found. CONCLUSIONS: Implantation of IPD as indirect decompressing device is highly unlikely to be cost effective compared with bony decompression for patients with intermittent neurogenic claudication caused by LSS.

12705,The Community Diabetes Education (CoDE) program: cost-effectiveness and health outcomes,"BACKGROUND: Limited evidence exists regarding the long-term effects of community health worker-led diabetes management programs on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness, particularly in low-income, ethnic minority populations. PURPOSE: To examine the long-term cost-effectiveness and improvements in diabetes-related complications of a diabetes education and management intervention led by community health workers among uninsured Mexican Americans. METHODS: Clinical data, changes in hemoglobin A1c over 12 months, and costs from an RCT of 180 uninsured Mexican Americans with type 2 diabetes conducted in 2006 were utilized for secondary analyses in 2012. Simulation modeling was used to estimate long-term cost and health outcomes using the validated Archimedes Model. The absolute differences for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cumulative incidence of diabetes-related complications were derived by comparing intervention and control groups. RESULTS: During a 20-year time horizon, participants who received the intervention would be expected to have significantly lower hemoglobin A1c levels (p<0.001), fewer foot ulcers (p<0.001), and a reduced number of foot amputations (p=0.005) in comparison with a control group receiving usual medical care. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $355 per quality-adjusted life year gained was estimated for intervention participants during the same time period.

12706,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing in Thailand,"INTRODUCTION: Pharmacogenetic (PGx) test is a useful tool for guiding physician on an initiation of an optimal warfarin dose. To implement of such strategy, the evidence on the economic value is needed. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of PGx-guided warfarin dosing compared with usual care (UC). METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to compare projected lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued to warfarin users through PGx or UC for a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 patients. The model was populated with relevant information from systematic review, and electronic hospital-database. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated based on healthcare system and societal perspectives. All costs were presented at year 2013. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: From healthcare system perspective, PGx increases QALY by 0.002 and cost by 2,959 THB (99 USD) compared with UC. Thus, the ICER is 1,477,042 THB (49,234 USD) per QALY gained. From societal perspective, PGx results in 0.002 QALY gained, and increases costs by 2,953 THB (98 USD) compared with UC (ICER 1,473,852 THB [49,128 USD] per QALY gained). Results are sensitive to the risk ratio (RR) of major bleeding in VKORC1 variant, the efficacy of PGx-guided dosing, and the cost of PGx test. CONCLUSION: Our finding suggests that PGx-guided warfarin dosing is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention in Thailand. This evidence assists policy makers and clinicians in efficiently allocating scarce resources.",2014-01-15446,25456732,Thromb Res,Huey Yi Chong,2014,134 / 6,1278-84,No,25456732,"Huey Yi Chong; Surasak Saokaew; Kuntika Dumrongprat; Unchalee Permsuwan; David Bin-Chia Wu; Piyamitr Sritara; Nathorn Chaiyakunapruk; Cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmacogenetic-guided warfarin dosing in Thailand, Thromb Res, ; 134(6):1879-2472; 1278-84",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pharmacogenetic (PGx)-guided warfarin vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1473851,Thailand,2013,53403.2
12707,The cost-effectiveness of interbody fusions versus posterolateral fusions in 137 patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Reimbursements for interbody fusions have declined recently because of their questionable cost-effectiveness. PURPOSE: A Markov model was adopted to compare the cost-effectiveness of posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (/TLIF) versus noninterbody fusion and posterolateral fusion (PLF) in patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Decision model analysis based on retrospective data from a single institutional series. PATIENT SAMPLE: One hundred thirty-seven patients underwent first-time instrumented lumbar fusions for degenerative or isthmic spondylolisthesis. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life adjustments and expenditures were assigned to each short-term complication (durotomy, surgical site infection, and medical complication) and long-term outcome (bowel/bladder dysfunction and paraplegia, neurologic deficit, and chronic back pain). METHODS: Patients were divided into a PLF cohort and a PLF plus PLIF/TLIF cohort. Anterior techniques and multilevel interbody fusions were excluded. Each short-term complication and long-term outcome was assigned a numerical quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), based on time trade-off values in the Beaver Dam Health Outcomes Study. The cost data for short-term complications were calculated from charges accrued by the institution's finance sector, and the cost data for long-term outcomes were estimated from the literature. The difference in cost of PLF plus PLIF/TLIF from the cost of PLF alone divided by the difference in QALY equals the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER). We do not report any study funding sources or any study-specific appraisal of potential conflict of interest-associated biases in this article. RESULTS: Of 137 first-time lumbar fusions for spondylolisthesis, 83 patients underwent PLF and 54 underwent PLIF/TLIF. The average time to reoperation was 3.5 years. The mean QALY over 3.5 years was 2.81 in the PLF cohort versus 2.66 in the PLIFo/TLIF cohort (p=.110). The mean 3.5-year costs of $54,827.05 after index interbody fusion were statistically higher than that of the $48,822.76 after PLF (p=.042). The CER of interbody fusion to PLF after the first operation was -$46,699.40 per QALY; however, of the 27 patients requiring reoperation, the incident (reoperation) rate ratio was 7.89 times higher after PLF (2.91, 26.67). The CER after the first reoperation was -$24,429.04 per QALY (relative to PLF). Two patients in the PLF cohort required a second reoperation, whereas none required a second reoperation in the PLIF/TLIF cohort. Taken collectively, the total CER for the interbody fusion is $9,883.97 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The reoperation rate was statistically higher for PLF, whereas the negative CER for the initial operation and first reoperation favors PLF. However, when second reoperations were included, the CER for the interbody fusion became $9,883.97 per QALY, suggesting moderate long-term cost savings and better functional outcomes with the interbody fusion.",2014-01-15453,25463402,Spine J,Mohamad Bydon,2015,15 / 3,,No,25463402,"Mohamad Bydon; Mohamed Macki; Nicholas B Abt; Timothy F Witham; Jean-Paul Wolinsky; Ziya L Gokaslan; Ali Bydon; Daniel M Sciubba; The cost-effectiveness of interbody fusions versus posterolateral fusions in 137 patients with lumbar spondylolisthesis, Spine J, 2015 Mar 1; 15(3):1529-9430",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Posterolateral fusion plus posterior lumbar interbody fusion / transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for Initial cohort vs. Posterolateral fusion for initial cohort,Not Stated,72 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-46699.4,United States,2010,-55427.59

12709,Vagus nerve stimulation therapy in a developing country: a long term follow up study and cost utility analysis,"PURPOSE: To evaluate clinical outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), cost effectiveness and cost utility associated with VNS therapy in children with refractory epilepsy in a developing country. METHODS: Retrospective review of all children who underwent VNS implantation at King Abdullah University Hospital and Jordan University Hospital in Jordan. RESULTS: Twenty eight patients (16 males) had implantation of the VNS therapy system between the years 2007 and 2011. Mean age at implantation was 9.4 years. Mean duration of epilepsy prior to implantation was 6.5 years. The most common seizure type was generalized tonic clonic seizures. Fifteen patients showed a 50% or more reduction in seizure frequency. There was a significant reduction in total number of seizures (p=0.002) and emergency room (ER) visits (p=0.042) after VNS therapy. Atonic seizures were more likely to respond than generalized tonic clonic seizures, p=0.034. Direct hospital costs prior to VNS implantation were analyzed in relation to ER visits and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. Cost savings per patient did reduce the financial burden of the device by about 30%. There was a QALY gain per lifetime of 3.78 years for children and 1 year for adolescents. CONCLUSION: Response to VNS implantation in Jordan was favorable and similar to what has been previously reported. QALY gain and cost per QALY analysis were encouraging. Cost savings were related to reduction in seizure severity.

12710,Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node dissection compared to complete lymphadenectomy in the management of early-stage vulvar cancer: A cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is an acceptable method of evaluating groin lymph nodes in women with vulvar cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess the cost and effectiveness of SLNB compared to universal inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (LND) for vulvar cancer. METHODS: A modified Markov decision model was generated to compare two surgical approaches for newly diagnosed, early-stage vulvar cancer: (1) radical vulvectomy+LND and (2) radical vulvectomy+SLNB. Published data were used to estimate survival outcomes, probability of positive lymph nodes and lymphedema. Costs of surgery and radiation and lymphedema therapies were estimated from published data. Lymphedema's effect on quality of life (QOL) was extrapolated from other disease sites and assigned a utility score of 0.84. Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: SLNB was less costly ($13,449 versus $14,261) and more effective (4.16 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus 4.00 QALYs) than LND. The model was sensitive to the impact of lymphedema on QOL. Unless the impact of lymphedema on QOL was minimal (utility score>0.975) SLNB dominated LND. Variations in the rate of positive SLNB and probability of lymphedema over clinically reasonable ranges did not alter the results. CONCLUSIONS: SLNB is a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of newly diagnosed vulvar cancer, mainly due to the impact of lymphedema on QOL.",2014-01-15481,25478927,Gynecol Oncol,Georgia A McCann,2015,136 / 2,,No,25478927,"Georgia A McCann; David E Cohn; Elizabeth L Jewell; Laura J Havrilesky; Lymphatic mapping and sentinel lymph node dissection compared to complete lymphadenectomy in the management of early-stage vulvar cancer: A cost-utility analysis, Gynecol Oncol, 2015 Feb; 136(2):0090-8258",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Radical vulvectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy vs. Radical vulvectomy + universal inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (LND),"Newly diagnosed, early-stage vulvar cancer",Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-5075,United States,2013,-5638.23
12711,Cost-effectiveness of noninvasive central blood pressure monitoring in the diagnosis of hypertension,"BACKGROUND: Central blood pressure (CBP) betters conventional clinical BP (cuff BP) in predicting cardiovascular outcomes. Noninvasive CBP monitoring has emerged as a new technology for management of hypertension. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of noninvasive CBP compared to cuff BP monitoring for confirming a diagnosis of hypertension. METHODS: Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for CBP and cuff BP monitoring using a cohort Markov model. We applied model calibration and probabilistic sensitivity analysis on populations representative of the general population, in 10-year age brackets, from age 35 years to over 75 years of age. RESULTS: The CBP strategy was more cost-effective than cuff BP for men and women across all age subgroups, with mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from pound226 to pound2,750 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness was mainly driven by improved patient outcomes, represented by the QALY gains (0.09-0.88), at an acceptable incremental cost ( pound116- pound371). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the consistency and robustness of the cost-effectiveness of the CBP strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Early evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive CBP monitoring suggests significant improvements in the confirmation of suspected hypertension, compared to cuff BP. This paper suggests that the long-term benefits of improved diagnostic performance justify the supplementary purchase costs of new, noninvasive CBP monitors. The results highlight the potential value of CBP, and hence the value of further research to confirm the diagnostic and prognostic role of CBP for the management of hypertension.",2014-01-15482,25430695,Am J Hypertens,Hao-Min Cheng,2015,28 / 5,,No,25430695,"Hao-Min Cheng; Alan Pearson; Shih-Hsien Sung; Wen-Chung Yu; Chen-Huan Chen; Jonathan Karnon; Cost-effectiveness of noninvasive central blood pressure monitoring in the diagnosis of hypertension, Am J Hypertens, 2015 May; 28(5):0895-7061",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Non-invasive central blood pressure vs. Conventional clinical blood pressure (cuff BP),Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,Male,Full,60 Years,3.50,3.50,546,United Kingdom,2013,948.82

12713,Cost utility analysis of endoscopic biliary stent in unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma: decision analytic modeling approach,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Endoscopic biliary drainage using metal and plastic stent in unresectable hilar cholangiocarcinoma (HCA) is widely used but little is known about their cost-effectiveness. This study evaluated the cost-utility of endoscopic metal and plastic stent drainage in unresectable complex, Bismuth type II-IV, HCA patients. METHODOLOGY: Decision analytic model, Markov model, was used to evaluate cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of endoscopic biliary drainage in unresectable HCA. Costs of treatment and utilities of each Markov state were retrieved from hospital charges and unresectable HCA patients from tertiary care hospital in Thailand, respectively. Transition probabilities were derived from international literature. Base case analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Under the base-case analysis, metal stent is more effective but more expensive than plastic stent. An incremental cost per additional QALY gained is 192,650 baht (US$ 6,318). From probabilistic sensitivity analysis, at the willingness to pay threshold of one and three times GDP per capita or 158,000 baht (US$ 5,182) and 474,000 baht (US$ 15,546), the probability of metal stent being cost-effective is 26.4% and 99.8%, respectively.

12714,Treatment of moderate rheumatoid arthritis with different strategies in a health resource-limited setting: a cost-effectiveness analysis in the era of biosimilars,"OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to explore the cost-effectiveness of reduced doses or discontinuation of etanercept biosimilar (Yisaipu) in patients with moderately active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed to project lifetime medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in moderately active RA. Strategies starting with Yisaipu 50 mg/week for nine months following Yisaipu 50 mg/week, 25 mg/week or MTX maintenance were compared. Resource consumptions related to RA were estimated from the perspective of the Chinese health care system. An endpoint of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response was used to estimate the utility scores. Uncertainty in model parameters was analysed by sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: When using ACR as an endpoint for determining successful treatment, strategies starting with Yisaipu 50 mg/week for nine months following Yisaipu 50 mg/week or 25 mg/week maintenance showed the greatest number of QALYs gained (nearly 11.9 and 11.3 with or without rituximab after the failure of Yisaipu, respectively).

12718,Long-acting olanzapine versus long-acting risperidone for schizophrenia in Spain - a cost-effectiveness comparison,"BACKGROUND: In schizophrenia, medication adherence is critical to achieve better patient outcomes and to avoid relapses, which are responsible for a significant proportion of total healthcare costs for this chronic illness. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of olanzapine long-acting injection (OLAI) compared with risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI) in patients with schizophrenia in Spain. METHODS: A discrete event simulation (DES) model was developed from a Spanish healthcare system perspective to estimate clinical and economic outcomes for patients with schizophrenia over a five-year period. Patients who had earlier responded to oral medication and have a history of relapse due to adherence problems were considered. Identical model populations were treated with either OLAI or RLAI. In the absence of a head-to-head clinical trial, discontinuation and relapse rates were obtained from open-label studies. The model accounted for age, gender, risks of relapse and discontinuation, relapse management, hospitalization, treatment switching and adverse events. Direct medical costs for the year 2011 and outcomes including relapse avoided, life years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were discounted at a rate of 3%. RESULTS: When comparing RLAI and OLAI, the model predicts that OLAI would decrease 5-year costs by euro2,940 (Standard Deviation between replications 300.83), and result in a QALY and LY gains of 0.07 (SD 0.019) and 0.04 (SD 0.025), respectively. Patients on OLAI had fewer relapses compared to RLAI (1.392 [SD 0.035] vs. 1.815 [SD 0.035]) and fewer discontinuations (1.222 [SD 0.031] vs. 1.710 [SD 0.039]). Sensitivity analysis indicated that the study was robust and conclusions were largely unaffected by changes in a wide range of parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The present evaluation results in OLAI being dominant over RLAI, meaning that OLAI represents a more effective and less costly alternative compared to RLAI in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia in the Spanish setting.",2014-01-15500,25438678,BMC Psychiatry,Tatiana Dilla,2014,14 /,298,No,25438678,"Tatiana Dilla; Jorgen Moller; Paul O'Donohoe; Maria Alvarez; Jose A Sacristan; Michael Happich; Antje Tockhorn; Long-acting olanzapine versus long-acting risperidone for schizophrenia in Spain - a cost-effectiveness comparison, BMC Psychiatry, ; 14():1471-244X; 298",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Olanzapine long-acting injection vs. Risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-41995.29,Euro,2011,-67239.74
12719,Comparison of the cost-effectiveness of new oral anticoagulants for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation in a UK setting,"PURPOSE: Three new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have recently become available in the United Kingdom as an alternative to warfarin in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in atrial fibrillation. This study examines the relative cost-effectiveness of dabigatran (BID dosing of 150 mg or 110 mg based on patient age), rivaroxaban, and apixaban from a UK payer perspective. METHODS: A previously published model that follows up patients through treatment of atrial fibrillation during a lifetime was adapted to allow comparison of the 3 NOACs and warfarin. Acute thromboembolic and bleeding events, as well as long-term consequences of stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and acute myocardial infarction, were tracked. Relative efficacy was calculated from a formal indirect treatment comparison using data from the 3 key trials (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy, Rivaroxaban Once-daily oral direct factor Xa inhibition Compared with vitamin K antagonism for prevention of stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation, and Apixaban for the Prevention of Stroke in Subjects With Atrial Fibrillation) of the NOACs. Data from the rivaroxaban trial were adjusted for the difference in international normalized ratio control among warfarin patients versus the other 2 trials. Model outputs included total costs, event rates, and quality-adjusted life-years. FINDINGS: Among the patients taking NOACs, those taking dabigatran had the highest total QALYs (7.68 QALYs), followed by apixaban (7.63 QALYs) and rivaroxaban (7.47 QALYs). Patients taking dabigatran had the lowest total lifetime costs ( pound23,342), followed by apixaban ( pound24,014) and rivaroxaban ( pound25,220). The differences between dabigatran and apixaban were modest but consistent in sensitivity analyses, with the directionality only changing at the limits of the CIs for the relative risks of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage or when assuming that both treatment discontinuation and post-event disability rates differ by drug.

12722,BRAF mutation in papillary thyroid cancer: A cost-utility analysis of preoperative testing,"BACKGROUND: Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with BRAF mutation carries a poorer prognosis. Prophylactic central neck dissection (CND) reduces locoregional recurrences, and we hypothesize that initial total thyroidectomy (TT) with CND in patients with BRAF-mutated PTC is cost effective. METHODS: This cost-utility analysis is based on a hypothetical cohort of 40-year-old women with small PTC [2 cm, confined to the thyroid, node(-)]. We compared preoperative BRAF testing and TT+CND if BRAF-mutated or TT alone if BRAF-wild type, versus no testing with TT. This analysis took into account treatment costs and opportunity losses. Key variables were subjected to sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Both approaches produced comparable outcomes, with costs of not testing being lower (-$801.51/patient). Preoperative BRAF testing carried an excess expense of $33.96 per quality-adjusted life-year per patient. Sensitivity analyses revealed that when BRAF positivity in the testing population decreases to 30%, or if the overall noncervical recurrence in the population increases above 11.9%, preoperative BRAF testing becomes the more cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSION: Outcomes with or without preoperative BRAF testing are comparable, with no testing being the slightly more cost-effective strategy. Although preoperative BRAF testing helps to identify patients with higher recurrence rates, implementing a more aggressive initial operation does not seem to offer a cost advantage.",2014-01-15517,25444226,Surgery,Wayne S Lee,2014,156 / 6,1569-78,No,25444226,"Wayne S Lee; Barnard J A Palmer; Arturo Garcia; Vincent E Chong; Terrence H Liu; BRAF mutation in papillary thyroid cancer: A cost-utility analysis of preoperative testing, Surgery, ; 156(6):0039-6060; 1569-78",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Preoperative BRAF testing (genetic testing) by fine-needle aspiration vs. None,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,33.96,United States,2010,40.31
12723,Expected cost effectiveness of high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine in US seniors,"OBJECTIVES: Seniors are particularly vulnerable to complications resulting from influenza infection. Numerous influenza vaccines are available to immunize US seniors, and practitioners must decide which product to use. Options include trivalent and quadrivalent standard-dose inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3 and IIV4 respectively), as well as a high-dose IIV3 (HD). Our research examines the public health impact, budget impact, and cost-utility of HD versus IIV3 and IIV4 for immunization of US seniors 65 years of age and older. METHODS: Our model was based on US influenza-related health outcome data. Health care costs and vaccine prices were obtained from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Efficacies of IIV3 and IIV4 were estimated from various meta-analyses of IIV3 efficacy. The results of a head-to-head randomized controlled trial of HD vs. IIV3 were used to estimate relative efficacy of HD. Conservatively, herd protection was not considered. RESULTS: Compared to IIV3, HD would avert 195,958 cases of influenza, 22,567 influenza-related hospitalizations, and 5423 influenza-related deaths among US seniors. HD generates 29,023 more Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and a net societal budget impact of $154 million. The Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for this comparison is $5299/QALY. 71% of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) simulations were <$100,000/QALY. Compared to IIV4, HD would avert 169,257 cases of influenza, 21,222 hospitalizations and 5212 deaths.

12727,Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination in HIV-negative men who have sex with men to prevent recurrent high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia,"We examined the long-term clinical and economic benefits of quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccine as a secondary/adjunct prevention strategy in the prevention of recurrent high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGAIN) in HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) and are 27 years or older. We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two strategies: (1) no qHPV vaccine after treatment for HGAIN versus (2) qHPV vaccine after treatment for HGAIN. Model parameters, including natural history of anal cancer, vaccine efficacy measured in terms of hazard ratio (HR) (decrease in the risk of recurrent HGAIN), HGAIN treatment efficacy, utilities, and costs, were obtained from the literature. The outcomes were measured in terms of lifetime risk of anal cancer, lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Sensitivity analysis was conducted on all model parameters. We found that vaccinating HIV-negative MSM reduced the lifetime risk of anal cancer by 60.77% at an ICER of US$87,240 per quality-adjusted life-year. The results were highly sensitive to vaccine efficacy, transition of HGAIN to anal cancer, cost of treatment for HGAIN, vaccine degree of protection over time, and the vaccine duration of protection and less sensitive to HPV clearance, cost of qHPV vaccine, and the transitions from normal to low-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia (LGAIN) and normal to HGAIN. With an HR of 0.3, the ICER was well below a $50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold; with an HR of 0.5, the ICER was still below a threshold of $100,000. The most critical disease-related factor influencing the cost-effectiveness was the progression of HGAIN to anal cancer. At an annual transition probability below 0.001, the ICER was below $50,000. Vaccinating HIV-negative MSM treated for HGAIN decreases the lifetime risk of anal cancer and is likely to be a cost-effective intervention.",2014-01-15523,25444820,Vaccine,Ashish A Deshmukh,2014,32 / 51,6941-6947,Yes,25444820,"Ashish A Deshmukh; Elizabeth Y Chiao; Prajnan Das; Scott B Cantor; Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccination in HIV-negative men who have sex with men to prevent recurrent high-grade anal intraepithelial neoplasia, Vaccine, 2014 Dec 5; 32(51):1873-2518; 6941-6947",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) Vaccine (gardasin) vs. None,men who have sex with men (MSM),27 Years,27 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,87240,United States,2010,103545.29
12728,Epidural steroids for lumbosacral radicular syndrome compared to usual care: quality of life and cost utility in general practice,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of adding segmental epidural steroid injections (SESIs) to usual care compared with usual care alone on quality of life and cost utility in lumbosacral radicular syndrome (LRS) in general practice. DESIGN: A pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Results were analyzed using mixed models. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=50) in the acute phase of LRS. INTERVENTIONS: One epidural injection containing 80mg of triamcinolone in normal saline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Back pain at 4 weeks after the start of the treatment. RESULTS: Both groups experienced a significant increase in quality of life in (especially) the physical domains of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. The intervention group scored significantly better than the control group at certain time points in the physical domain. The differences were small. The cost-utility analysis showed that with a negligible loss of utility (3d in perfect health), societal costs (193,354 euros per quality-adjusted life year lost) would be saved because of more productivity in the intervention group. CONCLUSIONS: Although the beneficial effects of SESIs are small and the natural course of LRS is predominantly favorable, we think decision makers can consider implementing SESIs in daily practice with the purpose of saving resources. Caution must be taken, and further research should be directed at identifying patient subgroups who might benefit from SESIs, with additional focus on (costs of) complications and adverse effects.",2014-01-15526,25448243,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,Antje Spijker-Huiges,2015,96 / 3,,No,25448243,"Antje Spijker-Huiges; Karin Vermeulen; Jan C Winters; Marten van Wijhe; Klaas van der Meer; Epidural steroids for lumbosacral radicular syndrome compared to usual care: quality of life and cost utility in general practice, Arch Phys Med Rehabil, 2015 Mar; 96(3):0003-9993",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Segmental epidural steroid injections with usual care vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,65 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,193354,Euro,2013,285301.32
12729,A cost-utility analysis of NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group Protocol 218: incorporating prospectively collected quality-of-life scores in an economic model of treatment of ovarian cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate quality-of-life (QOL)-adjusted cost-utility with addition of bevacizumab (B) to intravenous paclitaxel/carboplatin (PC) for primary treatment of advanced-stage epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: A modified Markov state transition model of 3 regimens evaluated in GOG 218 (PC, PC+concurrent B [PCB], and PCB+maintenance B [PCB+B]) was populated by prospectively collected survival, adverse event, and QOL data from GOG 218. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were modeled using primary event data. Costs of grade 4 hypertension, grade 3-5 bowel events, and growth factor support were incorporated. QOL scores were converted to utilities and incorporated into the model. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to account for uncertainty in estimates. RESULTS: PC was the least expensive ($4044) and least effective (mean 1.1 quality-adjusted progression-free years [QA-PFY]) regimen. PCB ($43,703 and 1.13 QA-PFY) was dominated by a combination of PC and PCB+B. PCB+B ($122,700 and 1.25 QA-PFY) was the most expensive regimen with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $792,380/QA-PFY compared to PC.

12731,The cost-effectiveness of selective lymphadenectomy based on a preoperative prediction model in patients with endometrial cancer: insights from the US and Korean healthcare systems,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of selective lymphadenectomy using a preoperative prediction model compared to routine lymphadenectomy for patients undergoing surgery for endometrial cancer in the US and Korea. METHODS: We used a modified Markov model to estimate clinical and economic outcomes for newly diagnosed, apparent early-stage endometrial cancer patients under two different strategies: (1) selective lymphadenectomy, where patients classified as low risk based on the preoperative prediction model did not undergo complete surgical staging, and (2) routine lymphadenectomy, where all patients underwent complete surgical staging. Published data were used to estimate the rates of adjuvant therapy and survival. Costs were calculated from the perspective of US or Korean payers. Cost-effectiveness ratios were analyzed separately using data from each country. RESULTS: Base-case analysis indicated that selective lymphadenectomy was less costly ($6454 vs. $7079 in Korea; $23,995 vs. $26,318 in the US) and more effective (6.91 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) vs. 6.85 QALYs in Korea; 6.87 QALYs vs. 6.81 QALYs in the US) than routine lymphadenectomy in both countries. This result was robust in a deterministic sensitivity analysis, with the exception of when the utility scores for patients with lymphedema were varied. So long as a modest preference for avoiding lymphedema (disutility of 0.04) was obtained, selective lymphadenectomy remained the dominant strategy. CONCLUSIONS: A selective lymphadenectomy strategy based on a preoperative prediction model was shown to be more cost-effective than routine lymphadenectomy for endometrial cancer patients in the US and Korea.",2014-01-15531,25450150,Gynecol Oncol,Jung-Yun Lee,2014,135 / 3,518-24,No,25450150,"Jung-Yun Lee; David E Cohn; Younhee Kim; Tae-Jin Lee; Jason C Barnett; Jae-Weon Kim; Yong Woo Jeon; Kidong Kim; Sang Min Park; Sokbom Kang; The cost-effectiveness of selective lymphadenectomy based on a preoperative prediction model in patients with endometrial cancer: insights from the US and Korean healthcare systems, Gynecol Oncol, ; 135(3):0090-8258; 518-24",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Selective lymphadenectomy vs. Routine lymphadenectomy, where all patients underwent complete surgical staging.","Newly diagnosed, apparently early stage endometrial cancer",60 Years,60 Years,Female,Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,-37168,United States,2012,-41897.82
12732,Economic evaluation of diagnostic localization following biochemical prostate cancer recurrence,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess potential cost-effectiveness of using a prostate cancer specific functional imaging technology capable of identifying residual localized disease versus small volume metastatic disease for asymptomatic men with low but detectable prostate specific antigen (PSA) elevation following radical prostatectomy. METHODS: Markov modeling was used to estimate the incremental impact on healthcare system costs (2012 USD) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of two alternative strategies: (i) using the new diagnostic to guide therapy versus (ii) current usual care-using a combination of computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and bone scan to guide therapy. Costs were based on estimates from literature and Medicare reimbursement. Prostate cancer progression, survival, utilities, and background risk of all-cause mortality were obtained from literature. Base-case diagnostic sensitivity (75 percent), specificity (90 percent), and cost (USD 2,500) were provided by our industry partner GE Healthcare. RESULTS: The new diagnostic strategy provided an average gain of 1.83 (95 percent uncertainty interval [UI]: 1.24-2.64) QALYs with added costs of USD 15,595 (95 percent UI: USD -6,330-44,402) over 35 years. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was USD 8,516/QALY (95 percent UI: USD -2,947-22,372). RESULTS were most influenced by the utility discounting rate and test performance characteristics; however, the new diagnostic provided clinical benefits over a wide range of sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests a diagnostic technology capable of identifying whether men with biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy have localized versus metastatic disease would be a cost-effective alternative to current standard work-up.

METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out to estimate the annual cost and health related quality of life (HRQoL) of 109 patients who underwent coronary revascularization (PCI [n = 75] and CABG [n = 34]). A Markov model has been developed to determine the cost effectiveness of CABG compared with PCI. We used the model to calculate lifetime costs, life-years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of each strategy. We also used probabilistic sensitivity analysis to test model robustness. RESULTS: We found that discounted QALY lived per person in CABG versus PCI group in 5 years, 10 years, and lifetime time horizon were (3.8 +/- 0.13 versus 3.88 +/- 0.14), (6.4 +/- 0.23 versus 6.33 +/- 0.22), and (8.74 +/- 0.29 versus 8.33 +/- 0.27), respectively. The estimated medical cost of CABG and PCI per patient in 5 years, 10 years, and lifetime time horizon were (USD 6,819 +/- 765 versus 9,011 +/- 1,816), (USD 8,852 +/- 1,348 versus 12,034 +/- 2,375), and (USD 14,037+/- 4,201 versus 18,798 +/- 5,821), respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio results showed CABG is a dominate alternative in 10 years and lifetime time horizon.

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with a cost-effectiveness analysis. SUBJECTS: A total of 159 participants randomized into the medical yoga group (n = 52), the exercise therapy group (n = 52) and the self-care advice group (n = 55). METHODS: The health outcome measure EQ-5D was applied to measure quality of life data combined with cost data collected from treatment groups from baseline to 12 months follow-up. Outcome measure was health-related quality of life (HRQL). Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was also calculated. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted primarily from the societal and employer perspectives. RESULTS: Medical yoga is cost-effective compared with self-care advice if an employer considers the significant improvement in the HRQL of an employee with low back pain justifies the additional cost of treatment (i.e. in this study EUR 150). From a societal perspective, medical yoga is a cost-effective treatment compared with exercise therapy and self-care advice if an additional QALY is worth EUR 11,500.

METHODS: The health outcome measure EQ-5D was applied to measure quality of life data combined with cost data collected from treatment groups from baseline to 12 months follow-up. Outcome measure was health-related quality of life (HRQL). Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was also calculated. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted primarily from the societal and employer perspectives. RESULTS: Medical yoga is cost-effective compared with self-care advice if an employer considers the significant improvement in the HRQL of an employee with low back pain justifies the additional cost of treatment (i.e. in this study EUR 150). From a societal perspective, medical yoga is a cost-effective treatment compared with exercise therapy and self-care advice if an additional QALY is worth EUR 11,500. Sensitivity analysis suggests that medical yoga is more cost-effective than its alternatives. CONCLUSION: Six weeks of uninterrupted medical yoga thera-py is a cost-effective early intervention for non-specific low back pain, when treatment recommendations are adhered to.",2014-01-15538,25403347,J Rehabil Med,Emmanuel Aboagye,2015,47 / 2,,No,25403347,"Emmanuel Aboagye; Malin Lohela Karlsson; Jan Hagberg; Irene Jensen; Cost-effectiveness of early interventions for non-specific low back pain: a randomized controlled study investigating medical yoga, exercise therapy and self-care advice, J Rehabil Med, 2015 Feb; 47(2):1650-1977",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Medical yoga vs. Exercise therapy,Not Stated,60 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-66043.48,Euro,2011,-105743.93
12736,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a structured collaborative disease management in the Interdisciplinary Network for Heart Failure (INH) study,"BACKGROUND: Non-pharmacological treatment programmes are being developed, in which specialised nurses take care of heart failure (HF) patients. Such disease management programmes might increase survival and quality of life in HF patients, but evidence on their cost-effectiveness remains limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective economic evaluation piggy-backed onto the randomised controlled Interdisciplinary Network for Heart Failure (INH) Study weighted costs of the intervention HeartNetCare -HF (HNC) regarding effectiveness, mortality and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). To consider uncertainty sensitivity analyses were performed. Compared to usual care (UC), HNC revealed 8,284 <euro> per death avoided within the 6 month study follow-up period. The cost-utility analysis showed additional costs of 49,335 <euro> per QALY. CONCLUSION: Although HNC did not reduce short-term re-admission rates of HF patients hospitalised for cardiac decompensation within the first 180 days after discharge, HNC might reduce mortality and increase quality of life in these patients at reasonable costs. Therefore, long-term HNC-effects deserve further evaluation.",2014-01-15540,25403774,Clin Res Cardiol,Anja Neumann,2015,104 / 4,,No,25403774,"Anja Neumann; Sarah Mostardt; Janine Biermann; Gotz Gelbrich; Alexander Goehler; Benjamin P Geisler; Uwe Siebert; Stefan Stork; Georg Ertl; Christiane E Angerrmann; Jurgen Wasem; Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a structured collaborative disease management in the Interdisciplinary Network for Heart Failure (INH) study, Clin Res Cardiol, 2015 Apr; 104(4):1861-0684",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nurse-led heart failure management program vs. Standard/Usual Care- Not specified,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,22590.91,Euro,2007,38662.2
12737,Cost-effectiveness analysis of prognostic gene expression signature-based stratification of early breast cancer patients,"BACKGROUND: The individual risk of recurrence in hormone receptor-positive primary breast cancer patients determines whether adjuvant endocrine therapy should be combined with chemotherapy. Clinicopathological parameters and molecular tests such as EndoPredict((R)) (EPclin) can support decision making in patients with estrogen receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative cancer. OBJECTIVE: Using a life-long Markov state transition model, we determined the health economic impact and incremental cost effectiveness of EPclin-based risk stratification in combination with clinical guidelines [German-S3, National Comprehensive Cancer Center Network (NCCN), and St. Gallen] to decide on chemotherapy use. METHODS: Information on overall and metastasis-free survival came from Austrian Breast & Colorectal Cancer Study Group clinical trials 6/8 (n = 1,619) and published literature. Effectiveness was assessed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs (2010) were assessed from a German third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: Lifetime costs per patient ranged from <euro>28,268 (St.Gallen and EPclin) to <euro>33,756 (NCCN).

12743,Cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in German patients with atrial fibrillation,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of the novel fixed-dose anticoagulant rivaroxaban compared with the current standard of care, warfarin, for the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to model the costs and health outcomes of both treatments, potential adverse events, and resulting health states over 35 years. Analyses were based on a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old patients with non-valvular AF at moderate to high risk of stroke. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over the lifetime, and was assessed from the German Statutory Health Insurance (SHI) perspective. Costs and utility data were drawn from public data and the literature, while event probabilities were derived from both the literature and rivaroxaban's pivotal ROCKET AF trial. RESULTS: Stroke prophylaxis with rivaroxaban offers health improvements over warfarin treatment at additional cost. From the SHI perspective, at baseline the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of rivaroxaban was <euro>15,207 per QALY gained in 2014. The results were robust to changes in the majority of variables; however, they were sensitive to the price of rivaroxaban, the hazard ratios for stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, the time horizon, and the discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the substantially higher medication costs of rivaroxaban were offset by mitigating the shortcomings of warfarin, most notably frequent dose regulation and bleeding risk. Future health economic studies on novel oral anticoagulants should evaluate the cost effectiveness for secondary stroke prevention and, as clinical data from direct head-to-head comparisons become available, new anticoagulation therapies should be compared against each other.",2014-01-15543,25404426,Pharmacoeconomics,Alexander Mensch,2015,33 / 3,,Yes,25404426,"Alexander Mensch; Stephanie Stock; Bjorn Stollenwerk; Dirk Muller; Cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in German patients with atrial fibrillation, Pharmacoeconomics, 2015 Mar; 33(3):1179-2027",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fixed-dose anticoagulant rivaroxaban vs. Warfarin,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,15207,Euro,2014,22105.79

The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of starting basal insulin treatment with insulin detemir in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled on oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs) in Mexico, South Korea, India, Indonesia, and Algeria. METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and cost outcomes over a 30-year time horizon. Clinical outcomes, baseline characteristics and health state utility data were taken from the A1chieve study. A 1-year analysis was also conducted based on treatment costs and quality-of-life data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as a fraction of GDP per capita, and WHO-CHOICE recommendations (ICER < 3.0) used to define cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Starting insulin detemir was associated with a projected increase in life expectancy (>/=1 year) and was considered cost-effective in all of the studied populations with ICERs of -0.02 (Mexico), 0.00 (South Korea), 0.48 (India), 0.12 (Indonesia), and 0.88 (Algeria) GDP/quality-adjusted life-year.

12747,An analysis of the cost-effectiveness of starting insulin detemir in insulin-naive people with type 2 diabetes,"AIMS: There is limited evidence with respect to the cost-effectiveness of starting insulin in people with diabetes outside the 'western' world. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of starting basal insulin treatment with insulin detemir in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) inadequately controlled on oral glucose-lowering drugs (OGLDs) in Mexico, South Korea, India, Indonesia, and Algeria. METHODS: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and cost outcomes over a 30-year time horizon. Clinical outcomes, baseline characteristics and health state utility data were taken from the A1chieve study. A 1-year analysis was also conducted based on treatment costs and quality-of-life data. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as a fraction of GDP per capita, and WHO-CHOICE recommendations (ICER < 3.0) used to define cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Starting insulin detemir was associated with a projected increase in life expectancy (>/=1 year) and was considered cost-effective in all of the studied populations with ICERs of -0.02 (Mexico), 0.00 (South Korea), 0.48 (India), 0.12 (Indonesia), and 0.88 (Algeria) GDP/quality-adjusted life-year.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of competing treatment options for patients with medically refractory idiopathic OAB wet was estimated from the perspective of the National Health Service in the UK. We compared sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) with percutaneous nerve evaluation (PNE) or tined-lead evaluation (TLE) with optimal medical therapy (OMT), botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injections, and percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS). We used a Markov model with a 10-year time horizon for all treatment options with the exception of PTNS, which has a time horizon of 5 years.

12755,A cost-utility analysis of a rehabilitation service for people living with and beyond cancer,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a wait-list control randomised trial of an outpatient rehabilitation service for people living with and beyond cancer, delivered in a hospice day care unit. We report the results of an economic evaluation undertaken using the trial data. METHODS: Forty-one participants were recruited into the study. A within-trial stochastic cost-utility analysis was undertaken using Monte-Carlo simulation. The outcome measure for the economic evaluation was quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were measured from the perspective of the NHS and personal social services. Uncertainty in the observed data was captured through probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Scenario analysis was conducted to explore the effects of changing the way QALYs were estimated and adjusting for baseline difference in the population. We also explore assumptions about the length of treatment benefit being maintained. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the base-case analysis was pound14,231 per QALY. When QALYs were assumed to change linearly over time, this increased to pound20,514 per QALY at three months. Adjusting the estimate of QALYs to account for differences in the population at baseline increased the ICER to pound94,748 per QALY at three months. Increasing the assumed length of treatment benefit led to reduced ICERs in all scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Although the intervention is likely to be cost-effective in some circumstances, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the decision to implement the service.

12756,Economic analysis of rivaroxaban for the treatment and long-term prevention of venous thromboembolism in Portugal,"INTRODUCTION: Venous thromboembolism is a burden on healthcare systems. The aim of this analysis was to project the long-term costs and outcomes for rivaroxaban compared to standard of care (enoxaparin/warfarin) in Portugal for the treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed using event rates extracted from the EINSTEIN trials supplemented with literature-based estimates of longer-term outcomes. Core outcomes included per patient costs and quality-adjusted life years reported separately per treatment arm and incrementally, as well as cost per quality-adjusted life years gained. The deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism indications were analysed separately. The analyses were conducted from the Portuguese societal perspective and over a 5-year time horizon. Costs and outcomes were discounted at a 5% annual rate. Several scenario analyses were undertaken to explore the impact on results of varying key modeling assumptions. RESULTS: Rivaroxaban treatment was associated with cost-savings for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis and was both cost-saving and more effective for the treatment of pulmonary embolism, compared with enoxaparin/warfarin. DISCUSSION: The results of the sensitivity and scenario analyses further supported that rivaroxaban is a cost-effective alternative to standard of care treatment. The use of an expert panel to derive some input values and the lack of Portuguese specific utilities were the main limitations.

12758,"Cost-effectiveness of high, moderate and low-dose statins in the prevention of vascular events in the Brazilian public health system","BACKGROUND: Statins have proven efficacy in the reduction of cardiovascular events, but the financial impact of its widespread use can be substantial. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of three statin dosing schemes in the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS) perspective. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of low, intermediate and high intensity dose regimens in secondary and four primary scenarios (5%, 10%, 15% and 20% ten-year risk) of prevention of cardiovascular events. Regimens with expected low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction below 30% (e.g. simvastatin 10mg) were considered as low dose; between 30-40%, (atorvastatin 10mg, simvastatin 40 mg), intermediate dose; and above 40% (atorvastatin 20-80 mg, rosuvastatin 20mg), high-dose statins. Effectiveness data were obtained from a systematic review with 136,000 patients. National data were used to estimate utilities and costs (expressed as International Dollars - Int$). A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold equal to the Brazilian gross domestic product per capita (circa Int$11,770) was applied. RESULTS: Low dose was dominated by extension in the primary prevention scenarios. In the five scenarios, the ICER of intermediate dose was below Int$10,000 per QALY.

Currently few treatments are available. We aimed to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of available treatments for IPF. METHODS: Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness, quality of life and cost effectiveness were undertaken. Eleven bibliographic databases were searched from inception to July 2013 and studies were assessed for eligibility against a set of pre-defined criteria. Two reviewers screened references, extracted data from included studies and appraised their quality. An advisory group was consulted about the choice of interventions. A narrative review was undertaken and where feasible fixed effect and random effects meta-analysis were undertaken including a network meta-analysis (NMA). A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of pharmacological treatments for IPF. Following best practice recommendations, the model perspective was of the national health service and personal social services, a discount rate of 3.5% for costs and health benefits was applied and outcomes were expressed as cost per quality adjusted life-year gained. Parameter values were obtained from the NMA and systematic reviews. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the review of clinical effectiveness, of which one evaluated azathioprine, three N-acetylcysteine [NAC] (alone or in combination), four pirfenidone, one nintedanib, one sildenafil, one thalidomide, two pulmonary rehabilitation, and one a disease management programme. Study quality was generally good. Evidence suggests that some effective treatments are available. In NMA only nintedanib and pirfenidone show statistically significant improvements.

RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in the review of clinical effectiveness, of which one evaluated azathioprine, three N-acetylcysteine [NAC] (alone or in combination), four pirfenidone, one nintedanib, one sildenafil, one thalidomide, two pulmonary rehabilitation, and one a disease management programme. Study quality was generally good. Evidence suggests that some effective treatments are available. In NMA only nintedanib and pirfenidone show statistically significant improvements. The model results show increased survival for five pharmacological treatments (NAC triple therapy, inhaled NAC, nintedanib, pirfenidone, and sildenafil) compared with best supportive care, at increased cost.

METHODS: TIV-unmatched influenza B infection rates with QIV versus TIV were estimated by an epidemiology model. Model parameters included percentages of influenza B lineages in circulation, influenza B-associated hospital admission, age-specific population, vaccine coverage and effectiveness. Incremental cost per QALY gained (ICER) by QIV versus TIV were estimated from Hong Kong's societal perspective.

12775,Economic evaluation of arsenic trioxide for treatment of newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukaemia in Canada,"To assess, from a Canadian perspective, the economic impact of arsenic trioxide (ATO) + all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for treating newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), the cost-effectiveness of ATO + ATRA compared to ATRA + idarubicin (IDA) was assessed over a lifetime horizon using a time-dependent Markov model. The model considers four health states: complete remission, treatment failure or relapse, post-failure, and death. Markov cycle length was 1 month for the first 48 months and 1 year thereafter. Efficacy outcomes in terms of event-free survival and overall survival were taken from a head-to-head clinical trial. Costs were associated with drug and administration, adverse events (AEs), treatment of relapses, follow-up visits, and productivity losses. Utilities and disutilities associated with health states and AEs were derived from the literature. Compared to ATRA + IDA, ATRA + ATO is associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of $CAD50,193/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and $CAD50,338/QALY from a Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH) and societal perspectives, respectively. Results of the one-way sensitivity analysis show that ICER varied from $CAD23,045 to $CAD60,759/QALY (MoH perspective) and from $CAD23,120 to $CAD60,905/QALY (societal perspective). ATO in the first-line therapy for patients with APL can be considered a more cost-effective strategy than standard treatment from a Canadian perspective.

12776,Health economic analysis of human papillomavirus vaccines in women of Chile: perspective of the health care payer using a Markov model,"BACKGROUND: In Chile, significant reductions in cervical cancer incidence and mortality have been observed due to implementation of a well-organized screening program. However, it has been suggested that the inclusion of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for young adolescent women may be the best prospect to further reduce the burden of cervical cancer. This cost-effectiveness study comparing two available HPV vaccines in Chile was performed to support decision making on the implementation of universal HPV vaccination. METHODS: The present analysis used an existing static Markov model to assess the effect of screening and vaccination. This analysis includes the epidemiology of low-risk HPV types allowing for the comparison between the two vaccines (HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine and the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine), latest cross-protection data on HPV vaccines, treatment costs for cervical cancer, vaccine costs and 6% discounting per the health economic guideline for Chile. RESULTS: Projected incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) for the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine was 116 United States (US) dollars per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained or 147 US dollars per life-years (LY) saved, while the projected ICUR/ICER for the HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine was 541 US dollars per QALY gained or 726 US dollars per LY saved. Introduction of any HPV vaccine to the present cervical cancer prevention program of Chile is estimated to be highly cost-effective (below 1X gross domestic product [GDP] per capita, 14278 US dollars). In Chile, the addition of HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine to the existing screening program dominated the addition of HPV-6/11/16/18 vaccine. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis results show that the HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine is expected to be dominant and cost-saving in 69.3% and 77.6% of the replicates respectively.

In 12 scenarios, we explored the impact of different assumptions on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PCV13 over PCV10.Taking only direct effects on invasive pneumococcal disease into account, PCV13 was not found to be cost-effective at a price difference of euro11 per dose. If herd protection, replacement and non-invasive disease were also taken into account, the ICER of PCV13 compared with PCV10 was below euro30 000/QALY gained in 11 of 12 scenarios. PCV13 was considered dominant in the primary scenario with a price difference below euro2.63 per dose.",2014-01-15571,25424791,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Pepijn Vemer,2014,10 / 7,1841-9,No,25424791,"Pepijn Vemer; Maarten J Postma; A few years later.

12781,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination in Indonesia,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A immunization in Indonesia, including an explicit comparison between one-dose and two-dose vaccines. METHODS: An age-structured cohort model based on a decision tree was developed for the 2012 Indonesia birth cohort. Using the model, we made a comparison on the use of two-dose and one-dose vaccines. The model involved a 70-year time horizon with 1-month cycles for children less than 2 years old and annually thereafter. Monte Carlo simulations were used to examine the economic acceptability and affordability of the hepatitis A vaccination. RESULTS: Vaccination would save US$ 3,795,148 and US$ 2,892,920 from the societal perspective, for the two-dose and one-dose vaccine schedules, respectively, in the context of hepatitis A treatment. It also would save 8917 and 6614 discounted quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs), respectively. With the vaccine price of US$ 3.21 per dose, the implementation of single dose vaccine would yield an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 4933 per QALY gained versus no vaccination, whereas the two-dose versus one-dose schedule would cost US$ 14 568 per QALY gained. Considering the 2012 gross-domestic-product (GDP) per capita in Indonesia of US$ 3557, the results indicate that hepatitis A vaccination would be a cost-effective intervention, both for the two-dose and one-dose vaccine schedules in isolation, but two-dose vaccination would no longer be cost-effective if one-dose vaccination is a feasible option. Vaccination would be 100% affordable at budgets of US$ 71,408 000 and US$ 37,690,000 for the implementation of the two-dose and one-dose vaccine schedules, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of hepatitis A vaccination in Indonesia would be a cost-effective health intervention under the market vaccine price. Given the budget limitations, the use of a one-dose-vaccine schedule would be more realistic to be applied than a two-dose schedule. The vaccine price, mortality rate and discount rate were the most influential parameters impacting the ICERs.",2014-01-15573,25424941,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Auliya A Suwantika,2014,10 / 8,2342-9,No,25424941,"Auliya A Suwantika; Philippe Beutels; Maarten J Postma; Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis A vaccination in Indonesia, Hum Vaccin Immunother , ; 10(8):2164-554X; 2342-9",QALY,Indonesia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Population hepatitis A vaccination at 80% coverage rate.

12784,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of acupuncture, counselling and usual care in treating patients with depression: the results of the ACUDep trial","BACKGROUND: New evidence on the clinical effectiveness of acupuncture plus usual care (acupuncture) and counselling plus usual care (counselling) for patients with depression suggests the need to investigate the health-related quality of life and costs of these treatments to understand whether they should be considered a good use of limited health resources. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The cost-effectiveness analyses are based on the Acupuncture, Counselling or Usual care for Depression (ACUDep) trial results. Statistical analyses demonstrate a difference in mean quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and suggest differences in mean costs which are mainly due to the price of the interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis is used to express decision uncertainty. Acupuncture and counselling are found to have higher mean QALYs and costs than usual care. In the base case analysis acupuncture has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound4,560 per additional QALY and is cost-effective with a probability of 0.62 at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20,000 per QALY. Counselling compared with acupuncture is more effective and more costly with an ICER of pound71,757 and a probability of being cost-effective of 0.36. A scenario analysis of counselling versus usual care, excluding acupuncture as a comparator, results in an ICER of pound7,935 and a probability of 0.91. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture is cost-effective compared with counselling or usual care alone, although the ranking of counselling and acupuncture depends on the relative cost of delivering these interventions. For patients in whom acupuncture is unavailable or perhaps inappropriate, counselling has an ICER less than most cost-effectiveness thresholds.

12786,Cost-effectiveness of CT screening in the National Lung Screening Trial,"BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT) as compared with chest radiography reduced lung-cancer mortality. We examined the cost-effectiveness of screening with low-dose CT in the NLST. METHODS: We estimated mean life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs per person, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for three alternative strategies: screening with low-dose CT, screening with radiography, and no screening. Estimations of life-years were based on the number of observed deaths that occurred during the trial and the projected survival of persons who were alive at the end of the trial. Quality adjustments were derived from a subgroup of participants who were selected to complete quality-of-life surveys. Costs were based on utilization rates and Medicare reimbursements. We also performed analyses of subgroups defined according to age, sex, smoking history, and risk of lung cancer and performed sensitivity analyses based on several assumptions. RESULTS: As compared with no screening, screening with low-dose CT cost an additional $1,631 per person (95% confidence interval [CI], 1,557 to 1,709) and provided an additional 0.0316 life-years per person (95% CI, 0.0154 to 0.0478) and 0.0201 QALYs per person (95% CI, 0.0088 to 0.0314). The corresponding ICERs were $52,000 per life-year gained (95% CI, 34,000 to 106,000) and $81,000 per QALY gained (95% CI, 52,000 to 186,000). However, the ICERs varied widely in subgroup and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: We estimated that screening for lung cancer with low-dose CT would cost $81,000 per QALY gained, but we also determined that modest changes in our assumptions would greatly alter this figure. The determination of whether screening outside the trial will be cost-effective will depend on how screening is implemented.

12788,Economic evaluation and budget impact analysis of the surveillance program for hepatocellular carcinoma in Thai chronic hepatitis B patients,"BACKGROUND: The incidence rate and the treatment costs of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are high, especially in Thailand. Previous studies indicated that early detection by a surveillance program could help by down-staging. This study aimed to compare the costs and health outcomes associated with the introduction of a HCC surveillance program with no program and to estimate the budget impact if the HCC surveillance program were implemented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cost utility analysis using a decision tree and Markov models was used to compare costs and outcomes during the lifetime period based on a societal perspective between alternative HCC surveillance strategies with no program. Costs included direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs. Health outcomes were measured as life years (LYs), and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). The results were presented in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in Thai THB per QALY gained. One- way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were applied to investigate parameter uncertainties. Budget impact analysis (BIA) was performed based on the governmental perspective. RESULTS: Semi-annual ultrasonography (US) and semi-annual ultrasonography plus alpha-fetoprotein (US plus AFP) as the first screening for HCC surveillance would be cost-effective options at the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 160,000 THB per QALY gained compared with no surveillance program (ICER=118,796 and ICER=123,451 THB/QALY), respectively. The semi-annual US plus AFP yielded more net monetary benefit, but caused a substantially higher budget (237 to 502 million THB) than semi-annual US (81 to 201 million THB) during the next ten fiscal years.

RESULTS: Semi-annual ultrasonography (US) and semi-annual ultrasonography plus alpha-fetoprotein (US plus AFP) as the first screening for HCC surveillance would be cost-effective options at the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 160,000 THB per QALY gained compared with no surveillance program (ICER=118,796 and ICER=123,451 THB/QALY), respectively. The semi-annual US plus AFP yielded more net monetary benefit, but caused a substantially higher budget (237 to 502 million THB) than semi-annual US (81 to 201 million THB) during the next ten fiscal years. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that a semi-annual US program should be used as the first screening for HCC surveillance and included in the benefit package of Thai health insurance schemes for both chronic hepatitis B males and females aged between 40-50 years. In addition, policy makers considered the program could be feasible, but additional evidence is needed to support the whole prevention system before the implementation of a strategic plan.",2014-01-15588,25374242,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Pannapa Sangmala,2014,15 / 20,8993-9004,No,25374242,"Pannapa Sangmala; Usa Chaikledkaew; Tawesak Tanwandee; Petcharat Pongchareonsuk; Economic evaluation and budget impact analysis of the surveillance program for hepatocellular carcinoma in Thai chronic hepatitis B patients, Asian Pac J Cancer Prev, ; 15(20):1513-7368; 8993-9004",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Semi-annual Ultrasonography plus alpha-fetoprotein vs. None,HBeAg-positive,60 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,123451,Thailand,2013,4473.1
12792,Cost-effectiveness of unicondylar versus total knee arthroplasty: a Markov model analysis,"BACKGROUND: Unicondylar knee arthroplasty (UKA) is believed to lead to less morbidity and enhanced functional outcomes when compared with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Conversely, UKA is also associated with a higher revision risk than TKA. In order to further clarify the key differences between these separate procedures, the current study assessing the cost-effectiveness of UKA versus TKA was undertaken. METHODS: A state-transition Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of UKA versus TKA for unicondylar osteoarthritis using a Belgian payer's perspective. The model was designed to include the possibility of two revision procedures. Model estimates were obtained through literature review and revision rates were based on registry data. Threshold analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess the model's robustness. RESULTS: UKA was associated with a cost reduction of euro2,807 and a utility gain of 0.04 quality-adjusted life years in comparison with TKA. Analysis determined that the model is sensitive to clinical effectiveness, and that a marginal reduction in the clinical performance of UKA would lead to TKA being the more cost-effective solution. CONCLUSION: UKA yields clear advantages in terms of costs and marginal advantages in terms of health effects, in comparison with TKA.",2014-01-15600,25382367,Knee,Geert Peersman,2014,21 Suppl 1 /,S37-42,No,25382367,"Geert Peersman; Wouter Jak; Tom Vandenlangenbergh; Christophe Jans; Philippe Cartier; Peter Fennema; Cost-effectiveness of unicondylar versus total knee arthroplasty: a Markov model analysis, Knee, ; 21 Suppl 1():1873-5800; S37-42",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Unicondylar knee arthroplasty vs. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA),Not Stated,Not Stated,55 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,1.50,-70175,Euro,2014,-102010.52

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of cervical cancer primary screening with a HPV-16/18 genotyping test which simultaneously detects 12 other high-risk HPV types. METHODS: A Markov cohort model compared four strategies: (1) cytology with reflex HPV testing for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US); (2) co-testing with cytology and HPV testing; (3) HPV with reflex to cytology; and (4) HPV with 16/18 genotyping and reflex cytology (ASC-US threshold).

12796,"Cost-effectiveness of supervised exercise, stenting, and optimal medical care for claudication: results from the Claudication: Exercise Versus Endoluminal Revascularization (CLEVER) trial","BACKGROUND: Both supervised exercise (SE) and stenting (ST) improve functional status, symptoms, and quality of life compared with optimal medical care (OMC) in patients with claudication. The relative cost-effectiveness of these strategies is not well defined. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Claudication: Exercise Versus Endoluminal Revascularization (CLEVER) study randomized patients with claudication due to aortoiliac stenosis to a 6-month SE program, to ST, or to OMC. Participants who completed 6-month follow-up (n=98) were included in a health economic analysis through 18 months. Costs were assessed using resource-based methods and hospital billing data. Quality-adjusted life-years were estimated using the EQ-5D. Markov modeling based on the in-trial results was used to explore the impact of assumptions about the longer term durability of observed differences in quality of life. Through 18 months, mean healthcare costs were $5178, $9804, and $14 590 per patient for OMC, SE, and ST, respectively. Measured quality-adjusted life-years through 18 months were 1.04, 1.16, and 1.20. In our base case analysis, which assumed that observed differences in quality of life would dissipate after 5 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $24 070 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for SE versus OMC, $41 376 for ST versus OMC, and $122 600 for ST versus SE. If the treatment effect of ST was assumed to be more durable than that of SE, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ST versus SE became more favorable. CONCLUSIONS: Both SE and ST are economically attractive by US standards relative to OMC for the treatment of claudication in patients with aortoiliac disease. ST is more expensive than SE, with uncertain incremental benefit.

12799,Cost-effectiveness of DTG+ABC/3TC versus EFV/TDF/FTC for first-line treatment of HIV-1 in the United States,"INTRODUCTION: Data from the SINGLE trial demonstrated that 88% of treatment-naive HIV-1 patients treated with dolutegravir and abacavir/lamivudine (DTG+ABC/3TC) achieved viral suppression at 48 weeks compared with 81% of patients treated with efavirenz/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine (EFV/TDF/FTC). It is unclear how this difference in short-term efficacy impacts long-term cost-effectiveness of these regimens. This study sought to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of DTG+ABC/3TC versus EFV/TDF/FTC from a US payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An individual discrete-event simulation model tracked the disease status and treatment pathway of HIV-1 patients. The model simulated treatment over a lifetime horizon by tracking change in patients' CD4 count, occurrence of clinical events (opportunistic infections, cancer and cardiovascular events), treatment switch and death. The model included up to four lines of treatment. Baseline patient characteristics, efficacy and safety of DTG+ABC/3TC and EFV/TDF/FTC were informed by data from the SINGLE trial. The efficacy of subsequent lines of treatment, clinical event risks, mortality, cost and utility inputs were based on literature and expert opinion. Outcomes were lifetime medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (both discounted at 3% per annum) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Compared with EFV/TDF/FTC, DTG+ABC/3TC increased lifetime costs by $58,188 and per-person survival by 0.12 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $482,717/QALY. In sensitivity analyses testing conservative assumptions about EFV/TDF/FTC's efficacy beyond the trial period, ICERs comparing DTG+ABC/3TC to EFV/TDF/FTC remained high (lowest reported ICER of $365,662/QALY). In a scenario in which the price of EFV/TDF/FTC was reduced by 10% to reflect the potential for price reduction as EFV goes off patent, DTG+ABC/3TC's ICER compared to EFV/TDF/FTC was $600,916/QALY. When DTG+ABC/3TC's price was reduced by 10%, the resulting ICER comparing DTG+ABC/3TC to EFV/TDF/FTC was $302,171/QALY.
