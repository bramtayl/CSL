25001,Cost-utility analysis of cardiovascular outpatient rehabilitation care and spa treatment care for patients with heart disease,"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases have the highest mortality rates and the costs for treatment are very high so far. Cardiovascular rehabilitation helps to reduce the risk of relapses or deterioration of cardiovascular diseases, however, the number of patients that participate is insufficient, especially in later stages of the rehabilitation process. The aim of the study is to evaluate cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular rehabilitation care using cost-utility analysis. METHODS: The study evaluate the Cardio ambulance Late Phase, Late Phase of The Spa treatment and for comparison also Early Phase of The Spa treatment in Konstantin Spa. The research was conducted in outpatient facility and spa facility. For QALY, a prospective questionnaire survey was conducted in patients with cardiovascular disease using generic EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. The costs were calculated from the perspective of the health care payer. The cost-utility analysis was carried out at the end of the study and results are presented in incremental cost-utility ratio. RESULTS: The average cost per patient in outpatient facility is CZK 12,459. The average amount for an overall early phase of spa treatment per patient is CZK 35,161. The average amount for an overall late phase spa treatment per patient is CZK 30,503. QALY obtained from Index Value was 0.092 (Konstantin Spa Early Phase), 0.054 (Konstantin Spa Late Phase), 0.26 (Cardio ambulance Late Phase). For Konstantin Spa Late Phase, the ICUR value was 644,436 and for Konstantin Spa Early Phase was 343,981 (comparator is the Cardio ambulance Late Phase). Konstantin Spa Early Phase compared to Konstantin Spa Late Phase had an ICUR value of 122,592. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the spa treatment in later stage of the cardiovascular rehabilitation process is cost effective with use of cost effectiveness threshold three times the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita.",2020-01-34951,33013203,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Ondrej Gajdoš,2020,18 /,39,Yes,33013203,"Ondrej Gajdoš; Vojtech Kamenský; Kristýna Doskocilová; Martina Caithamlová; Ivana Kubátová; Cost-utility analysis of cardiovascular outpatient rehabilitation care and spa treatment care for patients with heart disease, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2020; 18():1478-7547; 39",QALY,Czech Republic,Not Stated,Care Delivery,"konstantin spa early phase vs. konstantin spa late phase (non acute patients, comprehensive treatment for 28 days)",prague,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,122592.37,Czech Republic,2015,5442.95
25002,Reduction of routine use of radiography in patients with ankle fractures leads to lower costs and has no impact on clinical outcome: an economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a reduction in the number of routine radiographs in the follow-up of patients with ankle fractures. METHODS: We performed an economic evaluation alongside the multicentre, randomised WARRIOR trial. Participants were randomised to a reduced imaging follow-up protocol (i.e. radiographs at week 6 and 12 follow-up obtained on clinical indication) or usual care (i.e. routine radiography at weeks 6 and 12). The Olerud & Molander Ankle Score (OMAS) was used to assess ankle function and the EQ-5D-3L was used to estimate Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Costs and resource use were assessed using self-reported questionnaires and medical records, and analysed from a societal perspective. Multiple imputation was used for missing data, and data were analysed using seemingly unrelated regression analysis and bootstrapping. RESULTS: In total, 246 patients had data available for analysis (reduced imaging?=?118; usual care?=?128). Fewer radiographs were obtained in the reduced imaging group (median?=?4) compared with the usual-care group (median?=?5). Functional outcome was comparable in both groups. The difference in QALYs was -?0.008 (95% CI:-0.06 to 0.04) and the difference in OMAS was 0.73 (95% CI:-5.29 to 6.76). Imaging costs were lower in the reduced imaging group (-€48; 95% CI:- €72 to -€25). All other cost categories did not statistically differ between the groups. The probability of the reduced imaging protocol being cost-effectiveness was 0.45 at a wiliness-to-pay of €20,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing the number of routine follow-up radiographs has a low probability of being cost-effective compared with usual care. Functional outcome, health-related quality of life and societal costs were comparable in both groups, whereas imaging costs were marginally lower in the reduced imaging group. Given this, adherence to a reduced imaging follow-up protocol for those with routine ankle fractures can be followed without sacrificing quality of care, and may result in reduced costs.

METHODS: We developed a Markov model of the HPV disease course and evaluated the clinical and economic value of HPV primary screening with Onclarity capable of extended genotyping in a cohort of women =30 years old. Women with certain genotypes were later rescreened instead of undergoing immediate colposcopy and varied which genotypes were rescreened, disease progression rate, and test cost. RESULTS: Assuming 100% compliance with screening, HPV primary screening using current tests resulted in 25,194 invasive procedures and 48 invasive cervical cancer (ICC) cases per 100,000 women. Screening with extended genotyping (100% compliance) and later rescreening women with certain genotypes averted 903-3,163 invasive procedures and resulted in 0-3 more ICC cases compared to current HPV primary screening tests.

25009,Type 2 diabetes remission: 2 year within-trial and lifetime-horizon cost-effectiveness of the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT)/Counterweight-Plus weight management programme,"AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Approximately 10% of total healthcare budgets worldwide are spent on treating diabetes and its complications, and budgets are increasing globally because of ageing populations and more expensive second-line medications. The aims of the study were to estimate the within-trial and lifetime cost-effectiveness of the weight management programme, which achieved 46% remissions of type 2 diabetes at year 1 and 36% at year 2 in the Diabetes Remission Clinical Trial (DiRECT). METHODS: Within-trial analysis assessed costs of the Counterweight-Plus intervention in DiRECT (including training, programme materials, practitioner appointments and low-energy diet), along with glucose-lowering and antihypertensive medications, and all routine healthcare contacts. Lifetime cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was estimated according to projected durations of remissions, assuming continued relapse rates as seen in year 2 of DiRECT and consequent life expectancy, quality of life and healthcare costs. RESULTS: Mean total 2 year healthcare costs for the intervention and control groups were £3036 and £2420, respectively: an incremental cost of £616 (95% CI -£45, £1269). Intervention costs (£1411; 95% CI £1308, £1511) were partially offset by lower other healthcare costs (£796; 95% CI £150, £1465), including reduced oral glucose-lowering medications by £231 (95% CI £148, £314). Net remission at 2 years was 32.3% (95% CI 23.5%, 40.3%), and cost per remission achieved was £1907 (lower 95% CI: intervention dominates; upper 95% CI: £4212). Over a lifetime horizon, the intervention was modelled to achieve a mean 0.06 (95% CI 0.04, 0.09) QALY gain for the DiRECT population and mean total lifetime cost savings per participant of £1337 (95% CI £674, £2081), with the intervention becoming cost-saving within 6 years. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Incorporating the lifetime healthcare cost savings due to periods of remission from diabetes and its complications, the DiRECT intervention is predicted to be both more effective (QALY gain) and cost-saving in adults with type 2 diabetes compared with standard care. This conclusion appears robust to various less favourable model scenarios, providing strong evidence that resources could be shifted cost-effectively to support achieving remissions with the DiRECT intervention.

25010,Cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening with primary HPV testing for unvaccinated women in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Sweden revised their cervical cancer screening program in 2017 to include cytology-based screening for women aged 23-29 years and primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for women aged 30-64 years; however, alternative strategies may be preferred. To inform cervical cancer prevention policies for unvaccinated women, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies, including the current Swedish guidelines. METHODS: We adapted a mathematical simulation model of HPV and cervical cancer to the Swedish context using primary epidemiologic data. We compared the cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies that varied by the age to start screening, the age to switch from cytology to HPV testing, HPV strategies not preceded by cytology, screening frequency, and management of HPV-positive/cytology-negative women. RESULTS: We found that the current Swedish guidelines were more costly and less effective than alternative primary HPV-based strategies. All cost-efficient strategies involved primary HPV testing not preceded by cytology for younger women. Given a cost-effectiveness threshold of €85,619 per quality-adjusted life year gained, the optimal strategy involved 5-yearly primary HPV-based screening for women aged 23-50 years and 10-yearly HPV-based screening for women older than age 50 years.

We compared the cost-effectiveness of alternative screening strategies that varied by the age to start screening, the age to switch from cytology to HPV testing, HPV strategies not preceded by cytology, screening frequency, and management of HPV-positive/cytology-negative women. RESULTS: We found that the current Swedish guidelines were more costly and less effective than alternative primary HPV-based strategies. All cost-efficient strategies involved primary HPV testing not preceded by cytology for younger women. Given a cost-effectiveness threshold of €85,619 per quality-adjusted life year gained, the optimal strategy involved 5-yearly primary HPV-based screening for women aged 23-50 years and 10-yearly HPV-based screening for women older than age 50 years.

25023,Health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of diversion programs for low-level drug offenders: A model-based analysis,"BACKGROUND: Cycles of incarceration, drug abuse, and poverty undermine ongoing public health efforts to reduce overdose deaths and the spread of infectious disease in vulnerable populations. Jail diversion programs aim to divert low-level drug offenders toward community care resources, avoiding criminal justice costs and disruptions in treatment for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and drug abuse. We sought to assess the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of a jail diversion program for low-level drug offenders. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a microsimulation model, calibrated to King County, Washington, that captured the spread of HIV and HCV infections and incarceration and treatment systems as well as preexisting interventions such as needle and syringe programs and opiate agonist therapy. We considered an adult population of people who inject drugs (PWID), people who use drugs but do not inject (PWUD), men who have sex with men, and lower-risk heterosexuals. We projected discounted lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 10-year time horizon with and without a jail diversion program and calculated resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the health system and societal perspectives. We also tracked HIV and HCV infections, overdose deaths, and jail population size. Over 10 years, the program was estimated to reduce HIV and HCV incidence by 3.4% (95% CI 2.7%-4.0%) and 3.3% (95% CI 3.1%-3.4%), respectively, overdose deaths among PWID by 10.0% (95% CI 9.8%-10.8%), and jail population size by 6.3% (95% CI 5.9%-6.7%). When considering healthcare costs only, the program cost $25,500/QALY gained (95% CI $12,600-$48,600). Including savings from reduced incarceration (societal perspective) improved the ICER to $6,200/QALY gained (95% CI, cost-saving $24,300). Sensitivity analysis indicated that cost-effectiveness depends on diversion program participants accessing community programs such as needle and syringe programs, treatment for substance use disorder, and HIV and HCV treatment, as well as diversion program cost. A limitation of the analysis is data availability, as fewer data are available for diversion programs than for more established interventions aimed at people with substance use disorder. Additionally, like any model of a complex system, our model relies on simplifying assumptions: For example, we simplified pathways in the healthcare and criminal justice systems, modeled an average efficacy for substance use disorder treatment, and did not include costs associated with homelessness, unemployment, and breakdown in family structure. CONCLUSIONS: We found that diversion programs for low-level drug offenders are likely to be cost-effective, generating savings in the criminal justice system while only moderately increasing healthcare costs. Such programs can reduce incarceration and its associated costs, and also avert overdose deaths and improve quality of life for PWID, PWUD, and the broader population (through reduced HIV and HCV transmission).",2020-01-35006,33048929,PLoS Med,Cora L Bernard,2020,17 / 10,e1003239,No,33048929,"Cora L Bernard; Isabelle J Rao; Konner K Robison; Margaret L Brandeau; Health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of diversion programs for low-level drug offenders: A model-based analysis, PLoS Med, 2020 Oct; 17(10):1549-1676; e1003239",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Care Delivery,diversion program with connection to community programs (healthcare perspective) vs. Standard/Usual Care- status quo,"king county, washington, people who inject drugs, people who use drugs but do not inject, men who have sex with men, and lower-risk heterosexuals",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,2000,United States,2016,2156.7

We sought to assess the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of a jail diversion program for low-level drug offenders. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a microsimulation model, calibrated to King County, Washington, that captured the spread of HIV and HCV infections and incarceration and treatment systems as well as preexisting interventions such as needle and syringe programs and opiate agonist therapy. We considered an adult population of people who inject drugs (PWID), people who use drugs but do not inject (PWUD), men who have sex with men, and lower-risk heterosexuals. We projected discounted lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 10-year time horizon with and without a jail diversion program and calculated resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) from the health system and societal perspectives. We also tracked HIV and HCV infections, overdose deaths, and jail population size. Over 10 years, the program was estimated to reduce HIV and HCV incidence by 3.4% (95% CI 2.7%-4.0%) and 3.3% (95% CI 3.1%-3.4%), respectively, overdose deaths among PWID by 10.0% (95% CI 9.8%-10.8%), and jail population size by 6.3% (95% CI 5.9%-6.7%). When considering healthcare costs only, the program cost $25,500/QALY gained (95% CI $12,600-$48,600). Including savings from reduced incarceration (societal perspective) improved the ICER to $6,200/QALY gained (95% CI, cost-saving $24,300). Sensitivity analysis indicated that cost-effectiveness depends on diversion program participants accessing community programs such as needle and syringe programs, treatment for substance use disorder, and HIV and HCV treatment, as well as diversion program cost. A limitation of the analysis is data availability, as fewer data are available for diversion programs than for more established interventions aimed at people with substance use disorder. Additionally, like any model of a complex system, our model relies on simplifying assumptions: For example, we simplified pathways in the healthcare and criminal justice systems, modeled an average efficacy for substance use disorder treatment, and did not include costs associated with homelessness, unemployment, and breakdown in family structure. CONCLUSIONS: We found that diversion programs for low-level drug offenders are likely to be cost-effective, generating savings in the criminal justice system while only moderately increasing healthcare costs. Such programs can reduce incarceration and its associated costs, and also avert overdose deaths and improve quality of life for PWID, PWUD, and the broader population (through reduced HIV and HCV transmission).",2020-01-35006,33048929,PLoS Med,Cora L Bernard,2020,17 / 10,e1003239,No,33048929,"Cora L Bernard; Isabelle J Rao; Konner K Robison; Margaret L Brandeau; Health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of diversion programs for low-level drug offenders: A model-based analysis, PLoS Med, 2020 Oct; 17(10):1549-1676; e1003239",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Care Delivery,diversion program with connection to community programs (societal perspective) vs. Standard/Usual Care- status quo,"king county, washington, people who inject drugs, people who use drugs but do not inject, men who have sex with men, and lower-risk heterosexuals",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,1000,United States,2016,1078.35
25025,Methotrexate (MTX) Plus Hydroxychloroquine versus MTX Plus Leflunomide in Patients with MTX-Resistant Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: A 2-Year Cohort Study in Real World,"PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of methotrexate (MTX) plus hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) vs MTX plus leflunomide (LEF) in established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with inadequate response to MTX monotherapy in a real-world Chinese cohort. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective RA cohort (n=549) was screened with eligible patients who had inadequate response (disease activity score in 28 joints using erythrocyte sedimentation rate, DAS28-ESR>3.2) to initial MTX monotherapy and subsequently received either MTX+HCQ or MTX+LEF. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to adjust the possible baseline confounders between two groups. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving first remission (DAS28-ESR<2.6) during follow-up by log rank test. Secondary outcomes were changes of DAS28, glucocorticoids (GCs) exposure, safety, cost-effectiveness, sustained remission, and low disease activity (LDA) rate after 24-month follow-up. RESULTS: Overall, 222 eligible patients were subjected to the aforementioned two treatment protocols (MTX+HCQ, n=102; MTX+LEF, n=120). After PSM adjustment, 97 patients in each group were analyzed. A higher remission rate was observed in the MTX+HCQ group than in the MTX+LEF group (70.1% vs 56.7%, P=0.048). The median time to remission was 11 and 16 months in the two groups, respectively. At the endpoint, more patients achieved remission (46.8% vs 32.5%, P=0.063) and maintained sustained LDA in the HCQ group (53.2% vs 38.6%, P=0.062) and also more patients withdrew GCs in this group (32% vs 16.7%, P=0.053) than those in the LEF group. Safety profiles were non-alarming, with no significant difference between the two groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio yielded by MTX+HCQ over MTX+LEF was $1,111.8 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), within the cost-effective threshold set as the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of China. CONCLUSION: The MTX+HCQ combination was seemingly superior to MTX+LEF in a real-world cohort of Chinese RA patients with inadequate response to methotrexate monotherapy in respect of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness.",2020-01-35012,33376379,J Inflamm Res,Le Zhang,2020,13 /,1141-1150,No,33376379,"Le Zhang; Fangfang Chen; Shikai Geng; Xiaodong Wang; Liyang Gu; Yitian Lang; Ting Li; Shuang Ye; Methotrexate (MTX) Plus Hydroxychloroquine versus MTX Plus Leflunomide in Patients with MTX-Resistant Active Rheumatoid Arthritis: A 2-Year Cohort Study in Real World, J Inflamm Res, 2020; 13():1178-7031; 1141-1150",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,methotrexate + hydroxychloroquine vs. 10 mg methotrexate weekly + 200 mg leflunomide daily,"inadequate response to initial methotrexate monotherapy, fulfilled 2010 criteria for rheumatoid arthritis of the American College of Rheumatology or European League Against Rheumatism",85 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,1111.8,United States,2019,1125.52

We assessed the impact on survival and the cost-effectiveness of implementing an MTB in Mozambique, sub-Saharan Africa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective cohort study included 205 patients with breast cancer diagnosed between January 2015 and August 2017 (98 before and 107 after MTB implementation), followed to November 2019. Pre- and post-MTB implementation subcohorts were compared for clinical characteristics, treatments, and overall survival. We used hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI), computed by Cox proportional hazards regression. The impact of MTB implementation on the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was estimated from the provider perspective. RESULTS: We found no significant differences between pre- and post-MTB subcohorts regarding clinical characteristics or treatments received. Among patients with early breast cancer (stage 0-III; n =?163), the 3-year overall survival was 48.0% (95% CI, 35.9-59.1) in the pre-MTB and 73.0% (95% CI, 61.3-81.6) in the post-MTB subcohort; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.47 (95% CI, 0.27-0.81). The absolute 3-year mean cost increase was $119.83 per patient, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $802.96 per QALY, corresponding to 1.6 times the gross domestic product of Mozambique. CONCLUSION: The implementation of a MTB in Mozambique led to a 53% mortality decrease among patients with early breast cancer, and it was cost-effective. These findings highlight the feasibility of implementing this strategy and the need for scaling-up MTBs in developing countries, as a way to improve patient outcomes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Currently, more than half of the deaths from breast cancer in the world occur in developing countries. Strategies that optimize care and that are adjusted for available resources are needed to improve the outcomes of patients with breast cancer in these regions. The discussion of cases at multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs) may improve survival outcomes, but implementation is suboptimal worldwide, and evidence regarding their effectiveness in developing countries is lacking. This study evaluated the impact of implementing an MTB on the care and survival of patients with breast cancer in Mozambique, sub-Saharan Africa and its cost-effectiveness in this low-income setting.",2020-01-35025,33325595,Oncologist,Mariana Brandão,2020,/,,No,33325595,"Mariana Brandão; Assucena Guisseve; Genoveva Bata; João Firmino-Machado; Matos Alberto; Josefo Ferro; Carlos Garcia; Clésio Zaqueu; Astrilde Jamisse; Cesaltina Lorenzoni; Martine Piccart-Gebhart; Dina Leitão; Jotamo Come; Otília Soares; Alberto Gudo-Morais; Fernando Schmitt; Satish Tulsidás; Carla Carrilho; Nuno Lunet; Survival Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of a Multidisciplinary Tumor Board for Breast Cancer in Mozambique, Sub-Saharan Africa, Oncologist, 2020 Dec 16; ():1083-7159",QALY,Mozambique,Not Stated,Care Delivery,multidisciplinary tumor board vs. Standard/Usual Care- usual care without multidisciplinary tumor board,"newly diagnosed, maputo central hospital",Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,802.96,Mozambique,2019,13.02
25027,Cost-Effectiveness of Neonatal Hearing Screening Programs: A Micro-Simulation Modeling Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Early detection of neonatal hearing impairment moderates the negative effects on speech and language development. Universal neonatal hearing screening protocols vary in tests used, timing of testing and the number of stages of screening. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of various protocols in the preparation of implementation of neonatal hearing screening in Albania. DESIGN: A micro-simulation model was developed using input on demography, natural history of neonatal hearing impairment, screening characteristics and treatment. Parameter values were derived from a review of the literature and expert opinion. We simulated multiple protocols using otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and automated auditory brainstem response (aABR), varying the test type, timing and number of stages. Cost-effectiveness was analyzed over a life-time horizon. RESULTS: The two best protocols for well infants were OAE followed by aABR (i.e., two-stage OAE-aABR) testing in the maternity ward and single-aABR testing. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were €4181 and €78,077 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. Single-aABR screening led to more cases being detected compared to a two-stage screening program. However, it also resulted in higher referral rates, which increased the total costs of diagnostics. Multi-staged screening decreased referral rates but may increase the number of missed cases due to false-negative test results and nonattendance. CONCLUSIONS: Only the 2-stage OAE-aABR (maternity ward) protocol was below the willingness-to-pay threshold of €10,413 for Albania, as suggested by the World Health Organization, and was found to be cost-effective.

25033,College Campuses and COVID-19 Mitigation: Clinical and Economic Value,"BACKGROUND: Colleges in the United States are determining how to operate safely amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical outcomes, cost, and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation strategies on college campuses. DESIGN: The Clinical and Economic Analysis of COVID-19 interventions (CEACOV) model, a dynamic microsimulation model, was used to examine alternative mitigation strategies. The CEACOV model tracks infections accrued by students and faculty, accounting for community transmissions. DATA SOURCES: Data from published literature were used to obtain parameters related to COVID-19 and contact-hours. TARGET POPULATION: Undergraduate students and faculty at U.S. colleges. TIME HORIZON: One semester (105 days). PERSPECTIVE: Modified societal. INTERVENTION: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including social distancing, masks, and routine laboratory screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Infections among students and faculty per 5000 students and per 1000 faculty, isolation days, tests, costs, cost per infection prevented, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Among students, mitigation strategies reduced COVID-19 cases from 3746 with no mitigation to 493 with extensive social distancing and masks, and further to 151 when laboratory testing was added among asymptomatic persons every 3 days. Among faculty, these values were 164, 28, and 25 cases, respectively. Costs ranged from about $0.4 million for minimal social distancing to about $0.9 million to $2.1 million for strategies involving laboratory testing ($10 per test), depending on testing frequency. Extensive social distancing with masks cost $170 per infection prevented ($49 200 per QALY) compared with masks alone. Adding routine laboratory testing increased cost per infection prevented to between $2010 and $17 210 (cost per QALY gained, $811 400 to $2 804 600). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were most sensitive to test costs. LIMITATION: Data are from multiple sources. CONCLUSION: Extensive social distancing with a mandatory mask-wearing policy can prevent most COVID-19 cases on college campuses and is very cost-effective. Routine laboratory testing would prevent 96% of infections and require low-cost tests to be economically attractive.

Extensive social distancing with masks cost $170 per infection prevented ($49 200 per QALY) compared with masks alone. Adding routine laboratory testing increased cost per infection prevented to between $2010 and $17 210 (cost per QALY gained, $811 400 to $2 804 600).

CONCLUSION: Extensive social distancing with a mandatory mask-wearing policy can prevent most COVID-19 cases on college campuses and is very cost-effective. Routine laboratory testing would prevent 96% of infections and require low-cost tests to be economically attractive.

25038,Is cycle network expansion cost-effective? A health economic evaluation of cycling in Oslo,"BACKGROUND: Expansion of designated cycling networks increases cycling for transport that, in turn, increases physical activity, contributing to improvement in public health. This paper aims to determine whether cycle-network construction in a large city is cost-effective when compared to the status-quo. We developed a cycle-network investment model (CIM) for Oslo and explored its impact on overall health and wellbeing resulting from the increased physical activity. METHODS: First, we applied a regression technique on cycling data from 123 major European cities to model the effect of additional cycle-networks on the share of cyclists. Second, we used a Markov model to capture health benefits from increased cycling for people starting to ride cycle at the age of 30 over the next 25?years. All health gains were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were estimated in US dollars. Other data to populate the model were derived from a comprehensive literature search of epidemiological and economic evaluation studies. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Our regression analysis reveals that a 100?km new cycle network construction in Oslo city would increase cycling share by 3%. Under the base-case assumptions, where the benefits of the cycle-network investment relating to increased physical activity are sustained over 25?years, the predicted average increases in costs and QALYs per person are $416 and 0.019, respectively. Thus, the incremental costs are $22,350 per QALY gained. This is considered highly cost-effective in a Norwegian setting. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the use of CIM as part of a public health program to improve physical activity and consequently avert morbidity and mortality. CIM is affordable and has a long-term effect on physical activity that in turn has a positive impact on health improvement.",2020-01-35055,33287754,BMC Public Health,Admassu N Lamu,2020,20 / 1,1869,No,33287754,"Admassu N Lamu; Abdulrahman Jbaily; Stéphane Verguet; Bjarne Robberstad; Ole Frithjof Norheim; Is cycle network expansion cost-effective?

25039,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT to Guide Management of Small Renal Masses,"BACKGROUND: Incidentally detected small renal masses (SRMs) may be one of several benign or malignant tumor histologies, and are heterogeneous in oncologic potential. Renal mass biopsy can be used to determine the histology of SRMs. However, this invasive approach has significant limitations. Technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography ((99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT) is a promising imaging tool that can aid in identifying benign renal oncocytomas and hybrid oncocytic/chromophobe tumors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and economic value of (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT in guiding the management of SRMs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We developed a decision analysis model to estimate the costs and health outcomes of competing management strategies for a healthy 65-yr-old patient with an asymptomatic SRM. INTERVENTION: Empiric surgery (reference); real-world clinical practice (RWCP) consisting of empiric surgery, thermal ablation, and active surveillance (alternative reference); renal mass biopsy (option 1); (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT (option 2); and (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT followed by biopsy to confirm benign SRMs (option 3). OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We assessed lifetime health utilities, measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and direct medical costs from a health payer perspective. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for options 1-3 versus the reference and alternative reference arms, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY. Univariate, multivariate, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Option 3 had a very low risk of untreated malignant tumors (0.2%, vs 2.1% for option 1, 4.2% for option 2, and 0% for empiric surgery) and the highest probability of leaving benign tumors untreated (84.4%, vs 53.9% for option 1, 51.7% for option 2, and 0% for empiric surgery). Option 3 dominated empiric surgery and options 1 and 2 (ie, lower costs and higher QALYs). Compared with RWCP, options 1-3 were all cost effective; option 3 had the lowest ICER of $18 821/QALY. These findings were robust to alternative input values. Study limitations included data uncertainties and a limited number of centers from which (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT performance data were collected. CONCLUSIONS: (99m)Tc-sestamibi SPECT/CT followed by confirmatory biopsy helps avoid surgery for benign SRMs, minimizes untreated malignant SRMs, and is cost effective compared with existing strategies. PATIENT SUMMARY: Our research suggests that by using a noninvasive imaging test, known as technetium-99m sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography, to diagnose small renal masses, urologists may avoid unnecessary surgery for benign tumors and minimize the risk of leaving a malignant tumor untreated.

Costs were evaluated in relation to health impact, taking a societal perspective. METHODS: Cost analysis was based on data from an open randomized controlled trial in an ERAS setting at a Swedish tertiary referral university hospital: 50 women with low-risk endometrial cancer scheduled for surgery between February 2012 and May 2016 were included; 25 women were allocated to robotic and 25 to abdominal hysterectomy. We compared the total time in the operating theater, procedure costs, post-operative care, length of hospital stay, readmissions, informal care, and sick leave as well as the health-related quality of life until 6?weeks after surgery. The comparison was made by using the EuroQoL group form with five dimensions and three levels (EQ-5D). The primary outcome measure was total cost; secondary outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost per QALY. The costs were calculated in Swedish Krona (SEK). RESULTS: Age (median (IQR) 68 (63-72) vs 67 (59-75) years), duration of hospital stay (ie, time to discharge criteria were met) (median (IQR) 36 (36-36) vs 36 (36-54) hours), and sick leave (median (IQR) 25 (17-30) vs 31 (36-54) days) did not differ between the robotic and abdominal group. Time of surgery was significantly longer in the robotic group than in the abdominal group (median (IQR) 70 (60-90) vs 56 (49-84) min; p<0.05). The robotic group recovered significantly faster as measured by the EQ-5D health index and gained 0.018 QALYs until 6?weeks after surgery. Total costs were 20% higher for the robotic procedure (SEK71 634 vs SEK59 319). The total cost per QALY gained for women in the robotic group was slightly under SEK700 000. CONCLUSIONS: Robotic hysterectomy used in an ERAS setting in the treatment of early endometrial cancer improved health within 6?weeks after the operation at a high cost for the health gained compared with abdominal hysterectomy.

The productivity loss and informal care were lower for robotic hysterectomy, while healthcare had a higher procedure cost that could not be offset by the higher cost due to complications in the abdominal group.",2020-01-35062,32863275,Int J Gynecol Cancer,Evelyn Serreyn Lundin,2020,30 / 11,1719-1725,No,32863275,"Evelyn Serreyn Lundin; Per Carlsson; Ninnie Borendal Wodlin; Lena Nilsson; Preben Kjölhede; Cost-effectiveness of robotic hysterectomy versus abdominal hysterectomy in early endometrial cancer, Int J Gynecol Cancer, 2020 Nov; 30(11):1048-891X; 1719-1725",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Medical Procedure, Surgical",robotic hysterectomy (500 procedures annually) vs. Standard/Usual Care- abdominal hysterectomy (500 procedures annually),"low risk; Linköping, Sweden",Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,6 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,469778,Sweden,2018,55689.57
25044,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Smoking-Cessation Interventions Prior to Posterolateral Lumbar Fusion,"BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation represents an opportunity to reduce both short and long-term effects of smoking on complications after lumbar fusion and smoking-related morbidity and mortality. However, the cost-effectiveness of smoking-cessation interventions prior to lumbar fusion is not fully known. METHODS: We created a decision-analytic Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 5 smoking-cessation strategies (behavioral counseling, nicotine replacement therapy [NRT], bupropion or varenicline monotherapy, and a combined intervention) prior to single-level, instrumented lumbar posterolateral fusion (PLF) from the health payer perspective. Probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from published sources. We calculated the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with each strategy over multiple time horizons and accounted for uncertainty with probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) consisting of 10,000 second-order Monte Carlo simulations. RESULTS: Every smoking-cessation intervention was more effective and less costly than usual care at the lifetime horizon. In the short term, behavioral counseling, NRT, varenicline monotherapy, and the combined intervention were also cost-saving, while bupropion monotherapy was more effective but more costly than usual care. The mean lifetime cost savings for behavioral counseling, NRT, bupropion monotherapy, varenicline monotherapy, and the combined intervention were $3,291 (standard deviation [SD], $868), $2,571 (SD, $479), $2,851 (SD, $830), $6,767 (SD, $1,604), and $34,923 (SD, $4,248), respectively. The minimum efficacy threshold (relative risk for smoking cessation) for lifetime cost savings varied from 1.01 (behavioral counseling) to 1.15 (varenicline monotherapy). A PSA revealed that the combined smoking-cessation intervention was always more effective and less costly than usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Even brief smoking-cessation interventions yield large short-term and long-term cost savings. Smoking-cessation interventions prior to PLF can both reduce costs and improve patient outcomes as health payers/systems shift toward value-based reimbursement (e.g., bundled payments) or population health models.

25049,Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for acute aortic dissection during cardiac arrest: A nationwide retrospective observational study,"AIM: Acute aortic dissection (AAD) has been considered a contraindication for extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR). However, studies are lacking regarding the epidemiology and effectiveness of ECPR for AAD. We aimed to examine whether ECPR for AAD during refractory cardiac arrest is effective. METHODS: Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination inpatient database from July 2010 to March 2018, we identified all emergently hospitalized adults who received ECPR on the day of admission and all AAD patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the day of admission. ECPR was defined as receiving both cardiopulmonary resuscitation and percutaneous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality and neurological outcomes. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ECPR for AAD. RESULTS: We identified 398 AAD patients with ECPR, 9840 non-AAD patients with ECPR, and 9709 AAD patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation but not ECPR. The incidence of AAD among the patients with ECPR on the day of admission was 3.9%. In-hospital mortality was 98% in AAD patients with ECPR, 79% in non-AAD patients with ECPR, and 98% in AAD patients with cardiopulmonary resuscitation but not ECPR. Seven AAD patients survived to discharge after ECPR; of these, six patients had good neurological outcomes at discharge. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ECPR for AAD was estimated at 161,504 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained. CONCLUSION: ECPR successfully improved outcomes and/or facilitated surgery for a small number of AAD patients with refractory cardiac arrest; however, the cost burden of ECPR for AAD patients may be unacceptably high.",2020-01-35092,32800864,Resuscitation,Hiroyuki Ohbe,2020,156 /,237-243,No,32800864,"Hiroyuki Ohbe; Takayuki Ogura; Hiroki Matsui; Hideo Yasunaga; D van Poppelen; V Sisodia; R J de Haan; M G W Dijkgraaf; P R Schuurman; G J Geurtsen; A E M Berk; R M A de Bie; J M Dijk; Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for acute aortic dissection during cardiac arrest: A nationwide retrospective observational study, Resuscitation, 2020 Nov; 156():0300-9572; 237-243",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Procedure",extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation vs. Standard/Usual Care- cardiopulmonary resuscitation,refractory cardiac arrest,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,161504,United States,2018,166458.97
25050,Cost-effectiveness of surveillance with CT colonography after resection of colorectal cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Surveillance following colorectal cancer (CRC) resection uses optical colonoscopy (OC) to detect intraluminal disease and CT to detect extracolonic recurrence. CT colonography (CTC) might be an efficient use of resources in this situation because it allows for intraluminal and extraluminal evaluations with one test. DESIGN: We developed a simulation model to compare lifetime costs and benefits for a cohort of patients with resected CRC. Standard of care involved annual CT for 3 years and OC for years 1, 4 and every 5 years thereafter. For the CTC-based strategy, we replace CT+OC at year 1 with CTC. Patients with lesions greater than 6?mm detected by CTC underwent OC. Detection of an adenoma 10?mm or larger was followed by OC at 1?year, then every 3 years thereafter. Test characteristics and costs for CTC were derived from a clinical study. Medicare costs were used for cancer care costs as well as alternative test costs. We discounted costs and effects at 3% per year. RESULTS: For persons with resected stage III CRC, the standard-of-care strategy was more costly (US$293) and effective (2.6 averted CRC cases and 1.1 averted cancer deaths per 1000) than the CTC-based strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$55?500 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Our analysis was most sensitive to the sensitivity of CTC for detecting polyps 10?mm or larger and assumptions about disease progression.

25054,Evaluation of the Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Once-Weekly Semaglutide Versus Dulaglutide and Sitagliptin in the Spanish Setting,"INTRODUCTION: Healthcare systems aim to maximize the health of the population, but must work within constrained budgets. Therefore, choosing therapies that are both effective and cost-effective is paramount. The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg versus once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg and versus once daily sitagliptin 100 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control on oral anti-hyperglycemic medications over patient lifetimes from a healthcare payer perspective in the Spanish setting. METHODS: Cost and clinical outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects on initiation of semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg, dulaglutide 1.5 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg were based on the once-weekly semaglutide clinical trial program (SUSTAIN 7 and 2). Captured costs included treatment costs and costs of diabetes-related complications. Projected outcomes were discounted at 3.0% annually. RESULTS: Projections of long-term clinical outcomes indicated that once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with improvements in discounted life expectancy of 0.02 and 0.11 years, respectively, and discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.03 and 0.11 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Compared with sitagliptin, once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with improvements in discounted life expectancy of 0.17 and 0.24 years, respectively and discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.16 and 0.23 QALYs. The increased duration and quality of life with once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg resulted from a reduced cumulative incidence and delayed time to onset of diabetes-related complications.

Therefore, choosing therapies that are both effective and cost-effective is paramount. The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg versus once-weekly dulaglutide 1.5 mg and versus once daily sitagliptin 100 mg for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control on oral anti-hyperglycemic medications over patient lifetimes from a healthcare payer perspective in the Spanish setting. METHODS: Cost and clinical outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects on initiation of semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg, dulaglutide 1.5 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg were based on the once-weekly semaglutide clinical trial program (SUSTAIN 7 and 2). Captured costs included treatment costs and costs of diabetes-related complications. Projected outcomes were discounted at 3.0% annually. RESULTS: Projections of long-term clinical outcomes indicated that once-weekly semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with improvements in discounted life expectancy of 0.02 and 0.11 years, respectively, and discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.03 and 0.11 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively, versus dulaglutide 1.5 mg.

25058,Changing the Health Behavior of Patients With Cardiovascular Disease Through an Electronic Health Intervention in Three Different Countries: Cost-Effectiveness Study in the Do Cardiac Health: Advanced New Generation Ecosystem (Do CHANGE) 2 Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: During the last few decades, preventing the development of cardiovascular disease has become a mainstay for reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It has been suggested that interventions should focus more on committed approaches of self-care, such as electronic health techniques. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide evidence to understand the financial consequences of implementing the ""Do Cardiac Health: Advanced New Generation Ecosystem"" (Do CHANGE 2) intervention, which was evaluated in a multisite randomized controlled trial to change the health behavior of patients with cardiovascular disease. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis of the Do CHANGE 2 intervention was performed with the Monitoring and Assessment Framework for the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing tool, based on a Markov model of five health states. The following two types of costs were considered for both study groups: (1) health care costs (ie, costs associated with the time spent by health care professionals on service provision, including consultations, and associated unplanned hospitalizations, etc) and (2) societal costs (ie, costs attributed to the time spent by patients and informal caregivers on care activities). RESULTS: The Do CHANGE 2 intervention was less costly in Spain (incremental cost was -€2514.90) and more costly in the Netherlands and Taiwan (incremental costs were €1373.59 and €1062.54, respectively). Compared with treatment as usual, the effectiveness of the Do CHANGE 2 program in terms of an increase in quality-adjusted life-year gains was slightly higher in the Netherlands and lower in Spain and Taiwan. CONCLUSIONS: In general, we found that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio strongly varied depending on the country where the intervention was applied. The Do CHANGE 2 intervention showed a positive cost-effectiveness ratio only when implemented in Spain, indicating that it saved financial costs in relation to the effect of the intervention.

Yet, their comparative health and economic impacts have not been quantified, in particular, tiered or sugar content taxes that provide industry incentives for sugar reduction. METHODS: We estimated incremental changes in diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, quality-adjusted life-years, costs, and cost-effectiveness of 3 sugar-sweetened beverage tax designs in the United States, on the basis of (1) volume ($0.01/oz), (2) tiers (<5 g of added sugar/8 oz: no tax; 5-20 g/8 oz: $0.01/oz; and >20 g/8 oz: $0.02/oz), and (3) absolute sugar content ($0.01 per teaspoon added sugar), each compared with a base case of modest ongoing voluntary industry reformulation. A validated microsimulation model, CVD-PREDICT (Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model for Risk, Events, Detection, Interventions, Costs, and Trends), incorporated national demographic and dietary data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, policy effects and sugar-sweetened beverage-related diseases from meta-analyses, and industry reformulation and health-related costs from established sources. RESULTS: Over a lifetime, the volume, tiered, and absolute sugar content taxes would generate $80.4 billion, $142 billion, and $41.7 billion in tax revenue, respectively. From a healthcare perspective, the volume tax would prevent 850?000 cardiovascular disease (95% CI, 836?000-864?000) and 269?000 diabetes mellitus (265?000-274?000) cases, gain 2.44 million quality-adjusted life-years (2.40-2.48), and save $53.2 billion net costs (52.3-54.1).

25064,Cost-utility analysis of newborn hepatitis B immunization in Beijing,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cost-utility of universal Hepatitis B vaccination program in the Beijing city (Beijing). METHODS: A decision-Markov model was constructed to determine the cost-utility of the universal immunization program for infants (universal vaccination program) by comparing with a hypothetic nonvaccination strategy in Beijing. Parameters in models were extracted from Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) annual work report, Beijing health statistical yearbook, National Health Survey report, Beijing 1% population sample survey report, Beijing Health and Medical Price Monitoring Data Platform, and public literatures. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was used to compare alternative scenarios. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were used to assess parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The universal vaccination program had increased the utility and reduced cost among infants born in 2016 in Beijing. The ICUR was CNY -24,576.61 (US$ -3779.16) per QALY for universal vaccination program comparing with non-vaccination scenario from healthcare perspective. It was estimated that the universal vaccination would save direct medical treatment cost of CNY 2,262,869,173.50 (US$ 347,962,414.43) and prevent loss of 18322.25 QALYs within lifetime of target cohort. Discount rate accounted for the most remarkable influence on ICUR in one-way sensitivity analysis. The result of probabilistic sensitivity analysis illustrated that all of the ICURs were located in the fourth quadrant of the cost-utility incremental plot undergone 5000 times of Monte Carlo simulation. CONCLUSIONS: Current universal hepatitis B vaccination program in Beijing was highly cost utility. The investment was reasonable for current universal vaccination program in Beijing.",2020-01-35122,33016814,Int. J.

25065,Cost-Effectiveness and Quality-Adjusted Survival of Watch and Wait After Complete Response to Chemoradiotherapy for Rectal Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by total mesorectal excision (TME) is the standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. There is interest in deescalating local therapy after a clinical complete response to CRT. We hypothesized that a watch-and-wait (WW) strategy offers comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and reduced cost compared with upfront TME. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare WW, low anterior resection, and abdominoperineal resection for patients achieving a clinical complete response to CRT. Rates of local regrowth, pelvic recurrence, and distant metastasis were derived from series comparing WW with TME after pathologic complete response. Lifetime incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were calculated between strategies, and sensitivity analyses were performed to study model uncertainty. RESULTS: The base case 5-year cancer-specific survival was 93.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91.5% to 94.9%) on a WW program compared with 95.9% (95% CI = 93.6% to 97.4%) after upfront TME. WW was dominant relative to low anterior resection, with cost savings of $28?500 (95% CI = $22?200 to $39?000) and incremental QALY of 0.527 (95% CI = 0.138 to 1.125). WW was also dominant relative to abdominoperineal resection, with a cost savings of $32?100 (95% CI = $21?800 to $49?200) and incremental QALY of 0.601 (95% CI = 0.213 to 1.208).

25068,Cost Effectiveness of Teplizumab for Prevention of Type 1 Diabetes Among Different Target Patient Groups,"OBJECTIVE: Teplizumab was recently shown to be the first-ever drug to prevent or delay type 1 diabetes mellitus onset in at-risk individuals, especially those with certain genetic and antibody characteristics. However, its potentially high price may pose challenges for coverage and reimbursement for payers and policymakers. Thus, it is critical to investigate the cost effectiveness of this drug for different target individuals. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using Markov microsimulation modeling, we compared the cost effectiveness of five options for choosing target individuals (i.e., all at-risk individuals, individuals without human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3 or with HLA-DR4 allele, individuals without HLA-DR3 and with HLA-DR4 allele, individuals with anti-zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) antibody negative, and no provision at all) at different possible prices of teplizumab. Effectiveness was measured by quality-adjusted life-years. Costs were estimated from a health system perspective. RESULTS: If the price of teplizumab is below US$48,900, treating all at-risk individuals is cost effective. However, it will be cost effective to treat only individuals without HLA-DR3 or with HLA-DR4 alleles for prices between US$48,900 and US$58,200, only individuals both without HLA-DR3 and with HLA-DR4 alleles for prices between US$58,200 and US$88,300, and only individuals with negative ZnT8 antibody status for prices between US$88,300 and US$193,700. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effective provision of teplizumab to target individuals depends on the price of teplizumab and genetic and antibody characteristics of treated individuals.

25072,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Anatomic vs Functional Index Testing in Patients With Low-Risk Stable Chest Pain,"IMPORTANCE: Both noninvasive anatomic and functional testing strategies are now routinely used as initial workup in patients with low-risk stable chest pain (SCP). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether anatomic approaches (ie, coronary computed tomography angiography [CTA] and coronary CTA supplemented with noninvasive fractional flow reserve [FFRCT], performed in patients with 30% to 69% stenosis) are cost-effective compared with functional testing for the assessment of low-risk SCP. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cost-effectiveness analysis used an individual-based Markov microsimulation model for low-risk SCP. The model was developed using patient data from the Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain (PROMISE) trial. The model was validated by comparing model outcomes with outcomes observed in the PROMISE trial for anatomic (coronary CTA) and functional (stress testing) strategies, including diagnostic test results, referral to invasive coronary angiography (ICA), coronary revascularization, incident major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), and costs during 60 days and 2 years. The validated model was used to determine whether anatomic approaches are cost-effective over a lifetime compared with functional testing. EXPOSURE: Choice of index test for evaluation of low-risk SCP. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Downstream ICA and coronary revascularization, MACE (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction), cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of competing strategies. RESULTS: The model cohort included 10?003 individual patients (median [interquartile range] age, 60.0 [54.4-65.9] years; 5270 [52.7%] women; 7693 [77.4%] White individuals), who entered the model 100 times. The Markov model accurately estimated the test assignment, results of anatomic and functional index testing, referral to ICA, revascularization, MACE, and costs at 60 days and 2 years compared with observed data in PROMISE (eg, coronary CTA: ICA, 12.2% [95% CI, 10.9%-13.5%] vs 12.3% [95% CI, 12.2%-12.4%]; revascularization, 6.2% [95% CI, 5.5%-6.9%] vs 6.4% [95% CI, 6.3%-6.5%]; functional strategy: ICA, 8.1% [95% CI, 7.4%-8.9%] vs 8.2% [95% CI, 8.1%-8.3%]; revascularization, 3.2% [95% CI, 2.7%-3.7%] vs 3.3% [95% CI, 3.2%-3.4%]; 2-year MACE rates: coronary CTA, 2.1% [95% CI, 1.7%-2.5%] vs 2.3% [95% CI, 2.2%-2.4%]; functional strategy, 2.2% [95% CI, 1.8%-2.6%] vs 2.4% [95% CI, 2.3%-2.4%]). Anatomic approaches led to higher ICA and revascularization rates at 60 days, 2 years, and 5 years compared with functional testing but were more effective in patient selection for ICA (eg, 60-day revascularization-to-ICA ratio, CTA: 53.7% [95% CI, 53.3%-54.0%]; CTA with FFRCT: 59.5% [95% CI, 59.2%-59.8%]; functional testing: 40.7% [95% CI, 40.4%-50.0%]). Over a lifetime, anatomic approaches gained an additional 6 months in perfect health compared with functional testing (CTA, 25.16 [95% CI, 25.14-25.19] QALYs; CTA with FFRCT, 25.14 [95% CI, 25.12-25.17] QALYs; functional testing, 24.68 [95% CI, 24.66-24.70] QALYs). Anatomic strategies were less costly and more effective; thus, CTA with FFRCT dominated and CTA alone was cost-effective (ICERs ranged from $1912/QALY for women and $3,559/QALY for men) compared with functional testing. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, anatomic approaches were cost-effective in more than 65% of scenarios, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000/QALY.

RESULTS: The model cohort included 10?003 individual patients (median [interquartile range] age, 60.0 [54.4-65.9] years; 5270 [52.7%] women; 7693 [77.4%] White individuals), who entered the model 100 times. The Markov model accurately estimated the test assignment, results of anatomic and functional index testing, referral to ICA, revascularization, MACE, and costs at 60 days and 2 years compared with observed data in PROMISE (eg, coronary CTA: ICA, 12.2% [95% CI, 10.9%-13.5%] vs 12.3% [95% CI, 12.2%-12.4%]; revascularization, 6.2% [95% CI, 5.5%-6.9%] vs 6.4% [95% CI, 6.3%-6.5%]; functional strategy: ICA, 8.1% [95% CI, 7.4%-8.9%] vs 8.2% [95% CI, 8.1%-8.3%]; revascularization, 3.2% [95% CI, 2.7%-3.7%] vs 3.3% [95% CI, 3.2%-3.4%]; 2-year MACE rates: coronary CTA, 2.1% [95% CI, 1.7%-2.5%] vs 2.3% [95% CI, 2.2%-2.4%]; functional strategy, 2.2% [95% CI, 1.8%-2.6%] vs 2.4% [95% CI, 2.3%-2.4%]). Anatomic approaches led to higher ICA and revascularization rates at 60 days, 2 years, and 5 years compared with functional testing but were more effective in patient selection for ICA (eg, 60-day revascularization-to-ICA ratio, CTA: 53.7% [95% CI, 53.3%-54.0%]; CTA with FFRCT: 59.5% [95% CI, 59.2%-59.8%]; functional testing: 40.7% [95% CI, 40.4%-50.0%]). Over a lifetime, anatomic approaches gained an additional 6 months in perfect health compared with functional testing (CTA, 25.16 [95% CI, 25.14-25.19] QALYs; CTA with FFRCT, 25.14 [95% CI, 25.12-25.17] QALYs; functional testing, 24.68 [95% CI, 24.66-24.70] QALYs). Anatomic strategies were less costly and more effective; thus, CTA with FFRCT dominated and CTA alone was cost-effective (ICERs ranged from $1912/QALY for women and $3,559/QALY for men) compared with functional testing. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, anatomic approaches were cost-effective in more than 65% of scenarios, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000/QALY.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) have demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular and renal complications, including hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) and renal disease progression, in randomized clinical trials. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the SGLT2i class versus standard of care in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using evidence from both clinical trial and real-world studies. METHODS: An established T2DM model was adapted to use contemporary outcomes evidence from real-world studies and randomized controlled trial evaluations of SGLT2i, and extrapolated over a lifetime for HHF, myocardial infarction, stroke, end-stage renal disease and all-cause mortality. The economic analysis considered adults with T2DM, with and without established cardiovascular disease, and was conducted over a lifetime from the perspective of the health care payer in the United Kingdom, United States and China, discounted at country-specific rates. RESULTS: SGLT2i were consistently associated with increased treatment costs, reduced complication costs and gains in quality-adjusted life years driven by differences in projected life expectancy, cardiovascular and microvascular morbidity and weight loss. SGLT2i were estimated to be cost-saving or cost-effective at relevant thresholds for the overall population in the United Kingdom, United States and China, with cost-effectiveness being the greatest in higher risk subgroups.

25080,Cost-Effectiveness of Treatment Strategies with Biologics in Accordance with Treatment Guidelines for Ankylosing Spondylitis: A Patient-Level Model,"BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a form of rheumatic disease caused by chronic inflammation of the axial skeleton. Patients with AS experience significant functional limitations and reduced quality of life. Consequently, AS imposes a substantial economic burden on society due to productivity loss and work disability. Biologics, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody (IL-17A) agents, are effective treatment strategies in relieving symptoms and slowing down disease progression. Currently, 5 TNF inhibitors and 2 IL-17A antibody agents are approved by the FDA for the management of AS. Of these agents, there is no clear preferred agent in initial biologic therapy, although an IL-17A antibody agent or alternative TNF inhibitor agent is recommended after failure of the initial TNF inhibitor therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies with biologics, TNF inhibitor or IL-17A, in accordance with the treatment guidelines for patients with AS. METHODS: An economic patient-level simulation combining decision-tree and Markov models was constructed from the U.S. health care payer''s perspective over a 10-year time horizon. The current model examined 5 treatment strategies: (1) conventional care treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, (2) 1 TNF inhibitor, (3) an IL-17A antibody agent, (4) sequential therapy with 2 TNF inhibitors, and (5) sequential therapy with a TNF inhibitor followed by an IL-17A antibody agent. Initially, treatment responses were determined after 12-week treatments. Patients who responded to treatment entered a ""responders"" Markov model. Patients entered a ""nonresponders"" Markov model if they inadequately responded to treatment. In sequential treatment strategies, patients who inadequately responded to treatment with the first TNF inhibitor received a second TNF inhibitor or an IL-17A antibody agent. Health utility was estimated based on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Functional Index (BASFI) scores. The models accounted for real-world adherence to TNF inhibitor treatment. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness and uncertainty of the model results. RESULTS: Over a 10-year time horizon and 100,000 simulated patients for each treatment strategy, base-case results produced average total discounted per-patient costs of $19,765, $130,302, $159,934, $190,553, and $179,118 and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 4.675, 5.410, 5.499, 5.919, and 5.893 for conventional care, treatment strategies with 1 TNF inhibitor, an IL-17A, 2 TNF inhibitors, and a TNF inhibitor followed by an IL-17A, respectively. The optimal treatments at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds = $130,813 per QALY, between $130,813 per QALY and $442,728 per QALY, and > $442,728 per QALY were conventional care and sequential treatment strategies with 1 TNF inhibitor, followed by an IL-17A agent and 2 TNF inhibitors, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Study findings suggested that all treatment strategies with biologics, TNF inhibitors or IL-17A antibody agents, in the treatment guidelines for AS were not cost-effective at the common WTP of $100,000 per QALY. However, the sequential treatment with 1 TNF inhibitor followed by an IL-17A antibody agent was considered cost-effective at a higher WTP of $150,000 per QALY.

RESULTS: Over a 10-year time horizon and 100,000 simulated patients for each treatment strategy, base-case results produced average total discounted per-patient costs of $19,765, $130,302, $159,934, $190,553, and $179,118 and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 4.675, 5.410, 5.499, 5.919, and 5.893 for conventional care, treatment strategies with 1 TNF inhibitor, an IL-17A, 2 TNF inhibitors, and a TNF inhibitor followed by an IL-17A, respectively.

25083,Cost-Effectiveness of Treatment Strategies with Biologics in Accordance with Treatment Guidelines for Ankylosing Spondylitis: A Patient-Level Model,"BACKGROUND: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a form of rheumatic disease caused by chronic inflammation of the axial skeleton. Patients with AS experience significant functional limitations and reduced quality of life. Consequently, AS imposes a substantial economic burden on society due to productivity loss and work disability. Biologics, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody (IL-17A) agents, are effective treatment strategies in relieving symptoms and slowing down disease progression. Currently, 5 TNF inhibitors and 2 IL-17A antibody agents are approved by the FDA for the management of AS. Of these agents, there is no clear preferred agent in initial biologic therapy, although an IL-17A antibody agent or alternative TNF inhibitor agent is recommended after failure of the initial TNF inhibitor therapy. OBJECTIVE: To assess cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies with biologics, TNF inhibitor or IL-17A, in accordance with the treatment guidelines for patients with AS. METHODS: An economic patient-level simulation combining decision-tree and Markov models was constructed from the U.S. health care payer''s perspective over a 10-year time horizon. The current model examined 5 treatment strategies: (1) conventional care treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, (2) 1 TNF inhibitor, (3) an IL-17A antibody agent, (4) sequential therapy with 2 TNF inhibitors, and (5) sequential therapy with a TNF inhibitor followed by an IL-17A antibody agent. Initially, treatment responses were determined after 12-week treatments. Patients who responded to treatment entered a ""responders"" Markov model. Patients entered a ""nonresponders"" Markov model if they inadequately responded to treatment. In sequential treatment strategies, patients who inadequately responded to treatment with the first TNF inhibitor received a second TNF inhibitor or an IL-17A antibody agent. Health utility was estimated based on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Functional Index (BASFI) scores. The models accounted for real-world adherence to TNF inhibitor treatment. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness and uncertainty of the model results.

25084,Evaluating the Outcomes of a Hospital-to-Community Model of Integrated Care for Dementia,"INTRODUCTION: Living with dementia is challenging for persons with dementia (PWDs) and their families. Although multi-component intervention, underscored by the ethos of person-centred care, has been shown to maintain quality of life (QOL) in PWDs and caregivers, a lack of service integration can hinder effectiveness. METHODS: CARITAS, an integrated care initiative provided through a hospital-community care partnership, endeavours to provide person-centred dementia care through ambulatory clinic consults, case management, patient and caregiver engagement, and support. We evaluated CARITAS'' clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness with a naturalistic cross-sectional within-subject design. We assessed patients'' function, QOL, and behavioural problems post-intervention. We estimated CARITAS'' cost-effectiveness from a patient''s perspective, benchmarking it against other dementia treatments and Singapore''s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. RESULTS: CARITAS care significantly improved health utility (p < 0.001), reduced caregiver burden (p < 0.001), and improved PWDs'' behavioural problems (p < 0.001) related to ""memory"" (p < 0.001), ""disruption"" (p = 0.017), and ""depression"" (p < 0.001). CARITAS'' benefits (dRMBPC = 0.357, dEQ5D index = 0.328, dZBI = 0.361) were comparable to those of other pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for dementia. CARITAS costs SG$133,056.69 per quality-adjusted life years gain, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 1.31 and 1.49 against the cost of donepezil in patients with mild Alz-heimer''s disease and Singapore''s GDP per capita in 2019, respectively, falling within the cost-effectiveness threshold of 1.0-3.0.

25085,Potential Unintended Consequences of National Infectious Disease Screening Strategies in Deceased Donor Kidney Transplantation: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: In order to counter the lack of sufficient kidney donors, there has been interest in expanding the utilization of organs from increased infectious-risk donors. Negative nucleic acid testing of increased infectious-risk organs has been shown to increase their use as compared to only enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay negativity. However, it is not known how the expanded use of nucleic acid testing on a national scale might affect total donor utilization. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper was to determine if a national screening policy requiring the use of nucleic acid testing in both increased infectious-risk and non-increased infectious-risk renal transplant donors would increase the donor organ pool. METHODS: This study used decision-tree analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness of four US national screening policies based on an increasingly expansive use of nucleic acid testing for increased infectious-risk and non-increased infectious-risk kidneys. Parameters were taken from the literature. All costs were reported in 2020 US dollars using a Medicare payer perspective and a life-time horizon. RESULTS: The use of nucleic acid screening solely for increased infectious-risk organs was the dominant strategy. Our results were robust to deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. One of the main driving factors of cost-effectiveness was the false-positive rate of nucleic acid testing.

25088,Utility of routine evaluations for rejection in patients greater than 2 years after heart transplantation,"AIMS: Guidelines support routine surveillance testing for rejection for at least 5 years after heart transplant (HT). In patients greater than 2 years post-HT, we examined which clinical characteristics predict continuation of routine surveillance studies, outcomes following discontinuation of routine surveillance, and the cost-effectiveness of different surveillance strategies. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively identified subjects older than 18 who underwent a first HT at our centre from 2007 to 2016 and who survived =760 days (n = 217) post-HT. The clinical context surrounding all endomyocardial biopsies (EMBs) and gene expression profiles (GEPs) was reviewed to determine if studies were performed routinely or were triggered by a change in clinical status. Subjects were categorized as following a test-based surveillance (n = 159) or a signs/symptoms surveillance (n = 53) strategy based on treating cardiologist intent to continue routine studies after the second post-transplant year. A Markov model was constructed to compare two test-based surveillance strategies to a baseline strategy of discontinuing routine studies. One thousand twenty studies were performed; 835 were routine. Significant rejection was absent in 99.0% of routine EMBs and 99.8% of routine GEPs. The treating cardiologist''s practice duration, patient age, and immunosuppressive regimen predicted surveillance strategy. There were no differences in outcomes between groups. Routine surveillance EMBs cost more and were marginally less effective than a strategy of discontinuing routine studies after 2 years; surveillance GEPs had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1.67 million/quality-adjusted life-year.

25090,The cost-effectiveness of intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering in people with peripheral artery disease,"BACKGROUND: People with peripheral artery disease are at a high risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and major adverse limb events (MALE). Randomized controlled trials suggest that intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors is an effective strategy to prevent these events. This study estimated the potential benefit and cost-effectiveness of administrating PCSK9 inhibitors to a cohort of participants with peripheral artery disease. METHODS: A total of 783 participants with intermittent claudication (IC; n = 582) or chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI; n = 201) were prospectively recruited from three hospitals in Australia. Serum LDL-C was measured at recruitment, and the occurrence of MACE and MALE was recorded over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 2.2 years (0.3-5.7 years). The potential benefit of administering a PCSK9 inhibitor was estimated by calculating the absolute risk reduction and numbers needed to treat (NNT) based on relative risk reductions reported in published randomized trials. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life year gained was estimated. RESULTS: Intensive LDL-C lowering was estimated to lead to an absolute risk reduction in MACE of 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-9.3; NNT, 16) and MALE of 13.7% (95% CI, 4.3-21.5; NNT, 7) in people with CLTI compared with 3.2% (95% CI, 1.1-4.8; NNT, 32) and 5.3% (95% CI, 1.7-8.3; NNT, 19) in people with IC. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over a 10-year period were $55,270 USD and $32,800 USD for participants with IC and CLTI, respectively.

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life year gained was estimated. RESULTS: Intensive LDL-C lowering was estimated to lead to an absolute risk reduction in MACE of 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-9.3; NNT, 16) and MALE of 13.7% (95% CI, 4.3-21.5; NNT, 7) in people with CLTI compared with 3.2% (95% CI, 1.1-4.8; NNT, 32) and 5.3% (95% CI, 1.7-8.3; NNT, 19) in people with IC. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over a 10-year period were $55,270 USD and $32,800 USD for participants with IC and CLTI, respectively.

Randomized controlled trials suggest that intensive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors is an effective strategy to prevent these events. This study estimated the potential benefit and cost-effectiveness of administrating PCSK9 inhibitors to a cohort of participants with peripheral artery disease. METHODS: A total of 783 participants with intermittent claudication (IC; n = 582) or chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI; n = 201) were prospectively recruited from three hospitals in Australia.

25096,"Atrial Fibrillation Screen, Management, and Guideline-Recommended Therapy in the Rural Primary Care Setting: A Cross-Sectional Study and Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of eHealth Tools to Support All Stages of Screening","BACKGROUND Internationally, most atrial fibrillation (AF) management guidelines recommend opportunistic screening for AF in people =65 years of age and oral anticoagulant treatment for those at high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VA=2). However, gaps remain in screening and treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS General practitioners/nurses at practices in rural Australia (n=8) screened eligible patients (=65 years of age without AF) using a smartphone ECG during practice visits. eHealth tools included electronic prompts, guideline-based electronic decision support, and regular data reports. Clinical audit tools extracted de-identified data. Results were compared with an earlier study in metropolitan practices (n=8) and nonrandomized control practices (n=69). Cost-effectiveness analysis compared population-based screening with no screening and included screening, treatment, and hospitalization costs for stroke and serious bleeding events. Patients (n=3103, 34%) were screened (mean age, 75.1±6.8 years; 47% men) and 36 (1.2%) new AF cases were confirmed (mean age, 77.0 years; 64% men; mean CHA2DS2-VA, 3.2). Oral anticoagulant treatment rates for patients with CHA2DS2-VA=2 were 82% (screen detected) versus 74% (preexisting AF)(P=NS), similar to metropolitan and nonrandomized control practices. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for population-based screening was AU$16 578 per quality-adjusted life year gained and AU$84 383 per stroke prevented compared with no screening. National implementation would prevent 147 strokes per year. Increasing the proportion screened to 75% would prevent 177 additional strokes per year. CONCLUSIONS An AF screening program in rural practices, supported by eHealth tools, screened 34% of eligible patients and was cost-effective. Oral anticoagulant treatment rates were relatively high at baseline, trending upward during the study. Increasing the proportion screened would prevent many more strokes with minimal incremental cost-effectiveness ratio change. eHealth tools, including data reports, may be a valuable addition to future programs.

25097,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate Health Index in Decision Making for Initial Prostate Biopsy,"BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have suggested that prostate health index (phi) outperforms prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests in prostate cancer detection. The cost-effectiveness of phi with different cutoffs is poorly understood in the context of decision making for prostate biopsy. METHODS: In a multicenter cohort, 3,348 men with elevated total PSA (tPSA) underwent initial prostate biopsy from August 2013 to May 2019. We constructed a decision model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of different phi cutoffs. Total costs and reimbursement payments were based on the fee schedule of Shanghai Basic Medical Insurance and converted into United States dollars ($). Two willingness-to-pay thresholds were estimated as one or three times the average gross domestic product per capita of China ($7,760 or $23,279, respectively). RESULTS: The total costs of prostate biopsy and PSA tests were estimated at $315 and $19, respectively. The cost of phi test varied between $72 to $130 in different medical centers. Under different phi cutoffs (from 23 to 35), phi test predicted reductions of 420 (21.7%) to 972 (50.2%) in unnecessary biopsies, with a total gain of 23.77-57.58 quality adjusted life-years compared to PSA tests. All the cutoffs would be cost-effective for patients with tPSA levels of 2-10 ng/ml. Applying 27 as the cutoff was cost-effective for each tPSA range, with missing positive cases ranging from 11 (3.4%) to 33 (11.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Using phi test was cost-effective in the decision-making process for initial prostate biopsy, especially for patients with tPSA values between 2-10 ng/ml.
