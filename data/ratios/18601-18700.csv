18601,Cost-effectiveness of oral agents in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis compared to interferon-based therapy in Saudi Arabia,"BACKGROUND: Promising clinical and humanistic outcomes are associated with the use of new oral agents in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). This is the first cost-effectiveness study comparing these medications in Saudi Arabia. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, and interferon (IFN)-b1a products (Avonex and Rebif) as first-line therapies in the treatment of patients with RRMS from a Saudi payer perspective. DESIGN: Cohort Simulation Model (Markov Model). SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. METHODS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 RRMS Saudi patients was assumed to enter a Markov model model with a time horizon of 20 years and an annual cycle length. The model was developed based on an expanded disability status scale (EDSS) to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the five disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) from a healthcare system perspective. Data on EDSS progression and relapse rates were obtained from the literature; cost data were obtained from King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Results were expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefits (NMB) in Saudi Riyals and converted to equivalent $US. The base-case willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was assumed to be $100000 (SAR375000). One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to test the robustness of the model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ICERs and NMB. RESULTS: The base-case analysis results showed Rebif as the optimal therapy at a WTP threshold of $100000. Avonex had the lowest ICER value of $337282/QALY when compared to Rebif. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the results were sensitive to utility weights of health state three and four and the cost of Rebif. CONCLUSION: None of the DMDs were found to be cost-effective in the treatment of RRMS at a WTP threshold of $100000 in this analysis. The DMDs would only be cost-effective at a WTP above $300000.

18605,Indacaterol/glycopyrronium is cost-effective compared to salmeterol/fluticasone in COPD: FLAME-based modelling in a Swedish population,"BACKGROUND: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) versus salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with moderate to very severe airflow limitation and >/=1 exacerbation in the preceding year. METHODS: A previously published and validated patient-level simulation model was adapted using clinical data from the FLAME trial and real-world cost data from the ARCTIC study. Costs (total monetary costs comprising drug, maintenance, exacerbation, and pneumonia costs) and health outcomes (life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) were projected over various time horizons (1, 5, 10 years, and lifetime) from the Swedish payer''s perspective and were discounted at 3% annually. Uncertainty in model input values was studied through one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analyses were also performed. RESULTS: IND/GLY was associated with lower costs and better outcomes compared with SFC over all the analysed time horizons. Use of IND/GLY resulted in additional 0.192 LYs and 0.134 QALYs with cost savings of euro1211 compared with SFC over lifetime. The net monetary benefit (NMB) was estimated to be euro8560 based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro55,000/QALY. The NMB was higher in the following subgroups: severe (GOLD 3), high risk and more symptoms (GOLD D), females, and current smokers.

18606,Cost-Effectiveness of Internet-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Bulimia Nervosa: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for bulimia nervosa (CBT-BN) compared to face-to-face delivery of CBT-BN. METHODS: This study is a planned secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial. Participants were 179 adults (98% female, mean age = 28 years) meeting DSM-IV criteria for bulimia nervosa who were randomized to group face-to-face or group Internet-based CBT-BN for 16 sessions during 20 weeks. The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a third-party payor perspective, and a partial societal perspective analysis was conducted to investigate cost-utility (ie, cost per gain in quality-adjusted life-years) and patient out-of-pocket travel-related costs. Net health care costs were calculated from protocol and nonprotocol health care services using third-party payor cost estimates. The primary outcome measure in the clinical trial was abstinence from binge eating and purging, and the trial start and end dates were 2008 and 2016. RESULTS: The mean cost per abstinent patient at posttreatment was $7,757 (95% confidence limit [CL], $4,515, $13,361) for face-to-face and $11,870 (95% CL, $6,486, $22,188) for Internet-based CBT-BN, and at 1-year follow-up was $16,777 (95% CL, $10,298, $27,042) for face-to-face and $14,561 (95% CL, $10,165, $21,028) for Internet-based CBT-BN. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms in cost-effectiveness or cost-utility at posttreatment or 1-year follow-up. Out-of-pocket patient costs were significantly higher for face-to-face (mean [95% CL] = $178 [$127, $140]) than Internet-based ($50 [$50, $50]) therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Third-party payor cost-effectiveness of Internet-based CBT-BN is comparable with that of an accepted standard. Internet-based dissemination of CBT-BN may be a viable alternative for patients geographically distant from specialist eating disorder services who have an unmet need for treatment.

18607,Cost-utility analysis of idelalisib in combination with rituximab in relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of idelalisib in combination with rituximab (IR) versus rituximab monotherapy (R) in the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), from the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival Markov model for a lifetime horizon (30 years) was developed to estimate costs (euro, 2016) and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) with IR and R. Initial cohort included patients with CLL receiving a second or subsequent line (2L) of treatment with IR or R. Survival data were based on CLL clinical trial. Drug, administration, monitoring, adverse events and clinical management of CLL costs were included in the model. Costs and outcomes were discounted using a 3% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed. RESULTS: Compared to R, 2L IR treatment resulted in QALY gain of 3.147 (4.965 versus 1.818). Total costs were euro118 254 for IR versus euro23 874 for R. ICUR was euro29 990/QALY gained with IR versus R. In the PSA, IR was cost-effective in 78% of iterations using a threshold of euro45 000/QALY.

If the MMS screening method is eventually shown to reduce mortality and be cost-effective, then it may be accepted by the medical community as a feasible screening tool. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an MMS screening program in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: A Markov simulation model was constructed using data from UKCTOCS to compare MMS with no screening in the United States. Screening would begin at the age of 50 years for women in the general population. Published estimates of the long-term effect of MMS screening on ovarian cancer mortality and the trial''s published hazard ratios were used to simulate mortality estimates up to 40 years from start of screening. Base-case costs included CA-125, ultrasound, and false-positive work-up results, in addition to a risk algorithm cost estimate of $100. The utility and costs of ovarian cancer treatment were incorporated into the model. Interventions: Screening strategies varied by costs of the algorithm and treatment for advanced ovarian cancer, rates of screening compliance, ovarian cancer incidence, and extrapolation of ovarian cancer mortality. Main Outcomes and Measures: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and mortality reduction of ovarian cancer screening. Results: Multimodal screening is both more expensive and more effective in reducing ovarian cancer mortality over a lifetime than no screening. After accounting for uncertainty in the underlying parameters, screening women starting at age 50 years with MMS is cost-effective 70% of the time, when decision makers are willing to pay $150000 per QALY. Screening reduced mortality by 15%, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranging from $106187 (95% CI, $97496-$127793) to $155256 (95% CI, $150369-$198567). Conclusions and Relevance: Ovarian cancer screening is potentially cost-effective in the United States depending on final significance of mortality reduction and cost of the CA-125 risk algorithm. These results are limited by uncertainty around the effect of screening on ovarian cancer mortality beyond the 11 years of UKCTOCS.",2017-01-25784,29222541,Int Health,Haley A Moss,2017,/,,No,29222541,"Haley A Moss; Andrew Berchuck; Megan L Neely; Evan R Myers; Laura J Havrilesky; Estimating Cost-effectiveness of a Multimodal Ovarian Cancer Screening Program in the United States: Secondary Analysis of the UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKCTOCS), Int Health, 2017 Oct 05; ():1876-3405",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Multimodal Ovarian Cancer Screening vs. None,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,137500,United States,2016,148272.81
18613,Non-targeted HIV screening in emergency departments in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: In the Netherlands a substantial proportion of newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients present late for care and an estimated 12-34% of people living with HIV are undiagnosed. Linkage to care of these patients is important to decrease HIV transmission and to improve individual patient outcomes. We investigated if non-targeted HIV testing in emergency departments is a useful and cost-effective way to identify these patients. METHODS: In a cross-sectional multicentre study, eligible adult patients who underwent phlebotomy were given an active choice to be additionally tested for HIV. In a subset of patients, risk factors for HIV infection were asked for. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Of 7577 eligible patients, 3223 patients were tested, and two new HIV infections were diagnosed (0.06%). Both patients had risk factors for HIV infection. Non-targeted HIV testing in the emergency department was not considered cost-effective, with a cost per quality adjusted life years gained of euro 77,050, more than triple the Dutch cost-effectiveness threshold of euro 20,000. CONCLUSION: Non-targeted HIV testing in emergency departments in the Netherlands had a low yield of newly diagnosed HIV infections and was not cost-effective.

18614,"Economic value of using partially hydrolysed infant formula for risk reduction of atopic dermatitis in high-risk, not exclusively breastfed infants in Singapore","INTRODUCTION: Previous trials have demonstrated reductions in atopic dermatitis (AD) incidence when healthy, high-risk, non-exclusively breastfed infants were fed until four months of age with 100% whey-based partially hydrolysed formula (PHF-W) versus standard cow''s milk formula (CMF). We assessed this intervention''s cost-effectiveness in Singapore. METHODS: Modelling techniques were used to simulate, from birth to Month 30, the incidence, and clinical and economic burden of AD in high-risk, non-exclusively breastfed infants fed with PHF-W or CMF for up to four months. Epidemiologic and clinical data were from a local comparative trial. Expert opinion informed AD treatment patterns and outcomes. Outcomes included reduction in AD risk, time spent with AD, days without AD flare, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct/indirect costs. Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis assessed model parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Over 30 months, with the use of PHF-W instead of CMF, the proportion of children who developed AD and time spent with AD decreased by 16.0% (28.3% vs. 44.3%) and 6.4 months, respectively, while time without AD flare and QALYs increased by 14.9 days and 0.021 QALYs per patient, respectively. Estimated AD-related discounted cost per child for PHF-W and CMF was SGD 771 and SGD 1,309, respectively (net savings = SGD 538). PHF-W was less expensive and more effective than CMF for 72.5%, and costs less than SGD 50,000 per QALY for 87.2% of all multivariate simulations. CONCLUSION: Early short-term nutritional intervention with PHF-W instead of CMF may reduce AD incidence and costs in healthy, high-risk, non-exclusively breastfed infants in Singapore.",2017-01-25788,29214323,Singapore Med J,Marc F Botteman,2017,/,,No,29214323,"Marc F Botteman; Abhijeet J Bhanegaonkar; Erica G Horodniceanu; Xiang Ji; Bee Wah Lee; Lynette P Shek; Hugo Ps Van Bever; Patrick Detzel; Economic value of using partially hydrolysed infant formula for risk reduction of atopic dermatitis in high-risk, not exclusively breastfed infants in Singapore, Singapore Med J, 2017 Oct 06; ():0037-5675",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exclusive use of partially hydrolysed 100% whey-based (PHF-W) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard cow’s milk formula (CMF),"Healthy, non-exclusively breastfed, high-risk infants (i.e. those with a parent or sibling with an allergic disease history) of atopic dermatitis",18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Months,3.00,3.00,-24454.55,Singapore,2013,-21719.4
18615,An economic evaluation of Alexander Technique lessons or acupuncture sessions for patients with chronic neck pain: A randomized trial (ATLAS),"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture and usual care, and Alexander Technique lessons and usual care, compared with usual GP care alone for chronic neck pain patients. METHODS: An economic evaluation was undertaken alongside the ATLAS trial, taking both NHS and wider societal viewpoints. Participants were offered up to twelve acupuncture sessions or twenty Alexander lessons (equivalent overall contact time). Costs were in pounds sterling. Effectiveness was measured using the generic EQ-5D to calculate quality adjusted life years (QALYs), as well as using a specific neck pain measure-the Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire (NPQ). RESULTS: In the base case analysis, incremental QALY gains were 0.032 and 0.025 in the acupuncture and Alexander groups, respectively, in comparison to usual GP care, indicating moderate health benefits for both interventions. Incremental costs were pound451 for acupuncture and pound667 for Alexander, mainly driven by intervention costs. Acupuncture was likely to be cost-effective (ICER = pound18,767/QALY bootstrapped 95% CI pound4,426 to pound74,562) and was robust to most sensitivity analyses. Alexander lessons were not cost-effective at the lower NICE threshold of pound20,000/QALY ( pound25,101/QALY bootstrapped 95% CI - pound150,208 to pound248,697) but may be at pound30,000/QALY, however, there was considerable statistical uncertainty in all tested scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with usual care, acupuncture is likely to be cost-effective for chronic neck pain, whereas, largely due to higher intervention costs, Alexander lessons are unlikely to be cost-effective.

18617,Adjuvant Statin Therapy for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Emerging preclinical evidence indicates statins, medications commonly used in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), inhibit proliferation, promote apoptosis and limit invasiveness of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Population-based observational data demonstrate statin treatment after diagnosis of EAC is associated with significant reductions in all-cause and cancer-specific mortality. A feasibility study of adjuvant statin therapy following potentially curative resection for EAC has been completed, with planned progression to a full phase III, randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to estimate the cost-utility of statin therapy following surgical resection for EAC from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes [quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] for hypothetical cohorts of patients with EAC exposed or not exposed to statins following potentially curative surgical resection. Model parameters were based on estimates from published observational and trial data. Costs, utilities and transition probabilities were modeled to reflect clinical practice from a payer''s perspective. Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty in key parameters. RESULTS: Overall, a cost saving of pound6781 per patient was realized with statin treatment compared to no statins. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99% of all iterations were cost saving and 99% of all iterations were less than pound20,000 per QALY gained. These results were robust to changes in the price and effectiveness of statins. CONCLUSIONS: The cohort exposed to statins had lower costs and better QALY outcomes than the no statin cohort. Assuming a causal improvement in disease outcomes following resection for EAC, statin therapy is very likely to be a cost-saving treatment.",2017-01-25792,29210031,Pharmacoeconomics,Rebekah Fong Soe Khioe,2017,/,,Yes,29210031,"Rebekah Fong Soe Khioe; Chris Skedgel; Andrew Hart; Michael Philip Nelson Lewis; Leo Alexandre; Adjuvant Statin Therapy for Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: A Cost-Utility Analysis, Pharmacoeconomics, 2017 Mar 24; ():1179-2027",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Statin therapy vs. No statin therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-4036.31,United Kingdom,2016,-5899.95
18618,Economic Evaluation and Budget Impact Analysis of Vaccination against Haemophilus influenzae Type b Infection in Thailand,"Current study aimed to estimate clinical and economic outcomes of providing the Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination as a national vaccine immunization program in Thailand. A decision tree combined with Markov model was developed to simulate relevant costs and health outcomes covering lifetime horizon in societal and health care payer perspectives. This analysis considered children aged under 5 years old whom preventive vaccine of Hib infection are indicated. Two combined Hib vaccination schedules were considered: three-dose series (3 + 0) and three-dose series plus a booster does (3 + 1) compared with no vaccination. Budget impact analysis was also performed under Thai government perspective. The outcomes were reported as Hib-infected cases averted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2014 Thai baht (THB) ($) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. In base-case scenario, the model estimates that 3,960 infected cases, 59 disability cases, and 97 deaths can be prevented by national Hib vaccination program. The ICER for 3 + 0 schedule was THB 1,099 ($34) per QALY gained under societal perspective. The model was sensitive to pneumonia incidence among aged under 5 years old and direct non-medical care cost per episode of Hib pneumonia. Hib vaccination is very cost-effective in the Thai context. The budget impact analysis showed that Thai government needed to invest an additional budget of 110 ($3.4) million to implement Hib vaccination program.

18619,The Cost-Effectiveness of Lowering Permissible Noise Levels Around U.S. Airports,"Aircraft noise increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and mental illness. The allowable limit for sound in the vicinity of an airport is 65 decibels (dB) averaged over a 24-h ''day and night'' period (DNL) in the United States. We evaluate the trade-off between the cost and the health benefits of changing the regulatory DNL level from 65 dB to 55 dB using a Markov model. The study used LaGuardia Airport (LGA) as a case study. In compliance with 55 dB allowable limit of aircraft noise, sound insulation would be required for residential homes within the 55 dB to 65 dB DNL. A Markov model was built to assess the cost-effectiveness of installing sound insulation. One-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation were conducted to test uncertainty of the model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of installing sound insulation for residents exposed to airplane noise from LGA was $11,163/QALY gained (95% credible interval: cost-saving and life-saving to $93,054/QALY gained).

This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of NHSP for CKD in Korea. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was constructed to compare CKD screening strategies of the NHSP with no screening. We developed a model that simulated disease progression in a cohort aged 20 to 120 years or death from the societal perspective. RESULTS: Biannual screening starting at age 40 for CKD by proteinuria (dipstick) and estimated glomerular filtration ratio had an ICUR of $66,874/QALY relative to no screening.

18638,Cost-effectiveness of yoga for managing musculoskeletal conditions in the workplace,"Background: Back pain and musculoskeletal conditions negatively affect the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of employees and generate substantial costs to employers. Aims: To assess the cost-effectiveness of yoga for managing musculoskeletal conditions. Methods: A randomized controlled trial evaluated an 8-week yoga programme, with a 6-month follow-up, for National Health Service (NHS) employees. Effectiveness in managing musculoskeletal conditions was assessed using repeated-measures generalized linear modelling for the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RDQ) and the Keele STarT Back Screening Tool. Cost-effectiveness was determined using area-under-the-curve linear regression for assessing HRQL from healthcare and societal perspectives. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was also calculated. Sickness absence was measured using electronic staff records at 6 months. Results: There were 151 participants. At 6 months, mean differences between groups favouring yoga were observed for RDQ [-0.63 (95% CI, -1.78, 0.48)], Keele STarT [-0.28 (95% CI, -0.97, 0.07)] and HRQL (0.016 QALY gain). From a healthcare perspective, yoga yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound2103 per QALY. Given a willingness to pay for an additional QALY of pound20 000, the probability of yoga being cost-effective was 95%. From a societal perspective, yoga was the dominant treatment compared with usual care. At 6 months, electronic staff records showed that yoga participants missed a total of 2 working days due to musculoskeletal conditions compared with 43 days for usual care participants.

18640,Cost Utility Analysis of Cervical Therapeutic Medial Branch Blocks in Managing Chronic Neck Pain,"Background: Controlled diagnostic studies have established the prevalence of cervical facet joint pain to range from 36% to 67% based on the criterion standard of >/= 80% pain relief. Treatment of cervical facet joint pain has been described with Level II evidence of effectiveness for therapeutic facet joint nerve blocks and radiofrequency neurotomy and with no significant evidence for intraarticular injections. However, there have not been any cost effectiveness or cost utility analysis studies performed in managing chronic neck pain with or without headaches with cervical facet joint interventions. Study Design: Cost utility analysis based on the results of a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of cervical therapeutic medial branch blocks in managing chronic neck pain. Objectives: To assess cost utility of therapeutic cervical medial branch blocks in managing chronic neck pain. Methods: A randomized trial was conducted in a specialty referral private practice interventional pain management center in the United States. This trial assessed the clinical effectiveness of therapeutic cervical medial branch blocks with or without steroids for an established diagnosis of cervical facet joint pain by means of controlled diagnostic blocks. Cost utility analysis was performed with direct payment data for the procedures for a total of 120 patients over a period of 2 years from this trial based on reimbursement rates of 2016. The payment data provided direct procedural costs without inclusion of drug treatments. An additional 40% was added to procedural costs with multiplication of a factor of 1.67 to provide estimated total costs including direct and indirect costs, based on highly regarded surgical literature. Outcome measures included significant improvement defined as at least a 50% improvement with reduction in pain and disability status with a combined 50% or more reduction in pain in Neck Disability Index (NDI) scores. Results: The results showed direct procedural costs per one-year improvement in quality adjusted life year (QALY) of United States Dollar (USD) of $2,552, and overall costs of USD $4,261. Overall, each patient on average received 5.7 +/- 2.2 procedures over a period of 2 years. Average significant improvement per procedure was 15.6 +/- 12.3 weeks and average significant improvement in 2 years per patient was 86.0 +/- 24.6 weeks. Limitations: The limitations of this cost utility analysis are that data are based on a single center evaluation. Only costs of therapeutic interventional procedures and physician visits were included, with extrapolation of indirect costs. Conclusion: The cost utility analysis of therapeutic cervical medial branch blocks in the treatment of chronic neck pain non-responsive to conservative management demonstrated clinical effectiveness and cost utility at USD $4,261 per one year of QALY.",2017-01-25807,29200944,Int J Med Sci,Laxmaiah Manchikanti,2017,14 / 13,1307-1316,No,29200944,"Laxmaiah Manchikanti; Vidyasagar Pampati; Alan D Kaye; Joshua A Hirsch; Cost Utility Analysis of Cervical Therapeutic Medial Branch Blocks in Managing Chronic Neck Pain, Int J Med Sci, 2017; 14(13):1449-1907; 1307-1316",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bupivacaine vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,4261.25,United States,2016,4595.11
18641,Value Of Waiving Coinsurance For Colorectal Cancer Screening In Medicare Beneficiaries,"Financial barriers to colorectal cancer screening persist despite the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Medicare beneficiaries may face 20 percent coinsurance for a screening colonoscopy when the procedure includes the removal of polyps or follows a positive fecal screening test. Using an established microsimulation model, we estimated that waiving this coinsurance would result in 1.7 fewer colorectal cancer deaths (a decrease of 13 percent) and $17,000 higher colorectal cancer-related costs (an increase of 0.6 percent) for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services per 1,000 sixty-five-year-olds, assuming a 10-percentage-point increase in the rates of first colonoscopy screening, follow-up, and surveillance. If the rates did not change, waiving coinsurance would increase total costs by $51,000 (1.9 percent) per 1,000 sixty-five-year-olds. Estimated screening benefits were comparable when fecal testing was assumed to be the primary screening method. Moreover, waiving coinsurance would be cost-effective if the screening rate increased by 0.6 percentage points, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

18643,Cost-effectiveness of cognitive therapy as an early intervention for post-traumatic stress disorder in children and adolescents: a trial based evaluation and model,"BACKGROUND: Untreated post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in children and adolescents is associated with a considerable economic burden on the health system, families and society. Recent research has demonstrated the potential efficacy of cognitive therapy as an early intervention for PTSD in children and adolescents. Children who experienced a single traumatic event in the previous two to six months and were randomized to cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD) were significantly more likely to be PTSD-free compared to those randomized to usual care represented by waitlist control. The current study evaluated the economic impact of improvements in the treatment of PTSD in children and adolescents. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from the national health service/personal social services perspective with outcomes expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Patient level costs and outcomes were collected during the 11 week clinical trial and extrapolated to a three year time horizon using economic modelling methods. Uncertainty was estimated using probabilistic sensitivity analysis and assumptions were tested using one way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at 3 years was pound2,205 per QALY with a 60%-69% probability of CT-PTSD being cost-effective compared to usual care at the UK pound20,000 to pound30,000 per QALY decision threshold.

18649,Management of Reducible Ventral Hernias: Clinical Outcomes and Cost-effectiveness of Repair at Diagnosis Versus Watchful Waiting,"OBJECTIVE: To compare long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with 3 management strategies for reducible ventral hernia: repair at diagnosis (open or laparoscopic) and watchful waiting. BACKGROUND: There is variability in ventral hernia management. Recent data suggest watchful waiting is safe; however, long-term clinical and economic outcomes for different management strategies remain unknown. METHODS: We built a state-transition microsimulation model to forecast outcomes for individuals with reducible ventral hernia, simulating a cohort of 1 million individuals for each strategy. We derived cohort characteristics (mean age 58 years, 63% female), hospital costs, and perioperative mortality from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003-2011), and additional probabilities, costs, and utilities from the literature. Outcomes included prevalence of any repair, emergent repair, and recurrence; lifetime costs; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. We performed stochastic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to identify parameter thresholds that affect optimal management, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY. RESULTS: With watchful waiting, 39% ultimately required repair (14% emergent) and 24% recurred. Seventy per cent recurred with repair at diagnosis. Laparoscopic repair at diagnosis was cost-effective compared with open repair at diagnosis (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $27,700/QALY). The choice of operative strategy (open vs laparoscopic) was sensitive to cost and postoperative quality of life. When perioperative mortality exceeded 5.2% or yearly recurrence exceeded 19.2%, watchful waiting became preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Ventral hernia repair at diagnosis is very cost-effective.

Outcomes included prevalence of any repair, emergent repair, and recurrence; lifetime costs; quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. We performed stochastic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to identify parameter thresholds that affect optimal management, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY. RESULTS: With watchful waiting, 39% ultimately required repair (14% emergent) and 24% recurred. Seventy per cent recurred with repair at diagnosis. Laparoscopic repair at diagnosis was cost-effective compared with open repair at diagnosis (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $27,700/QALY). The choice of operative strategy (open vs laparoscopic) was sensitive to cost and postoperative quality of life. When perioperative mortality exceeded 5.2% or yearly recurrence exceeded 19.2%, watchful waiting became preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Ventral hernia repair at diagnosis is very cost-effective. The choice between open and laparoscopic repair depends on surgical costs and postoperative quality of life. In patients with high risk of perioperative mortality or recurrence, watchful waiting is preferred.",2017-01-25814,29194083,Ann Surg,Lindsey L Wolf,2017,/,,No,29194083,"Lindsey L Wolf; Julius I Ejiofor; Ye Wang; Myriam G Hunink; Elena Losina; Adil H Haider; Douglas S Smink; Management of Reducible Ventral Hernias: Clinical Outcomes and Cost-effectiveness of Repair at Diagnosis Versus Watchful Waiting, Ann Surg, 2017 Jun 27; ():0003-4932",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic surgical repair at ventral hernia diagnosis vs. Open surgical repair at ventral hernia diagnosis,Not Stated,Not Stated,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,27667,United States,2015,30211.01
18653,Evaluation of an integrated primary care-led dementia shared care program in Singapore: An effectiveness and cost-effectiveness study,"AIM: With an aging Singapore population, there is an increasing demand for dementia care. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Primary Care Dementia Clinic (PCDC) in comparison with the Memory Clinic (MC; hospital-based) and other polyclinics. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was implemented. Effectiveness of PCDC was assessed through caregiver satisfaction, quality of life (caregiver-rated) and adverse events rates. Quality-of-Life measures using the EuroQol 5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D) at baseline, 6 months and 12 months was assessed. Costs were calculated from a societal perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the PCDC was compared with MC and other polyclinics. RESULTS: The present study showed that quality of life and the rate of adverse events at 12 months were similar between the three groups. Caregiver satisfaction at 12 months was higher in the PCDC group when compared with other polyclinics. There were no observed differences in societal cost between the three groups. At 6-month follow up, direct medical costs for PCDC were significantly lower that of other polyclinics. At 12-month follow up, PCDC patients had higher Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) compared with the MC group. CONCLUSION: PCDC provided effective care, similar to care at MC and better than care at other polyclinics. Caregiver satisfaction was higher for the PCDC group, and PCDC patients had lower direct medical costs at 6-month follow up. Given these findings, adopting a PCDC model in other polyclinics in Singapore can be beneficial for optimal right siting of patients.

18657,Modelling the effects of quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Puerto Rico,"BACKGROUND: No study has estimated the potential impact of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Puerto Rico, a population with considerable burden of HPV-related morbidities. We evaluated the health and economic impacts of implementing a vaccination strategy for females and males in Puerto Rico, with the quadrivalent HPV (HPV4) vaccine, under different vaccination scenarios. METHODS: We adapted a mathematical model which estimates the direct and indirect health benefits and costs of HPV4 vaccination in a dynamic population. The model compared three vaccination scenarios against screening only (no-vaccination) for three doses of HPV4 vaccine among individuals aged 11-15 years in Puerto Rico: 1) 34% for females and 13% for males (34%F/13%M), 2) 50% for females and 40% for males (50%F/40%M), and 3) 80% for female and 64% for male (80%F/64%M). Data specific to Puerto Rico was used. When not available, values from the United States were used. Input data consisted of demographic, behavioral, epidemiological, screening, and economic parameters. RESULTS: The model predicted decreases in: 1) HPV infection prevalence for females and males, 2) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer incidence for females, 3) genital warts incidence for females and males, and 4) cervical cancer deaths among females, when various vaccination program scenarios were considered. In addition, when the vaccination percentage was increased in every scenario, the reduction was greater and began earlier. The analysis also evidenced an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $1,964 per quality-adjusted life year gained for the 80%F/64%M uptake scenario.

18676,Cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan in chronic heart-failure patients with reduced ejection fraction,"AIMS: We aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan compared to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) for the treatment of individuals with chronic heart failure and reduced-ejection fraction (HFrEF) from the perspective of the Swiss health care system. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness analysis was implemented as a lifelong regression-based cohort model. We compared sacubitril/valsartan with enalapril in chronic heart failure patients with HFrEF and New York-Heart Association Functional Classification II-IV symptoms. Regression models based on the randomised clinical phase III PARADIGM-HF trials were used to predict events (all-cause mortality, hospitalisations, adverse events and quality of life) for each treatment strategy modelled over the lifetime horizon, with adjustments for patient characteristics. Unit costs were obtained from Swiss public sources for the year 2014, and costs and effects were discounted by 3%. The main outcome of interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) and scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were performed. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the sacubitril/valsartan strategy showed a decrease in the number of hospitalisations (6.0% per year absolute reduction) and lifetime hospital costs by 8.0% (discounted) when compared with enalapril. Sacubitril/valsartan was predicted to improve overall and quality-adjusted survival by 0.50 years and 0.42 QALYs, respectively. Additional net-total costs were CHF 10 926. This led to an ICER of CHF 25 684. In PSA, the probability of sacubitril/valsartan being cost-effective at thresholds of CHF 50 000 was 99.0%. CONCLUSION: The treatment of HFrEF patients with sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril is cost effective, if a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF 50 000 per QALY gained ratio is assumed.",2017-01-25822,29185253,Swiss Med Wkly,Zanfina Ademi,2017,147 /,w14533,No,29185253,"Zanfina Ademi; Alena M Pfeil; Elizabeth Hancock; David Trueman; Rola Haroun Haroun; Celine Deschaseaux; Matthias Schwenkglenks; Cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan in chronic heart-failure patients with reduced ejection fraction, Swiss Med Wkly, 2017 Nov 29; 147():1424-7860; w14533",QALY,Switzerland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sacubitril/valsartan and standard care vs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,38127.06,Switzerland,2014,45625.09
18677,Comparative effectiveness of incorporating a hypothetical DCIS prognostic marker into breast cancer screening,"PURPOSE: Due to limitations in the ability to identify non-progressive disease, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is usually managed similarly to localized invasive breast cancer. We used simulation modeling to evaluate the potential impact of a hypothetical test that identifies non-progressive DCIS. METHODS: A discrete-event model simulated a cohort of U.S. women undergoing digital screening mammography. All women diagnosed with DCIS underwent the hypothetical DCIS prognostic test. Women with test results indicating progressive DCIS received standard breast cancer treatment and a decrement to quality of life corresponding to the treatment. If the DCIS test indicated non-progressive DCIS, no treatment was received and women continued routine annual surveillance mammography. A range of test performance characteristics and prevalence of non-progressive disease were simulated. Analysis compared discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs for test scenarios to base-case scenarios without the test. RESULTS: Compared to the base case, a perfect prognostic test resulted in a 40% decrease in treatment costs, from $13,321 to $8005 USD per DCIS case. A perfect test produced 0.04 additional QALYs (16 days) for women diagnosed with DCIS, added to the base case of 5.88 QALYs per DCIS case. The results were sensitive to the performance characteristics of the prognostic test, the proportion of DCIS cases that were non-progressive in the model, and the frequency of mammography screening in the population. CONCLUSION: A prognostic test that identifies non-progressive DCIS would substantially reduce treatment costs but result in only modest improvements in quality of life when averaged over all DCIS cases.",2017-01-25823,29185118,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Amy Trentham-Dietz,2017,/,,No,29185118,"Amy Trentham-Dietz; Mehmet Ali Ergun; Oguzhan Alagoz; Natasha K Stout; Ronald E Gangnon; John M Hampton; Kim Dittus; Ted A James; Pamela M Vacek; Sally D Herschorn; Elizabeth S Burnside; Anna N A Tosteson; Donald L Weaver; Brian L Sprague; Comparative effectiveness of incorporating a hypothetical DCIS prognostic marker into breast cancer screening, Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2017 May 11; ():0167-6806",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Perfect prognostic test for non-progressive ductal carcinoma in situ vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard breast cancer screening, no extra test",Not Stated,100 Years,20 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-120818.18,United States,2015,-131927.56
18678,Health economic evaluation of rivaroxaban in elective cardioversion of atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Electrical cardioversion (ECV) is a procedure in which a direct current electric shock is used to quickly and effectively restore the normal sinus rhythm. Appropriate anticoagulation reduces the risk of embolic events during and after ECV. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with vitamin K oral antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing elective ECV in the Netherlands. METHODS AND RESULTS: A static transmission model over a 1-year time horizon was developed to compare rivaroxaban with VKAs in terms of clinical outcomes, health effects (quality-adjusted life years; QALYs), and costs. Cost-effectiveness was assessed from a societal and health care payer perspective at a willingness-to-pay level of euro20,000 per QALY gained. The use of rivaroxaban as an anticoagulant in patients with atrial fibrillation scheduled for ECV would lead to a health gain of 0.23 QALYs per patient and would cost euro1.83 per patient from the societal perspective, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro7.92 per QALY gained. The probability of rivaroxaban being cost-saving compared with VKAs was 49.6% from this perspective. From the health care payer perspective, the incremental cost would be euro509 per patient with a health gain of 0.23 QALYs per patient, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2198 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The use of rivaroxaban in elective ECV is a cost-effective alternative to the use of VKAs. Rivaroxaban has a 50% probability of being cost-saving compared with VKAs and would increase a patient''s quality of life when non-health care costs such as productivity loss and informal care costs are taken into account.",2017-01-25827,29181817,Eur J Health Econ,Maartje S Jacobs,2017,/,,Yes,29181817,"Maartje S Jacobs; Lisa A de Jong; Maarten J Postma; Robert G Tieleman; Marinus van Hulst; Health economic evaluation of rivaroxaban in elective cardioversion of atrial fibrillation, Eur J Health Econ, 2017 Apr 05; ():1618-7598",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rivaroxaban vs. Vitamin K oral antagonist,Undergoing elective electrical cardioversion,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,7.92,Euro,2015,9.6
18679,Cost-effectiveness analysis of patient self-testing therapy of oral anticoagulation,"Patient Self-testing (PST) could be an option for present anticoagulation therapy monitoring, but current evidence on its cost-effectiveness is limited. This study aims to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PST to other different care approaches for anticoagulation therapy in Thailand, a low-to-middle income country (LMIC). A Markov model was used to compare lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued to patients receiving warfarin through PST or either anticoagulation clinic (AC) or usual care (UC). The model was populated with relevant information from literature, network meta-analysis, and database analyses. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were presented as the year 2015 values. A base-case analysis was performed for patients at age 45-year-old. Sensitivity analyses including one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were constructed to determine the robustness of the findings. From societal perspective, PST increased QALY by 0.87 and costs by 112,461 THB compared with UC. Compared with AC, PST increased QALY by 0.161 and costs by 21,019 THB. The ICER with PST was 128,697 (3625 USD) and 130,493 THB (3676 USD) per QALY gained compared with UC and AC, respectively. The probability of PST being cost-effective is 74.1% and 51.9%, compared to UC and AC, respectively, in Thai context. Results were sensitive to the efficacy of PST, age and frequency of hospital visit or self-testing. This analysis suggested that PST is highly cost-effective compared with usual care and less cost-effective against anticoagulation clinic.

A Markov model was used to compare lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued to patients receiving warfarin through PST or either anticoagulation clinic (AC) or usual care (UC). The model was populated with relevant information from literature, network meta-analysis, and database analyses. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were presented as the year 2015 values. A base-case analysis was performed for patients at age 45-year-old. Sensitivity analyses including one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were constructed to determine the robustness of the findings. From societal perspective, PST increased QALY by 0.87 and costs by 112,461 THB compared with UC. Compared with AC, PST increased QALY by 0.161 and costs by 21,019 THB. The ICER with PST was 128,697 (3625 USD) and 130,493 THB (3676 USD) per QALY gained compared with UC and AC, respectively. The probability of PST being cost-effective is 74.1% and 51.9%, compared to UC and AC, respectively, in Thai context. Results were sensitive to the efficacy of PST, age and frequency of hospital visit or self-testing. This analysis suggested that PST is highly cost-effective compared with usual care and less cost-effective against anticoagulation clinic.

18681,Cost-effectiveness of a preferred intensity exercise programme for young people with depression compared with treatment as usual: an economic evaluation alongside a clinical trial in the UK,OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of preferred intensity exercise programme for young people with depression compared with a treatment as usual control group. DESIGN: A ''within trial'' cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. The perspective of the analysis was the UK National Health Service and social services. SETTING: The intervention was provided in a community leisure centre setting. PARTICIPANTS: 86 young people aged 14-17 years attending Tier 2 and Tier 3 CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services) outpatient services presenting with depression. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention comprised 12 separate sessions of circuit training over a 6-week period. Sessions were supervised by a qualified exercise therapist. Participants also received treatment as usual. The comparator group received treatment as usual. RESULTS: We found improvements in the Children''s Depression Inventory-2 (CDI-2) and estimated cost-effectiveness at pound61 per point improvement in CDI-2 for the exercise group compared with control. We found no evidence that the exercise intervention led to differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALY). QALYs were estimated using the EQ-5D-5L (5-level version of EuroQol-5 dimension).

18683,Cost-effectiveness analysis of fecal microbiota transplantation for inflammatory bowel disease,"There is a lack of health economics evidence on the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness before (with conventional therapy) and after introducing FMT for treating IBD. 104 patients with IBD received FMT were recruited. Health status was evaluated by European dimension health table (ED-5Q). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net monetary benefit (NB) were calculated by different age groups, genders, smoking status, and disease subtypes. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set to the value equal to three times China''s per capita GDP (141240 CNY/QALY, 2014). From the health-care perspective, FMT strategy was 73% likely to be cost-effective compared with the conventional therapy before FMT with an ICER of -185712 CNY/QALY and a positive NB of CNY 45150. From the societal perspective, FMT strategy was 75% likely to be cost-effective with an ICER of -207417 CNY/QALY and a positive NB of CNY 48395. Moreover, younger patients (</= 24), females, non-smokers and Crohn''s disease (CD) achieved more benefits. This study for the first time demonstrated that FMT showed its cost-effectiveness, especially on improving the life quality and decreasing the medical and societal cost, for the moderate to severe IBD in a Chinese cohort.",2017-01-25832,29179485,Oncotarget,Ting Zhang,2017,8 / 51,88894-88903,No,29179485,"Ting Zhang; Jie Xiang; Bota Cui; Zhi He; Pan Li; Hai Chen; Lijuan Xu; Guozhong Ji; Yongzhan Nie; Kaichun Wu; Daiming Fan; Guangming Huang; Jianling Bai; Faming Zhang; Cost-effectiveness analysis of fecal microbiota transplantation for inflammatory bowel disease, Oncotarget, 2017 Oct 24; 8(51):1949-2553; 88894-88903",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fecal microbiota transplant vs. Standard/Usual Care- Conventional therapy( Pre-Fecal Microbiota Transplantation),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-207417,China,2015,-36049.39
18684,Results of the First Steps study: a randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation of the Group Family Nurse Partnership (gFNP) programme compared with usual care in improving outcomes for high-risk mothers and their children and preventing abuse,"BACKGROUND: Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) is a home-based nurse home-visiting programme to support vulnerable parents. Group Family Nurse Partnership (gFNP) has similar aims and materials and was demonstrated to be feasible in implementation evaluations. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether or not gFNP, compared with usual care, could reduce risk factors for maltreatment in a vulnerable group and be cost-effective. DESIGN: A multisite randomised controlled parallel-group trial and prospective economic evaluation, with eligible women allocated (minimised by site and maternal age group) to gFNP or usual care. SETTING: Community locations in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Expectant mothers aged < 20 years with one or more previous live births, or expectant mothers aged 20-24 years with no previous live births and with low educational qualifications (defined as General Certificate of Education at grade C or higher in neither mathematics nor English language or, if they had both, no more than four General Certificates of Education at grade C or higher). INTERVENTION: Forty-four sessions of gFNP (14 during pregnancy and 30 in the first 12 months after birth) were offered to groups of between 8 and 12 women with similar expected delivery dates (the difference between the earliest and latest expected delivery date ranged from 8 to 10 weeks depending on the group) by two family nurses (FNs), one of whom had notified her intention to practise as a midwife. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Parenting was assessed by a self-report measure of parenting opinions, the Adult Adolescent Parenting Inventory Version 2 (AAPI-2), and an objective measure of maternal sensitivity, the CARE-Index. Cost-effectiveness was primarily expressed in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. DATA SOURCES: Interviews with participants at baseline and when infants were aged 2, 6 and 12 months. Cost information from nurse weekly logs and other service delivery data. RESULTS: In total, 166 women were enrolled (99 to the intervention group and 67 to the control group). Adjusting for site and maternal age group, the intention-to-treat analysis found no effect of gFNP on either of the primary outcomes. AAPI-2 total was 7.5/10 [standard error (SE) 0.1] in both arms [difference also adjusted for baseline 0.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.28; p = 0.50]. CARE-Index maternal sensitivity mean: intervention 4.0 (SE 0.3); control 4.7 (SE 0.4) (difference -0.76, 95% CI -1.67 to 0.13; p = 0.21). The sensitivity analyses supported the primary analyses. The probability that the gFNP intervention was cost-effective based on the QALY measure did not exceed 3%. However, in terms of change in AAPI-2 score (baseline to 12 months), the probability that gFNP was cost-effective reached 25.1%. A separate discrete choice experiment highlighted the value placed by both pregnant women and members of the general population on non-health outcomes that were not included in the QALY metric. LIMITATIONS: Slow recruitment resulted in smaller than ideal group sizes. In some cases, few or no sessions took place owing to low initial group size, and small groups may have contributed to attrition from the intervention. Exposure to gFNP sessions was below maximum for most group members, with only 58 of the 97 intervention participants receiving any sessions; FNs were experienced with FNP but were mainly new to delivering gFNP. CONCLUSIONS: The trial does not support the delivery of gFNP as a means of reducing the risk of child abuse or neglect in this population. FUTURE WORK: A randomised controlled trial with modified eligibility to enable first-time mothers aged < 20 years to be included, and a modified recruitment strategy to enable faster identification of potential participants from antenatal medical records.

18685,Time Gain Needed for In-Ambulance Telemedicine: Cost-Utility Model,"BACKGROUND: Stroke is a very time-sensitive pathology, and many new solutions target the optimization of prehospital stroke care to improve the stroke management process. In-ambulance telemedicine, defined by live bidirectional audio-video between a patient and a neurologist in a moving ambulance and the automated transfer of vital parameters, is a promising new approach to speed up and improve the quality of acute stroke care. Currently, no evidence exists on the cost effectiveness of in-ambulance telemedicine. OBJECTIVE: We aim to develop a first cost effectiveness model for in-ambulance telemedicine and use this model to estimate the time savings needed before in-ambulance telemedicine becomes cost effective. METHODS: Current standard stroke care is compared with current standard stroke care supplemented with in-ambulance telemedicine using a cost-utility model measuring costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from a health care perspective. We combine a decision tree with a Markov model. Data from the UZ Brussel Stroke Registry (2282 stroke patients) and linked hospital claims data at individual level are combined with literature data to populate the model. A 2-way sensitivity analysis varying both implementation costs and time gain is performed to map the different cost-effective combinations and identify the time gain needed for cost effectiveness and dominance. For several modeled time gains, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve is calculated and mapped in 1 figure. RESULTS: Under the base-case scenario (implementation cost of US $159,425) and taking a lifetime horizon into account, in-ambulance telemedicine is a cost-effective strategy compared to standard stroke care alone starting from a time gain of 6 minutes. After 12 minutes, in-ambulance telemedicine becomes dominant, and this results in a mean decrease of costs by US -$30 (95% CI -$32 to -$29) per patient with 0.00456 (95% CI 0.00448 to 0.00463) QALYs on average gained per patient. In over 82% of all probabilistic simulations, in-ambulance telemedicine remains under the cost-effectiveness threshold of US $47,747. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that in-ambulance telemedicine can be cost effective starting from a time gain of 6 minutes and becomes a dominant strategy after approximately 15 minutes. This indicates that in-ambulance telemedicine has the potential to become a cost-effective intervention assuming time gains in clinical implementations are realized in the future.",2017-01-25840,29175808,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,Alexis Valenzuela Espinoza,2017,5 / 11,e175,No,29175808,"Alexis Valenzuela Espinoza; Stefanie Devos; Robbert-Jan van Hooff; Maaike Fobelets; Alain Dupont; Maarten Moens; Ives Hubloue; Door Lauwaert; Pieter Cornu; Raf Brouns; Koen Putman; Time Gain Needed for In-Ambulance Telemedicine: Cost-Utility Model, JMIR Mhealth Uhealth, 2017 Nov 24; 5(11):2291-5222; e175",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Current standard stroke care supplemented with in-ambulance telemedicine vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard stroke care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 3 months",3.00,1.50,219475,United States,2014,239940.46
18686,Cost effectiveness evaluation of hepatitis C therapy in Lahore,"Approximately 10 million Pakistan''s of population is a victim of Hepatitis C virus. A comparative study of two treatments for Hepatitis C being provided in private clinics and government hospitals was conducted to evaluate the cost effectiveness of these treatments. The quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for each treatment plan was determined with the help of health utilities, using EQ-5D scores. A comprehensive data collection form aided in scrutinizing the cause and effect of each treatment on the patient''s quality of life. The total sample size for this study is 200 total from the public and private sectors. For both the treatment strategies, values for quality adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost effective ratio (ICER) and cost effective analysis (CEA) were calculated. The Hepatitis C virus 3a and 3b genotypic patients who were treated with pegylated interferon alpha-2a and ribavirin combination (strategy 2) showed an increased quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of two years, as compared to those who received interferon alpha-2a and ribavirin regimen (strategy 1). An incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Rs 144673.5 per quality adjusted life year (QALYs) was gained by patients treated with strategy 2. The therapy followed by the government sector (strategy 1) is relatively inexpensive accounting for Rs 654.5/quality adjusted life years (QALY) and therapy provided at the clinic sector (strategy 2) is relatively expensive Rs 5620.6/ quality adjusted life years (QALY).

18687,Cost-effectiveness of Paclitaxel + Ramucirumab Combination Therapy for Advanced Gastric Cancer Progressing After First-line Chemotherapy in Japan,"PURPOSE: The combination of paclitaxel + ramucirumab is a standard second-line treatment in patients with advanced gastric cancer. This therapy has been associated with increased median overall survival and progression-free survival compared with those with paclitaxel monotherapy. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of paclitaxel + ramucirumab combination therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer, from the perspective of health care payers in Japan. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to compare, over a time horizon of 3 years, the costs and effectiveness of the combination of paclitaxel + ramucirumab and paclitaxel alone as second-line therapies for advanced gastric cancer in Japan. Health outcomes were measured in life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted (QA) LYs gained. Costs were calculated using year-2016 Japanese yen ( yen1 = US $17.79) according to the social insurance reimbursement schedule and drug tariff of the fee-for-service system in Japan. Model robustness was addressed through 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 2% per year. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at the World Health Organization''s criterion of yen12 million, because no consensus exists regarding the threshold for acceptable cost per QALY ratios in Japan''s health policy. FINDINGS: Paclitaxel + ramucirumab combination therapy was estimated to provide an additional 0.09 QALYs (0.10 LYs) at a cost of yen3,870,077, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of yen43,010,248/QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the combination therapy was > yen12 million/QALY in all of the 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. IMPLICATIONS: Adding ramucirumab to a regimen of paclitaxel in the second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer is expected to provide a minimal incremental benefit at a high incremental cost per QALY.

18688,Cost-effectiveness analysis of different types of human papillomavirus vaccination combined with a cervical cancer screening program in mainland China,"BACKGROUND: China has a high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and a consequently high burden of disease with respect to cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine has proved to be effective in preventing cervical cancer and is now a part of routine immunization programs worldwide. It has also proved to be cost effective. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of 2-, 4-, and 9-valent HPV vaccines (hereafter, HPV2, 4 or 9) combined with current screening strategies in China. METHODS: A Markov model was developed for a cohort of 100,000 HPV-free girls to simulate the natural history to HPV infection. Three recommended screening methods (1. liquid-based cytology test + HPV DNA test; 2. pap smear cytology test + HPV DNA test; 3. visual inspection with acetic acid) and three types of HPV vaccination program (HPV2/4/9) were incorporated into 15 intervention options, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to determine the dominant strategies. Costs, transition probabilities and utilities were obtained from a review of the literature and national databases. One-way sensitivity analyses and threshold analyses were performed for key variables in different vaccination scenarios. RESULTS: HPV9 combined with screening showed the highest health impact in terms of reducing HPV-related diseases and increasing the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Under the current thresholds of willingness to pay (WTP, 3 times the per capita GDP or USD$ 23,880), HPV4/9 proved highly cost effective, while HPV2 combined with screening cost more and was less cost effective.

18691,Cost-effectiveness of teriparatide compared with alendronate and risedronate for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis patients in Iran,"Background: Hip, vertebral and wrist fractures are the most common consequences of osteoporosis. This study aimed at analyzing the cost-effectiveness of teriparatide (CinnoPar(R)), compared with alendronate and risedronate, in the treatment of women aged 60 and over with postmenopausal osteoporosis in Iran. Methods: A decision tree model with a 2-year time horizon was used to compare treatment with teriparatide (CinnoPar(R)) with the following treatment strategies: two years of treatment with alendronate and two years of treatment with risedronate in women aged 60 years and over or those at risk of osteoporosis. Cost per QALY was calculated for 3 treatment strategies from the model. After base case analysis, one-way sensitivity analysis was performed on key parameters of the model to assess their impact on the study results and the cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies and the model robustness. TreeAge Pro 2006 software was used for modeling and data analysis. Results: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of alendronate and teriparatide than risedronate (base treatment) were US$- 2178.03 and US$483,783.67 per QALY, respectively. Therefore, the dominant and cost-effective treatment option was alendronate. In the one-way sensitivity analysis, the impact of annual 25% increase or decrease in the teriparatide cost on its ICER was remarkable. Also, reducing the discount rate from 0.03 to 0.0 had the greatest impact on the ICER of the teriparatide. Conclusion: The treatment strategy of teriparatide is more expensive than risedronate and alendronate and is associated with very little increase in QALYs.

18693,Economic Evaluation of Fulvestrant 500 mg Compared to Generic Aromatase Inhibitors in Patients with Advanced Breast Cancer in Sweden,"OBJECTIVES: In Sweden, breast cancer (BC) represents 30% of newly diagnosed cancers and is the most common cancer in women. For hormone-dependent BC, endocrine therapies varying in efficacy and price are available. The aim of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of fulvestrant 500 mg as a second-line hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive metastatic or locally advanced BC versus letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane in Sweden. METHODS: A three-state (pre-progression, post-progression, and death) partitioned-survival model was used to estimate progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by extrapolating trial results beyond the trial period to capture costs and benefits over a lifetime perspective. The comparative effectiveness was sourced from a network meta-analysis. The evaluation was conducted from a Swedish national payer perspective; costs, resource use, and quality of life were based on published sources and expert opinion. RESULTS: Compared to anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were euro33,808, euro33,883, and euro49,225 per QALY with incremental costs of euro13,283, euro14,986, and euro13,862, and incremental QALYs of 0.393, 0.442, and 0.282, respectively. Incremental cost per life-year (LY) gained euro21,312 (incremental LY of 0.623), euro20,338 (incremental LY of 0.737), and euro27,854 (incremental LY of 0.498) for respective comparators. Applying the upper and lower credible intervals for PFS/OS from the meta-analysis had the greatest effect on the ICER in the sensitivity analysis.

18696,Cost-Effectiveness of Haemorrhoidal Artery Ligation versus Rubber Band Ligation for the Treatment of Grade II-III Haemorrhoids: Analysis Using Evidence from the HubBLe Trial,"AIM: Haemorrhoids are a common condition, with nearly 30,000 procedures carried out in England in 2014/15, and result in a significant quality-of-life burden to patients and a financial burden to the healthcare system. This study examined the cost effectiveness of haemorrhoidal artery ligation (HAL) compared with rubber band ligation (RBL) in the treatment of grade II-III haemorrhoids. METHOD: This analyses used data from the HubBLe study, a multicentre, open-label, parallel group, randomised controlled trial conducted in 17 acute UK hospitals between September 2012 and August 2015. A full economic evaluation, including long-term cost effectiveness, was conducted from the UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Main outcomes included healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and recurrence. Cost-effectiveness results were presented in terms of incremental cost per QALY gained and cost per recurrence avoided. Extrapolation analysis for 3 years beyond the trial follow-up, two subgroup analyses (by grade of haemorrhoids and recurrence following RBL at baseline), and various sensitivity analyses were undertaken. RESULTS: In the primary base-case within-trial analysis, the incremental total mean cost per patient for HAL compared with RBL was pound1027 (95% confidence interval [CI] pound782- pound1272, p < 0.001). The incremental QALYs were 0.01 QALYs (95% CI -0.02 to 0.04, p = 0.49). This generated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound104,427 per QALY. In the extrapolation analysis, the estimated probabilistic ICER was pound21,798 per QALY. Results from all subgroup and sensitivity analyses did not materially change the base-case result. CONCLUSIONS: Under all assessed scenarios, the HAL procedure was not cost effective compared with RBL for the treatment of grade II-III haemorrhoids at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20,000 per QALY; therefore, economically, its use in the NHS should be questioned.",2017-01-25970,29441497,Pharmacoeconom Open,Abualbishr Alshreef,2017,1 / 3,175-184,No,29441497,"Abualbishr Alshreef; Allan J Wailoo; Steven R Brown; James P Tiernan; Angus J M Watson; Katie Biggs; Mike Bradburn; Daniel Hind; Cost-Effectiveness of Haemorrhoidal Artery Ligation versus Rubber Band Ligation for the Treatment of Grade II-III Haemorrhoids: Analysis Using Evidence from the HubBLe Trial, Pharmacoeconom Open, 2017 Sep; 1(3):2509-4262; 175-184",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Haemorrhoidal artery ligation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Rubber band ligation,Piles that prolapse but either spontaneously reduce or require minimal manual replacement,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,"1 Year, 4 years",Not Stated,Not Stated,104427,United Kingdom,2015,174294.07

Using data from studies of randomized controlled trials as well as real-world data, we conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate cost-effectiveness of Nurse-Family Partnership in a hypothetical cohort of first-born children in the United States. Analyses were conducted in 2015. Were all new mothers eligible for Nurse-Family Partnership, the program would produce 0.11 QALYs (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.06, 0.17) at an additional cost of $1,021 (95% CI=-$2,831, $4,414) per nurse-visited child''s lifetime relative to the comparison-group children or $14,642 (95% CI = Savings, $71,877) per QALY gained. However, if applied to high-risk mothers, it would generate 0.19 QALYs (95% CI = 0.09, 0.44) and a net benefit of $2,764 (95% CI =-$1,210, $7,092) per nurse-visited child.

18699,Cost-Effectiveness of Different Durations of Dual-Antiplatelet Use After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention,"BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty regarding the optimal duration of dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Our goal was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different durations of DAPT. METHODS: We created a probabilistic patient-level Markov microsimulation model to assess the discounted lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of short duration (3-6 months: short-duration group) vs standard therapy (12 months: standard-duration group) vs prolonged therapy (30-36 months: long-duration group) in patients undergoing PCI. RESULTS: The majority of patients in the model underwent PCI for stable angina (47.1%) with second-generation drug-eluting stents (62%) and were receiving clopidogrel (83.6%). Short-duration DAPT was the most effective strategy (7.163 +/- 1.098 QALYs) compared with standard-duration DAPT (7.161 +/- 1.097 QALYs) and long-duration DAPT (7.156 +/- 1.097 QALYs). However, the magnitude of these differences was very small. Similarly, the average discounted lifetime cost was CAN$24,859 +/- $6533 for short duration, $25,045 +/- $6533 for standard duration, and $25,046 +/- $6548 for long duration. Thus, in the base-case analysis, short duration was dominant, being more effective and less expensive. However, there was a moderate degree of uncertainty, because short duration was the preferred option in only approximately 55% of simulations at a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000. CONCLUSIONS: Based on a stable angina cohort receiving clopidogrel with second-generation stents, a short duration of DAPT was marginally better.
