9401,Rationing of total knee replacement: a cost-effectiveness analysis on a large trial data set,"Objectives Many UK primary care trusts have recently introduced eligibility criteria restricting total knee replacement (TKR) to patients with low pre-operative Oxford Knee Scores (OKS) to cut expenditure. We evaluate these criteria by assessing the cost-effectiveness of TKR compared with no knee replacement for patients with different baseline characteristics from an NHS perspective. Design The cost-effectiveness of TKR in different patient subgroups was assessed using regression analyses of patient-level data from the Knee Arthroplasty Trial, a large, pragmatic randomised trial comparing knee prostheses. Setting 34 UK hospitals. Participants 2131 osteoarthritis patients undergoing TKR. Interventions and outcome measures Costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) observed in the Knee Arthroplasty Trial within 5 years of TKR were compared with conservative assumptions about the costs and outcomes that would have been accrued had TKR not been performed. Results On average, primary TKR and 5 years of subsequent care cost ?7458 per patient (SD: ?4058), and patients gained an average of 1.33 (SD: 1.43) QALYs. As a result, TKR cost ?5623/QALY gained. Although costs and health outcomes varied with age and sex, TKR cost <?20?000/QALY gained for patients with American Society of Anaesthesiologists grades 1-2 who had baseline OKS <40 and for American Society of Anaesthesiologists grade 3 patients with OKS <35, even with highly conservative assumptions about costs and outcomes without TKR. Body mass index had no significant effect on costs or outcomes. Restricting TKR to patients with pre-operative OKS <27 would inappropriately deny a highly cost-effective treatment to >10?000 patients annually. Conclusions TKR is highly cost-effective for most current patients if the NHS is willing to pay ?20?000-?30?000/QALY gained. At least 97% of TKR patients in England have more severe symptoms than the thresholds we have identified, suggesting that further rationing by OKS is probably unjustified.

9402,Intensive Case Finding and Isoniazid Preventative Therapy in HIV Infected Individuals in Africa: Economic Model and Value of Information Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) accounts of much of the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different strategies to actively screen for TB disease in HIV positive individuals, where isoniazid preventative therapy (IPT) is given to those screening negative, and use value of information analysis (VOI) to identify future research priorities. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We built an individual sampling model to investigate the costs (2010 US Dollars) and consequences of screening for TB, and providing TB treatment or IPT in adults testing HIV positive in Sub-Saharan Africa. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess performance of the nine different TB screening strategies evaluated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to incorporate decision uncertainty, and expected value of perfect information for the entire model and for groups of parameters was calculated. Screening all HIV infected individuals with sputum microscopy was the least costly strategy, with other strategies not cost-effective at WHO recommended thresholds. Screening those with TB symptoms with sputum microscopy and CXR would be cost-effective at a threshold ICER of $7,800 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but associated with significant uncertainty. VOI analysis suggests further information would be of value. CONCLUSIONS/ SIGNIFICANCE: Resource-constrained countries in sub-Saharan Africa wishing to scale up TB preventative services in their HIV infected populations should consider expanding laboratory facilities to enable increased screening for TB with sputum microscopy, whilst improved estimates of the TB prevalence in the population to be screened are needed, as it may influence the optimal strategy.",2012-01-08579,22291958,PLoS One,Hendramoorthy Maheswaran,2012,7 /,e30457,No,22291958,"Hendramoorthy Maheswaran; Pelham Barton; Intensive Case Finding and Isoniazid Preventative Therapy in HIV Infected Individuals in Africa: Economic Model and Value of Information Analysis, PLoS One , ; 7 ():1932-6203; e30457",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sputum microscopy in TB suspects and if negative perform a chest x-ray (CXR) vs. Screening all individuals with sputum microscopy,Not Stated,Not Stated,17 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,7775,United States,2010,9228.16

9405,Cost-effectiveness of Adding an Agent That Improves Immune Responses to Initial Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) in HIV-Infected Patients: Guidance for Drug Development,"Purpose: Adding an immune-enhancing agent to initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV is a potential strategy to ensure that patients achieve optimal immune response. Method: Using a mathematical model of HIV disease and treatment, we evaluated the treatment benefits and cost-effectiveness of adding a hypothetical immune-enhancing agent to the initial 6 months of ART. We assumed that the additional agent would result in a higher CD4 increase that would provide clinical benefit. The additional cost ($1,900/month) was based on the cost of a drug currently under investigation for immune enhancement. Outcomes included projected life expectancy and cost-effectiveness in 2009 US dollars/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) with costs and QALYs discounted at 3% annually. Results: Compared to standard ART, immune-enhanced ART resulting in an additional 40 CD4 cell/?L increase at 6 months yields a 2.4 month projected undiscounted life expectancy increase with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $107,600/QALY. Achieving a cost-effectiveness ratio<$100,000/QALY requires a >43 CD4 cell/?L improvement, or ?19 cells/?L if immune-enhancing agent costs are halved.

9409,Cost-effectiveness of a Fourth-Generation Combination Immunoassay for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Antibody and p24 Antigen for the Detection of HIV Infections in the United States,"Purpose: The US Food and Drug Administration recently approved the first 4th-generation HIV test. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the 4th-generation assay versus a 3rd-generation test in screening for HIV infections in the United States. Methods: An exploratory microsimulation model was developed that follows hypothetical individuals and simulates the course of HIV/AIDS, treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy, and transmissions. Results: With a 1% HIV prevalence, screening 1.5 million individuals with the 4th- versus 3rd-generation assay resulted in detection of 266 additional HIV cases at an incremental cost per additional HIV case detected of $63,763, an additional 489 life years and 395 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and 26 HIV transmissions prevented. Although lifetime costs were increased by $33.6 million, the incremental cost/QALY gained was $85,206. The 4th-generation test was more cost-effective in high incidence settings. The number needed to screen to detect one additional HIV case was 5,635. Conclusions: Screening using the 4th-generation assay may be cost-effective for HIV detection in appropriate settings, resulting in increased case identification, fewer transmissions, extended life, and increased quality of life. With early and accurate detection, this 4th-generation test may provide a suitable alternative to current 3rd-generation tests.",2012-01-08590,22306584,HIV Clin Trials,Lael Cragin,2012,13 /,11-22,No,22306584,"Lael Cragin; Feng Pan; Siyang Peng; Jonathan M Zenilman; Julia Green; Cynthia Doucet; Donald B Chalfin; Greg de Lissovoy; Cost-effectiveness of a Fourth-Generation Combination Immunoassay for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Antibody and p24 Antigen for the Detection of HIV Infections in the United States, HIV Clin Trials, ; 13 ():1528-4336; 11-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening with 4th-generation HIV Antigen/Antibodies combo assay vs. Screening with 3rd-generation enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) sensitive to immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG),Not Stated,64 Years,13 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,85206,United States,2010,101131.13

Rationale: Efficiency frontier methodology has the potential to systematically improve the information used in policy and decision making, though it is still relatively uncommon in health economics. Anticoagulation in elective orthopedic surgery provides a fitting and timely case study for examining the influence of choosing one methodology over another. Methods: An economic model was developed to capture the relative benefits and consequences of choosing one anticoagulation strategy over another in the context of orthopedic surgery. Three novel oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) are compared with enoxaparin 40 mg daily from the UK National Health Service perspective using traditional cost-effectiveness estimates (cost/quality-adjusted life years, cost/life years gained) and the efficiency frontier.

9414,Anticoagulation prophylaxis in orthopedic surgery: an efficiency frontier approach,"This study assesses the use of new anticoagulants for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery using traditional cost-effectiveness analysis and efficiency frontier methodology. Rationale: Efficiency frontier methodology has the potential to systematically improve the information used in policy and decision making, though it is still relatively uncommon in health economics. Anticoagulation in elective orthopedic surgery provides a fitting and timely case study for examining the influence of choosing one methodology over another. Methods: An economic model was developed to capture the relative benefits and consequences of choosing one anticoagulation strategy over another in the context of orthopedic surgery. Three novel oral anticoagulants (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran) are compared with enoxaparin 40 mg daily from the UK National Health Service perspective using traditional cost-effectiveness estimates (cost/quality-adjusted life years, cost/life years gained) and the efficiency frontier. The latter explicitly includes embolic and bleeding events as outcomes. A 5-year time horizon was adopted. Results: Total discounted costs ranged from about ?200 000 to ?431 000 over 5 years per 1000 patients undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty, and from ?243 000 to ?463 000 per 1000 patients for elective total knee arthroplasty.

This study aimed to estimate the costs of dyspepsia in a rural and urban population in Malaysia.Economic evaluation was performed based on the cost-of-illness method. Resource utilization and quality of life data over a specific time frame, were collected to determine direct, indirect and intangible costs related to dyspepsia.The prevalences of dyspepsia in the rural (n = 2,000) and urban (n = 2,039) populations were 14.6% and 24.3% respectively. Differences in socioeconomic status and healthcare utilisation between both populations were considerable. The cost of dyspepsia per 1,000 population per year was estimated at USD14,816.10 and USD59,282.20 in the rural and urban populations respectively. The cost per quality adjusted life year for dyspepsia in rural and urban adults was USD16.30 and USD69.75, respectively.The economic impact of dyspepsia is greater in an urban compared to a rural setting.

9417,Cost-utility analysis of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab in neovascular age-related macular degeneration using a Markov model,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal bevacizumab to ranibizumab in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD).A cost-utility analysis using a Markov model was performed to evaluate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER, $US per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained] between bevacizumab and ranibizumab from a US payer perspective. Transition probabilities for ranibizumab and bevacizumab were extrapolated from published studies and local institutional data. Utility values, likewise, were obtained from another published study. Mortality rates were determined from the Centers for Disease Control 2003 Life Tables. Resource utilization and total direct costs were estimated using the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Veterans Affairs Decision Support System. A hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients was simulated through the model for 20 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) on all costs, transition probabilities and utility values. An acceptability curve was generated to illustrate the cost-effectiveness probability of bevacizumab to ranibizumab with increasing willingness-to-pay (WTP).The cost-effectiveness ratios (CER) for bevacizumab and ranibizumab were $1405 per QALY and $12,177 per QALY, respectively. The ICER for bevacizumab was dominant compared to ranibizumab. The base-case CER was sensitive to drug costs of the study medications with a breakeven point of $44 for ranibizumab and $2666 for bevacizumab. PSA revealed a 95% probability of bevacizumab being more cost-effective than ranibizumab at a WTP of $50,000 per QALY gained.Based on a WTP defined at $50,000 per QALY gained, bevacizumab was cost-effective versus ranibizumab 95% of the time because of lower acquisition costs and increased efficacy.",2012-01-08602,20846318,J Eval Clin Pract,Jignesh J Patel,2012,18 /,247-55,No,20846318,"Jignesh J Patel; Margaret A S Mendes; Mark Bounthavong; Melissa L D Christopher; Daniel Boggie; Anthony P Morreale; Cost-utility analysis of bevacizumab versus ranibizumab in neovascular age-related macular degeneration using a Markov model, J Eval Clin Pract, ; 18 ():1356-1294; 247-55",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ranbizumab vs. Bevacizumab,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,Not Stated,-54683.91,United States,2007,-68258.22
9418,Deep brain stimulation compared with methadone maintenance for the treatment of heroin dependence: a threshold and cost-effectiveness analysis,"To determine the success threshold at which a theoretical course of deep brain stimulation (DBS) would provide the same quality of life (QoL) and cost-effectiveness for heroin dependence as methadone maintenance treatment (MMT).We constructed a decision analysis model to calculate QoL after 6 months of MMT and compared it to a theoretical course of DBS. We also performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using societal costs of heroin dependence, MMT and DBS.Systematic literature review and meta-analysis.Patients (n = 1191) from 15 trials administering 6 months of MMT and patients (n = 2937) from 45 trials of DBS for movement disorders.Data on QoL before and after MMT, retention in MMT at 6 months, as well as complications of DBS and their impact on QoL in movement disorders.We found a QoL of 0.633 (perfect health = 1) in heroin addicts initiating MMT. Sixty-six per cent of patients completed MMT, but only 47% of them had opiate-free urine samples, resulting in an average QoL of 0.7148 (0.3574 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 6 months). A trial of DBS is less expensive ($81,000) than untreated (or relapsed) heroin dependence ($100,000), but more expensive than MMT ($58,000). A theoretical course of DBS would need a success rate of 36.5% to match MMT, but a success rate of 49% to be cost-effective.The success rate, defined as the percentage of patients remaining heroin-free after 6 months of treatment, at which deep brain stimulation would be similarly cost-effective in treating opiate addiction to methadone maintenance treatment, is estimated at 49%.",2012-01-08611,21919988,Addiction,James H Stephen,2011,107 /,624-34,No,21919988,"James H Stephen; Casey H Halpern; Cristian J Barrios; Usha Balmuri; Jared M Pisapia; John A Wolf; Kyle M Kampman; Gordon H Baltuch; Arthur L Caplan; Sherman C Stein; Deep brain stimulation compared with methadone maintenance for the treatment of heroin dependence: a threshold and cost-effectiveness analysis, Addiction, ; 107 ():0965-2140; 624-34",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Deep brain stimulation (DBS) vs. Methadone maintenance therapy (MMT),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,40334.42,United States,2011,46408.1
9419,Performing a cost analysis in spine outcomes research: comparing ventral and dorsal approaches for cervical spondylotic myelopathy,"Medical cost analysis is increasingly important, but the methodology is complex and varied.To illustrate how different cost analysis methodologies influence conclusions generated from data from a prospective nonrandomized trial for treatment of cervical spondylotic myelopathy.Patients 40 to 85 years of age with degenerative cervical spondylotic myelopathy were enrolled from 7 sites over 2 years (2007-2009). Patients were treated with ventral or dorsal fusion surgery, and outcomes were measured to 1 year postoperatively. A hospital-based cost analysis was performed using Medicare cost-to-charge ratios (CCRs) multiplied by hospital charges from the index hospitalization (CCR method). A society-based cost analysis was performed by estimating costs from the index hospitalization using Medicare coding reimbursement (the Medicare reimbursement method). A separate outpatient cost analysis was performed on a subset of 20 patients.Of the 85 patients analyzed, 72 had 1-year follow-up. The CCR method showed a difference in upfront direct costs between the dorsal and ventral approaches ($27,942 ? 14,220 vs $21,563 ? 8721; P = .02). Overall upfront direct costs with the Medicare reimbursement method were not different. With the CCR method, the ventral approach dominates an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis. With the Medicare reimbursement method, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ventral surgery is $34,533, the cost of 1 additional quality-adjusted life-year gained by using ventral instead of dorsal surgery. In the subanalysis, outpatient costs were less after ventral surgery than dorsal surgery ($1997 ? 1211 vs $4734 ? $2874; P = .006).The choice of cost methodology may substantially influence the final results of an economic study.",2012-01-08613,21937935,Neurosurgery,Robert G Whitmore,2012,70 /,860-7; discussion 867,No,21937935,"Robert G Whitmore; J Sanford Schwartz; Sydney Simmons; Sherman C Stein; Zoher Ghogawala; Performing a cost analysis in spine outcomes research: comparing ventral and dorsal approaches for cervical spondylotic myelopathy, Neurosurgery, ; 70 ():0148-396X; 860-7; discussion 867",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ventral fusion surgery performed with a multilevel diskectomy with fusion and plating vs. Dorsal fusion surgery performed with a midline cervical laminectomy,Not Stated,85 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-212633.34,United States,2010,-252374.84

The surgical outcomes, survival, and QoL that was determined using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary instrument were analyzed and compared.Patients who underwent surgery had a median overall survival of 17 months, compared with patients who underwent chemotherapy for 8 months (P<0.0001). Patients who underwent surgery had a median recurrence-free survival of 14 months, as compared with patients who underwent chemotherapy for 7 months (P<0.0001). The probabilities of 1-year recurrence in the surgery and chemotherapy groups were 27.7 and 70%, respectively (P<0.0001). The QoL total score of the surgery group was significantly higher than that of the control group (P<0.0001). Surgery was slightly, though significantly more cost-effective than chemotherapy based on the quality-adjusted life years.Hepatectomy and thrombectomy using the total hepatic vascular exclusion, is a viable surgical management for patients with HCC and PVTT, and is associated with longer overall survival and recurrence-free survival and better QoL than chemotherapy alone.",2012-01-08623,22081008,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Jianping Liu,2012,24 /,186-94,No,22081008,"Jianping Liu; Yang Wang; Dawei Zhang; Bo Liu; Qingjia Ou; Comparison of survival and quality of life of hepatectomy and thrombectomy using total hepatic vascular exclusion and chemotherapy alone in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and tumor thrombi in the inferior vena cava and hepatic vein, Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol, ; 24 ():0954-691X; 186-94",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Surgical management, resectioning of hepatic tumors and thrombi (hepatectomy and thrombectomy) and postoperative systemic chemotherapy vs. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and systemic chemotherapy",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,9263.58,United States,2010,10994.96

The comparators were enoxaparin and fondaparinux, as identified in the scope issued by NICE. The School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. Clinical-effectiveness evidence for DBG versus enoxaparin was derived from two randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trials, one for THR and the other for TKR. Clinical-effectiveness evidence for DBG versus fondaparinux was taken from a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) and from one study. The results presented show that DBG at the licensed dose of 220?mg and 150?mg once daily was noninferior to enoxaparin (40?mg once daily) in terms of the primary efficacy outcome of total VTE and all-cause mortality. In the MTC, fondaparinux was found to be more effective than DBG; the level of statistical significance was not reported. The manufacturer's cost-effectiveness model estimated that at a dose of 220?mg once a day, DBG dominated enoxaparin in both THR and TKR. At a dose of 150?mg daily, DBG dominated enoxaparin in THR, while enoxaparin dominated DBG in TKR. At a dose of 220?mg daily, DBG was less cost effective than fondaparinux in THR. The cost per QALY gained for fondaparinux versus DBG was ?11,111 (year 2008 values). At a dose of 150?mg daily, DBG was less cost effective than fondaparinux in THR.

9425,Dabigatran etexilate for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients undergoing elective hip or knee surgery: a NICE single technology appraisal,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, the manufacturer of dabigatran etexilate (DBG), to submit evidence on the clinical and cost effectiveness of this drug for the primary prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients who have undergone total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) surgery, as part of NICE's single technology appraisal process. The comparators were enoxaparin and fondaparinux, as identified in the scope issued by NICE. The School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE's subsequent decisions. Clinical-effectiveness evidence for DBG versus enoxaparin was derived from two randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trials, one for THR and the other for TKR. Clinical-effectiveness evidence for DBG versus fondaparinux was taken from a mixed treatment comparison (MTC) and from one study. The results presented show that DBG at the licensed dose of 220?mg and 150?mg once daily was noninferior to enoxaparin (40?mg once daily) in terms of the primary efficacy outcome of total VTE and all-cause mortality. In the MTC, fondaparinux was found to be more effective than DBG; the level of statistical significance was not reported. The manufacturer's cost-effectiveness model estimated that at a dose of 220?mg once a day, DBG dominated enoxaparin in both THR and TKR. At a dose of 150?mg daily, DBG dominated enoxaparin in THR, while enoxaparin dominated DBG in TKR. At a dose of 220?mg daily, DBG was less cost effective than fondaparinux in THR.

9426,Implementing an influenza vaccination programme for adults aged =65 years in Poland: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Influenza is a common respiratory disease occurring in seasonal patterns, and may lead to severe complications in frail populations such as the elderly. In Poland, influenza vaccination is recommended for people aged =65 years; however the vaccine coverage rate in the elderly is very low. The fact that influenza vaccine is neither reimbursed by the National Health Insurance (Narodowy Fundusz Zdrowia [NFZ]) nor financed via a National Immunization Program (NIP) could be a reason for the low coverage rate. This study assessed the cost effectiveness of the full reimbursement of an influenza vaccination programme in Poland for people aged =65 years.A decision-analytic model was developed to compare costs and outcomes associated with the current situation in which influenza vaccination is not reimbursed and a new situation in which it would be fully covered by the NFZ. The model was parameterized to Poland using data from the literature and from the Central Statistic Office of Poland. Within the elderly population, 50% were considered to be at high risk of influenza complications. An influenza attack rate of 3.5% was used for calculation purposes. Influenza-associated hospitalizations and death rates were estimated at 439.9 per 100?000 person-years and 79.1 per 100?000 person-years, respectively. Cost estimates were derived from a cost study conducted in Poland. Costs are presented in Polish Zloty (PLN) [2009 mean exchange rate: 1 PLN?=??0.232]. Only direct medical costs were included to fit to the NFZ perspective. To reflect the seasonality of influenza, a time horizon of 1 year was chosen. Life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) accumulated over future years were discounted at a rate of 5% as recommended by Polish guidelines. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.In Poland, the introduction of the public funding of influenza vaccination for people aged =65 years would cost PLN 79?million when an increase in coverage rate from 13.5% to 40% is assumed. 23?900 cases of influenza, 1777 hospitalizations and 548 premature deaths would be averted each year due to the influenza vaccination programme. Fifty-seven persons would need to be vaccinated to prevent one case of influenza. To prevent one hospitalization and one death due to influenza, 842 and 2809 individuals would need to be vaccinated, respectively. The new strategy would be very cost effective compared with the current situation with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PLN26?118/QALY, which is below the 2009 yearly gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Deterministic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the most influential variables for the ICER were vaccine efficacy against death, excess hospitalization rate, utility norms, influenza attack rate, vaccine efficacy against hospitalization, and discount rates. All ICERs computed were below the threshold of 3 GDP per capita. From the probabilistic analysis, the proposed new influenza vaccination programme, if implemented, was predicted to be cost effective from the NFZ perspective with a probability of 100%, given the same threshold.Implementing a vaccination programme in Poland in which influenza vaccination would be fully reimbursed by the NFZ for people aged =65 years would be a very cost-effective strategy.",2012-01-08634,22201294,Clin Drug Investig,Lidia Brydak,2012,32 /,73-85,Yes,22201294,"Lidia Brydak; Julie Roiz; Pascaline Faivre; Camille Reygrobellet; Implementing an influenza vaccination programme for adults aged =65 years in Poland: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Clin Drug Investig, ; 32 ():1173-2563; 73-85",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full reimbursement of influenza vaccination by the National Health Insurance vs. Influenza vaccination paid for by the private sector,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,5.00,26118,Poland,2009,10898.61

9431,Cost-effectiveness of semi-annual surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients of the Italian Liver Cancer population,"It was recently shown that semi-annual surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cirrhotic patients provides a prognostic advantage over the annual program; however, its cost-effectiveness (CE) in the general cirrhotic population still needs to be defined.A Markov model was built to compare CE of these two strategies, considering literature results and treatment modalities of 918 cirrhotic patients from the Italian Liver Cancer (ITA.LI.CA) database.Results from the Markov model suggest that, compared to annual surveillance, semi-annual surveillance leads to a gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy, in an unselected cirrhotic population, of 1.35 quality-adjusted life-months (QALMs) over 10 years since surveillance start in compensated patients, and of 0.73 QALMs in decompensated patients.

9436,Cost-effectiveness achieved through changing the composition of renal replacement therapy in Japan,"The cost-effectiveness of renal replacement therapy (RRT) is affected by the composition of treatment. This study aimed to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with changing the composition of RRT modality over time.By using clinical and cost data from a systematic review, a Markov model was developed to assess the costs and benefits of the four main treatments available for RRT in Japan. The model included direct health service costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results.Over the 15-year period of the model, the current composition of RRT (i.e., the base composition of RRT) was $84,008/QALY. The most cost-effective treatment was when the likelihood of a living donor transplant was increased by 2.4-times ($70,581/QALY). Compared with the base composition of RRT, dominant treatments with respect to cost-effectiveness were when the likelihood of a deceased donor transplant was increased by 22-times and when the likelihood of a pre-emptive living donor transplant was increased by 2.4-times. Little difference was found between these two treatments.

In light of this new information, this study aimed to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of celecoxib plus PPI compared to diclofenac plus PPI.NICE developed a health economic model as part of their 2008 multiple technology assessment of treatments for osteoarthritis. The model was adapted for this study to update the relative risks of adverse events, using data from the CONDOR trial.Using the AE data from the CLASS trial alone, celecoxib plus PPI has an ICER of ?9538 per QALY when compared to diclofenac plus PPI. When the AE data from CONDOR alone is used, this ICER decreases to ?4773 per QALY. Using the pooled data from both trials, celecoxib plus PPI has an ICER of ?9377 per QALY compared to diclofenac plus PPI.The results suggest that when new AE risks are used, celecoxib plus PPI remains a cost-effective treatment for OA when compared to diclofenac plus PPI.

9446,Cost effectiveness of saxagliptin and metformin versus sulfonylurea and metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Germany: a Cardiff diabetes model analysis,"The lack of adequate glycaemic control for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), especially with existing second-line therapies, represents an unmet medical need. Of the newer therapies, the incretin-based medicines, such as saxagliptin, look promising to consolidate second-line pharmacotherapy.This study evaluates the long-term economic consequences of saxagliptin versus sulfonylurea (glipizide) as second-line therapy when used in combination with metformin after failure of monotherapy treatment with metformin, in patients with T2DM in Germany.A published discrete event simulation model with a fixed-time increment was used to model the effects of different treatment scenarios over a 40-year (life-) time horizon. Disease progression was modelled using evidence from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) 68. The treatment sequence matched that of published German guidelines, and efficacy and safety data were derived from published sources. The model assumes that quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are affected by complications, hypoglycaemic events and weight change over a lifetime. Costs were specific to the German setting, where sulfonylureas are generic. Costs and effects were discounted annually at 3%. The extended perspective of the national sick funds was adopted, and recommendations from the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) were considered.In the base-case analysis, treatment with saxagliptin plus metformin was associated with a lower incidence of both symptomatic and severe hypoglycaemic events, resulting in an incremental benefit of 0.12 QALYs and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ?13,931 per QALY gained compared with sulfonylurea plus metformin (year of costing 2009). Modest reductions in all macro- and microvascular complications were seen in those receiving saxagliptin plus metformin compared with sulfonylurea plus metformin. Sensitivity analysis showed that treatment-related weight changes, as a risk factor for complications, represent the most influential driver of cost effectiveness.The study demonstrated improved outcomes with saxagliptin at a cost that would likely be considered acceptable in the German setting. Furthermore, the findings of the sensitivity analysis suggest that the results are robust to various assumptions concerning input variables and modelling assumptions.",2012-01-08666,22292415,Clin Drug Investig,Wilma Erhardt,2012,32 /,189-202,Yes,22292415,"Wilma Erhardt; Klas Bergenheim; Isabelle Duprat-Lomon; Phil McEwan; Cost effectiveness of saxagliptin and metformin versus sulfonylurea and metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Germany: a Cardiff diabetes model analysis, Clin Drug Investig, ; 32 ():1173-2563; 189-202",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Saxagliptin used in combination with metformin after failure of metformin monotherapy vs. Sulfonylurea used in combination with metformin after failure of metformin monotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,13931,Euro,2009,23419.87
9447,Assessing the real-world cost-effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab in HER-2/neu positive breast cancer,"Among women with surgically removed, high-risk HER-2/neu-positive breast cancer, trastuzumab has demonstrated significant improvements in disease-free and overall survival. The objective of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the currently recommended 12-month adjuvant protocol of trastuzumab using a Markov modeling approach and real-world cost data.A 10-health-state Markov model tracked patients' quarterly transitions between health states in the local and advanced states of breast cancer. Clinical data were obtained from the joint analysis of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project and North Central Cancer Treatment Group, as well as from the metastatic study conducted by Norum et al. Clinical outcomes were adjusted for quality of life using utility estimates published in a systematic review. Real cost data were obtained from the British Columbia Cancer Agency and were evaluated from a payer perspective. Costs and utilities were discounted at 5% per year, respectively, for a 28-year time horizon.In the base case analysis, treatment with a 12-month adjuvant trastuzumab regimen resulted in a gain of 1.38 quality-adjusted life years or 1.17 life years gained at a cost of $18,133 per patient. Thus, the cost per QALY gained for the base case is $13,095. Cost per LYG is $15,492.Over the long term, treatment of HER-2/neu mutation positive breast cancer with a 12-month protocol of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting is predicted to be cost-effective in a Canadian context.",2012-01-08673,22302231,Oncologist,Lindsay Hedden,2012,17 /,164-71,No,22302231,"Lindsay Hedden; Susan O'Reilly; Caroline Lohrisch; Stephen Chia; Caroline Speers; Laurel Kovacic; Suzanne Taylor; Stuart Peacock; Assessing the real-world cost-effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab in HER-2/neu positive breast cancer, Oncologist, ; 17 ():1083-7159; 164-71",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,12-month adjuvant trastuzumab vs. Standard chemotherapy,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,28 Years,5.00,5.00,13095,Canada,2010,15097.93
9448,Cost-effectiveness of several atypical antipsychotics in orally disintegrating tablets compared with standard oral tablets in the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States,"Although the use of innovative drug delivery systems, like orally disintegrating antipsychotic tablets (ODT), may facilitate medication adherence and help reduce the risk of relapse and hospitalization, no information is available about the comparative cost-effectiveness of standard oral tablets (SOT) vs ODT formulations in the treatment of schizophrenia. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of olanzapine ODT and olanzapine SOT in the usual treatment of outpatients with schizophrenia from a US healthcare perspective. The study also compared olanzapine ODT with risperidone and aripiprazole, two other atypical antipsychotics available in both ODT and SOT formulations.Published medical literature and a clinical expert panel were used to populate a 1-year Monte Carlo Micro-simulation model.

9460,Health economic modelling of the cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening in Switzerland,"Current evidence indicates that chronic kidney disease (CKD) can be detected by simple laboratory tests. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening and subsequent treatment in different populations.Cost-effectiveness of microalbuminuria screening in a cohort of simulated subjects aged =50 years was assessed using a validated microsimulation model. Microalbuminuria screening was simulated for 1-, 2-, 5- or 10-year intervals and for 3 groups: diabetes (DM), hypertension but no diabetes (HTN), and no diabetes or hypertension. Positive microalbuminuria screening was followed by treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs).

9461,Cost-effectiveness of dabigatran compared with warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack,"The cost-effectiveness of dabigatran for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack has not been directly assessed.A Markov decision model was constructed using data from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Therapy (RE-LY) trial, other trials of warfarin therapy for atrial fibrillation, and the published cost of dabigatran. We compared the cost and quality-adjusted life expectancy associated with 150 mg dabigatran twice daily versus warfarin therapy targeted to an international normalized ratio of 2 to 3. The target population was a cohort of patients aged =70 years with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, prior stroke or transient ischemic attack, and no contraindication to anticoagulation.In the base case, dabigatran was associated with 4.27 quality-adjusted life-years compared with 3.91 quality-adjusted life-years with warfarin. Dabigatran provided 0.36 additional quality-adjusted life-years at a cost of $9000, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $25,000. In sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran was inversely related to the quality of international normalized ratio control achieved with warfarin therapy. In Monte Carlo analysis, dabigatran was cost-effective in 57% of simulations using a threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year and 78% of simulations using a threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year.Dabigatran appears to be cost-effective relative to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack.

9462,Cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve replacement compared with standard care among inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis: results from the placement of aortic transcatheter valves (PARTNER) trial (Cohort B),"In patients with severe aortic stenosis who cannot have surgery, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been shown to improve survival and quality of life compared with standard therapy, but the costs and cost-effectiveness of this strategy are not yet known.The PARTNER trial randomized patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis who were not candidates for surgery to TAVR (n=179) or standard therapy (n=179). Empirical data regarding survival, quality of life, medical resource use, and hospital costs were collected during the trial and used to project life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime medical care costs to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of TAVR from a US perspective. For patients treated with TAVR, mean costs for the initial procedure and hospitalization were $42 806 and $78 542, respectively. Follow-up costs through 12 months were lower with TAVR ($29 289 versus $53 621) because of reduced hospitalization rates, but cumulative 1-year costs remained higher ($106 076 versus $53 621). We projected that over a patient's lifetime, TAVR would increase discounted life expectancy by 1.6 years (1.3 quality-adjusted life-years) at an incremental cost of $79 837. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for TAVR was thus estimated at $50 200 per year of life gained or $61 889 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. These results were stable across a broad range of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses.For patients with severe aortic stenosis who are not candidates for surgery, TAVR increases life expectancy at an incremental cost per life-year gained well within accepted values for commonly used cardiovascular technologies.URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

9463,Economic evaluation of tocilizumab combination in the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in Italy,"This study was designed to evaluate the cost utility of tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, with inadequate responses to traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (tDMARDs) from a payer's perspective in Italy.An individual patient simulation model was used to project lifetime medical costs (payer's perspective) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Treatment sequences starting with tocilizumab or the most commonly prescribed biologics (etanercept, adalimumab, or infliximab) were compared. The addition of tocilizumab to standard of care, without the replacement of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a treatments, was also evaluated. Patient characteristics, treatment efficacy, and quality-of-life data were based on three phase 3 tocilizumab clinical trials (TOcilizumab Pivotal Trial in Methotrexate Inadequate respONders [OPTION], Tocilizumab in cOmbination With traditional DMARD therapy [TOWARD], and TociLIzumab Safety and THE Prevention of Structural Joint Damage [LITHE]). Mixed-treatment comparison was used to estimate response probabilities. Resource utilization, treatment acquisition, administration, and monitoring costs were estimated using Italian secondary sources. Uncertainty in model parameters was evaluated by probabilistic sensitivity analysis.Replacement of anti-TNF-a treatments with tocilizumab reduced total costs over a patient's lifetime (base-case analysis: tocilizumab sequence, ?141,100 vs standard of care sequence, ?143,500). Patients receiving tocilizumab realized more QALYs than patients receiving standard of care (9.8881 vs 9.3502 QALYs). Therefore, according to the base-case analysis, the tocilizumab sequence dominated the standard of care. In a sensitivity analysis, the model base-case result was robust to input changes. When tocilizumab was added to standard of care, without replacing anti-TNF-a treatments, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was ?17,100 per QALY.The analysis demonstrates that, in Italy, replacing another biologic DMARD with tocilizumab or adding tocilizumab to the current standard of care is a cost-effective strategy in the treatment of RA patients with inadequate responses to tDMARDs.",2012-01-08688,22313326,J Med Econ,Alexander Diamantopoulos,2012,15 /,576-85,Yes,22313326,"Alexander Diamantopoulos; Maurizio Benucci; Stefano Capri; Wolfgang Berger; Neil Wintfeld; Giovanni Giuliani; Walter Ricciardi; Economic evaluation of tocilizumab combination in the treatment of moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis in Italy, J Med Econ, ; 15 ():1369-6998; 576-85",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Tocilizumab followed by adalimumab, rituximab and abatacept vs. Standard of care (etanercept followed by adalimumab, rituximab and abatacept)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-4397.62,Euro,2009,-7392.99
9464,Cost-effectiveness of cinacalcet in secondary hyperparathyroidism in the United States,"Cinacalcet has been used in controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in dialysis patients since 2004, but its full economic evaluation has not been conducted from the US perspective. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of cinacalcet and low-dose vitamin D for the treatment of SHPT in dialysis patients compared with flexible vitamin D.A lifetime patient-level simulation model was developed using ADVANCE trial data, including biomarker levels: parathyroid hormone, calcium, and phosphorus. The impact of the biomarkers on mortality, cardiovascular events, fractures, and parathyroidectomy were estimated from literature: Block, an observational study; Cunningham, a combined analysis of four randomized trials of cinacalcet; and Danese, a study investigating the effect of duration in recommended targets. Baseline event rates were derived from the large dialysis organizations registries. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted.The cost-effectiveness ratio for cinacalcet compared with standard of care (vitamin D and phosphate binders) was $54,560 and $72,456/quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained or an incremental cost of $3155 and $2638 per year alive for the Block and Danese variants, respectively. In the Cunningham variant, cost-effectiveness ratio for cinacalcet was $5064/QALY gained or a cost saving of $1068 per year. The difference in the results of the Cunningham variant vs other variants can be explained by the favorable impact of cinacalcet on outcomes, specifically cardiovascular events observed in the Cunningham study. The PSA showed 98% likelihood for cinacalcet to be cost-effective at $100,000/QALY threshold.Observational data assessing effects on clinical outcomes, trial restriction to use calcium-containing phosphate binders, no utility data in SHPT dialysis population, and insufficient evidence on long-term impact of cinacalcet and vitamin D on biochemical markers.Cinacalcet treatment is cost-effective for treatment of SHPT in the US.

9465,Quality of life benefits and cost impact of prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone versus prolonged release oxycodone in patients with moderate-to-severe non-malignant pain and opioid-induced constipation: a UK cost-utility analysis,"To compare the cost effectiveness of prolonged release oxycodone/naloxone (OXN) tablets (Targinact) and prolonged release oxycodone (OXY) tablets (OxyContin) in patients with moderate-to-severe non-malignant pain and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) from the perspective of the UK healthcare system.A cohort model used data from a phase III randomised, controlled trial (RCT). It calculated the cost difference between treatments by combining the cost of pain therapy with costs of laxatives and other resources used to manage constipated patients. SF-36 scores were converted into EQ-5D utility values to calculate the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.The incremental cost of OXN versus OXY was ?159.68 for the average treatment duration of 301 days. OXN gave an incremental QALY gain of 0.0273. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was ?5841.56 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses gave a maximum ICER of ?10,347.03. In some scenarios, OXN dominated with a cost saving of up to ?4254.70. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that OXN had approximately 96.6% probability of cost effectiveness at the ?20,000 threshold.The model was conservative in predicting the probability of constipation beyond the 12-week RCT period. UK cost of constipation data were limited and based on primary care physician opinion.In the base case, direct treatment costs were slightly higher for patients treated with OXN than for those treated with OXY. However, patients treated with OXN experienced a quality of life gain, and had an ICER considerably below thresholds commonly applied in the UK. The model was most sensitive to the estimated cost of constipation with a number of realistic scenarios in the sensitivity analysis demonstrating a cost saving with OXN (OXN dominant).

Clinical events until the end of year 1 (main model) or year 3 (alternative model) were modelled in detail. Adjustments were applied to approximate UK routine practice characteristics. Life expectancy of 1-year or 3-year survivors, health-state utilities, initial hospitalisation length of stay in the comparator strategy and unit costs were based on UK sources. Costs and effects were discounted at 3.5%.The main model predicted bivalirudin and H-GPI patients to survive 11.52 and 11.35 (undiscounted) years on average, respectively, and to accrue 6.26 and 6.17 QALYs. Patient lifetime costs were ?267 lower in the bivalirudin strategy (?12?843 vs ?13?110). Extensive sensitivity and scenario analyses confirmed these results to be robust. In probabilistic analysis, quality-adjusted survival was higher and costs were lower with bivalirudin in 95.0% of simulation runs. In 99.2%, cost-effectiveness was better than ?20?000 per QALY gained. Results from the alternative model were fully consistent.The use of bivalirudin instead of H-GPI in STEMI patients undergoing PPCI is cost-effective, and offers a high probability of dominance.

One-way sensitivity analyses are also performed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is estimated as ?3,873,922/quality adjusted life year (QALY) (US$43,044/QALY), which is not more than the suggested social willingness-to-pay for one QALY gain from an innovative medical intervention in Japan, ?5,000,000/QALY (US$55,556/QALY). However, sensitivity analyses show the instability of this estimation.

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] of ZOL vs CLO was calculated as the ratio of the difference in cost to the difference in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Model inputs were based on results of MMIX and published sources.Compared with CLO, treatment with ZOL increases QALYs by 0.30 at an additional cost of ?1653, yielding an ICER of ?5443 per QALY gained. If the threshold ICER is ?20,000 per QALY, the estimated probability that ZOL is cost-effective is 90%.The main limitation of this study is the lack of data on the effects of zoledronic acid on survival beyond the end of follow-up in the MMIX trial.

9472,Evaluating the cost effectiveness of donepezil in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in Germany using discrete event simulation,"Previous cost-effectiveness studies of cholinesterase inhibitors have modeled Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression and treatment effects through single or global severity measures, or progression to ""Full Time Care"". This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness of donepezil versus memantine or no treatment in Germany by considering correlated changes in cognition, behavior and function.Rates of change were modeled using trial and registry-based patient level data.

9473,Cost-effectiveness analysis of early versus non-early intervention in acute migraine based on evidence from the 'Act when Mild' study,"In spite of the important progress made in the abortive treatment of acute migraine episodes since the introduction of triptans, reduction of pain and associated symptoms is in many cases still not as effective nor as fast as would be desirable. Recent research pays more attention to the timing of the treatment, and taking triptans early in the course of an attack when pain is still mild has been found more efficacious than the usual strategy of waiting for the attack to develop to a higher pain intensity level.To investigate the cost effectiveness of early versus non-early intervention with almotriptan in acute migraine.An economic evaluation was conducted from the perspectives of French society and the French public health system based on patient-level data collected in the AwM (Act when Mild) study, a placebo-controlled trial that compared the response to early and non-early treatment of acute migraine with almotriptan. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were determined in terms of QALYs, migraine hours and productive time lost. Costs were expressed in Euros (year 2010 values). Bootstrapping was used to derive cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.Early treatment has shown to lead to shorter attack duration, less productive time lost, better quality of life, and is, with 92% probability, overall cost saving from a societal point of view. In terms of drug costs only, however, non-early treatment is less expensive. From the public health system perspective, the (bootstrap) mean ICER of early treatment amounts to ?0.38 per migraine hour avoided, ?1.29 per hour of productive time lost avoided, and ?14,296 per QALY gained. Considering willingness-to-pay values of approximately ?1 to avoid an hour of migraine, ?10 to avoid the loss of a productive hour, or ?30,000 to gain one QALY, the approximate probability that early treatment is cost effective is 90%, 90% and 70%, respectively. These results remain robust in different scenarios for the major elements of the economic evaluation.Compared with non-early treatment, a strategy of early treatment of acute migraine with almotriptan when pain is still mild is, with high probability, cost saving from the French societal perspective and can be considered cost effective from the public health system point of view.",2012-01-08700,22320449,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,John Slof,2012,10 / 3,201-15,Yes,22320449,"John Slof; Cost-effectiveness analysis of early versus non-early intervention in acute migraine based on evidence from the 'Act when Mild' study, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, May/1/2012; 10(3):1179-1896; 201-15",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treated attack early (within 1h of onset) and when pain was still mild vs. Treated attack after it had developed to moderate to severe pain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,0 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,14296,Euro,2010,22456.01

9475,Costs of trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer: an economic evaluation in the Chinese context,"Adding trastuzumab to a conventional regimen of chemotherapy can improve survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer, but the economic impact of this practice is unknown.The purpose of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to estimate the effects of adding trastuzumab to standard chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or GEJ cancer on health and economic outcomes in China.A Markov model was developed to simulate the clinical course of typical patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or GEJ cancer. Five-year quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated. Model inputs were derived from the published literature and government sources. Direct costs were estimated from the perspective of Chinese society. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.On baseline analysis, the addition of trastuzumab increased cost and QALY by $56,004.30 (year-2010 US $) and 0.18, respectively, relative to conventional chemotherapy, resulting in an ICER of $251,667.10/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses supported that the addition of trastuzumab was not cost-effective. Budgetary impact analysis estimated that the annual increase in fiscal expenditures would be ~$1 billion. On univariate sensitivity analysis, the median overall survival time for conventional chemotherapy was the most influential factor with respect to the robustness of the model.The findings from the present analysis suggest that the addition of trastuzumab to conventional chemotherapy might not be cost-effective in patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or GEJ cancer.",2012-01-08704,22325735,Clin Ther,Bin Wu,2012,34 /,468-79,Yes,22325735,"Bin Wu; Ming Ye; Huafeng Chen; Jinfang F Shen; Costs of trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy for HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer: an economic evaluation in the Chinese context, Clin Ther, ; 34 ():1879-114X; 468-79",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Trastuzumab as first-line treatment vs. Standard chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,251667,United States,2010,298703.95

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of therapy for mCRC in the eras prior to, and following, the introduction of bevacizumab on a population basis. METHODS: All patients with newly-diagnosed mCRC in 2003/2004 (the pre-bevacizumab era) and 2006 (the post-bevacizumab era) referred to the British Columbia Cancer Agency were included. A cost-utility/cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using 'real-world' data and a Markov approach. Costs were estimated from provincial pharmacy and radiation databases, as well as national inpatient, day-surgery and ambulatory care data sources. Cost per quality adjusted life year gained (QALY) and life year gained (LYG) ratios were calculated, and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Median overall survival improved from 15.6 to 19.5months (p=0.03). For patients in the post-bevacizumab era there was a gain of an average of 0.06QALYs or 0.325LYG at a cost increase of $3791 per patient, resulting in a incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $62,469/QALY or $15,617/LYG.

Information from the interviews and the international literature was used to estimate treatment profiles, availability, uptake and costs, as the basis for a decision analytic model with micro costing of each potential outcome. Sensitivity analyses were conducted with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations randomly varying between each model parameter between minimum and maximum estimates.The treatment provider interviews highlighted the unstructured nature of insomnia treatment in New Zealand. The net cost of treating a person with insomnia was estimated to be -$482. The net annual benefit (saving) for treating insomniacs aged between 20-59 yrs was estimated at $21.8 million.The estimated total societal costs per QALY gained by treating insomnia is substantially lower than the average QALY cost-effectiveness threshold ($6,865) of PHARMAC funding decisions for new pharmaceuticals.

The present analysis estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with these therapies from the perspective of the UK healthcare system.TIMES cohorts receiving TOL, TAM, TOL?+?TAM, or PBO were followed from therapy initiation to 12 weeks. A decision-tree model was used to extrapolate the 12-week results to 1 year (including need for surgery owing to treatment failure at 12 weeks) and to track patients' outcomes (symptoms, utility, and costs). Because TIMES did not include costs and QALYs, data from the EpiLUTS epidemiologic survey (12,796 males) were used to model a mathematical relationship between LUTS (daytime and nocturnal frequency, urgency episodes, urgency urinary incontinence episodes, and International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS]), quality-of-life, and utility. This was used to convert improvements in TIMES patients' LUTS into utility scores and QALYs. The model included drug and surgery procedure costs and hospital length of stay.Incremental QALYs of TOL?+?TAM vs PBO, TAM, and TOL were 0.042, 0.021, and 0.013, and corresponding incremental costs were ?189, ?223, and -?70, respectively, resulting in cost-utility ratios for TOL?+?TAM of ?4508/QALY gained compared with PBO and ?10,381/QALY gained compared with TAM.

9484,Estimating the quality-of-life impact and cost-effectiveness of alpha-blocker and anti-muscarinic combination treatment in men with lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia and overactive bladder,"A 12-week clinical trial (TIMES) demonstrated that therapy with tolterodine extended release (TOL)?+?tamsulosin (TAM) provides clinical benefits vs TOL or TAM monotherapy or placebo (PBO) in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) including overactive bladder (OAB). The present analysis estimated the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with these therapies from the perspective of the UK healthcare system.TIMES cohorts receiving TOL, TAM, TOL?+?TAM, or PBO were followed from therapy initiation to 12 weeks. A decision-tree model was used to extrapolate the 12-week results to 1 year (including need for surgery owing to treatment failure at 12 weeks) and to track patients' outcomes (symptoms, utility, and costs). Because TIMES did not include costs and QALYs, data from the EpiLUTS epidemiologic survey (12,796 males) were used to model a mathematical relationship between LUTS (daytime and nocturnal frequency, urgency episodes, urgency urinary incontinence episodes, and International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS]), quality-of-life, and utility. This was used to convert improvements in TIMES patients' LUTS into utility scores and QALYs. The model included drug and surgery procedure costs and hospital length of stay.Incremental QALYs of TOL?+?TAM vs PBO, TAM, and TOL were 0.042, 0.021, and 0.013, and corresponding incremental costs were ?189, ?223, and -?70, respectively, resulting in cost-utility ratios for TOL?+?TAM of ?4508/QALY gained compared with PBO and ?10,381/QALY gained compared with TAM. TOL?+?TAM combination therapy was both more effective and cost-saving compared with TOL. Univariate sensitivity analyses showed that patient utility was most responsive to changes in drug efficacy on IPSS and urgency episodes. Changing the percentage of patients undergoing surgery did not substantially affect model outcomes. The main limitation of the study was that the relation between LUTS and patient utility was based on an indirect association.TOL?+?TAM combination therapy appears to be cost-effective compared with TOL or TAM monotherapy or PBO in male patients with LUTS.",2012-01-08718,22332704,J Med Econ,Bram G Verheggen,2012,15 /,586-600,Yes,22332704,"Bram G Verheggen; Richard Lee; Michelle M Lieuw On; Maarten J Treur; Marc F Botteman; Steven A Kaplan; Jeffrey N Trocio; Estimating the quality-of-life impact and cost-effectiveness of alpha-blocker and anti-muscarinic combination treatment in men with lower urinary tract symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia and overactive bladder, J Med Econ, ; 15 ():1369-6998; 586-600",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tolterodine extended release (TOL) + tamsulosin (TAM) vs. Pacebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,41 Years,Male,Full,52 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,4508,United Kingdom,2010,8260.11
9485,Rufinamide: a pharmacoeconomic profile of its use as adjunctive therapy in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,"Rufinamide (Inovelon?), a triazole derivative, is an oral antiepileptic drug approved in the EU as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients aged =4 years. The efficacy of oral rufinamide as adjunctive therapy in patients with LGS uncontrolled on one to three concomitant antiepileptic drugs was demonstrated in a pivotal, 12-week, randomized, double-blind trial. Rufinamide significantly reduced the 28-day frequency of both drop attacks and total seizures compared with placebo, and significantly increased the proportions of patients experiencing a =50% reduction in each seizure frequency. A significantly higher proportion of rufinamide than placebo recipients recorded an improvement in seizure severity at the end of treatment. Reductions in the frequency of drop attacks and total seizures were maintained in a long-term (up to 3 years), open-label extension study. Oral rufinamide was generally well tolerated in patients with LGS. Somnolence and vomiting were the most common adverse events occurring more frequently with rufinamide than with placebo. Two pharmacoeconomic analyses, using decision-analysis models with 3-month cycles over a time horizon of 3 years, assessed the cost effectiveness and cost utility, respectively, of rufinamide compared with topiramate and lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy in patients with LGS from the perspective of the UK NHS. The cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that rufinamide would be associated with incremental costs of ?62 (drop attacks) or ?2151 (total seizures) per 1% increase in the number of patients achieving a >50% reduction in seizure frequency over 3 years. The cost-utility analysis predicted that the incremental cost per QALY gained for rufinamide compared with the next less-costly and undominated therapy would be more than 5-fold higher than the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold range in the UK. In conclusion, the available pharmacoeconomic data indicate that rufinamide is more effective, but more expensive, than alternative adjunctive therapies approved for use in patients with LGS in the UK. Rufinamide would appear to be a cost-effective alternative to topiramate. Although rufinamide exceeds conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds when compared with lamotrigine, it may still be considered a valuable treatment option for a devastating orphan disease such as LGS.",2012-01-08719,22332960,Pharmacoeconomics,Paul L McCormack,2011,30 /,247-56,Yes,22332960,"Paul L McCormack; Rufinamide: a pharmacoeconomic profile of its use as adjunctive therapy in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 30 ():1179-2027; 247-56",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adjunctive therapy with oral topiramate vs. Adjunctive therapy with lamotrigine,Not Stated,Not Stated,4 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.50,3.50,-26283.33,United Kingdom,2007,-65680.99

Both TAVI and AVR were cost-effective compared to medical management. In the reference case (age 80 years, the perioperative TAVI and AVR mortality was 6.9% vs 9.8%, and annual mortality was 21% vs 24%), the utility of TAVI was greater than that of AVR (1.78 vs 1.72 quality-adjusted life years) and the lifetime cost of TAVI exceeded that of AVR ($59,503 vs $56,339).

A third party payer perspective was adopted. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken.All scenarios would be considered highly cost-effective compared with no screening. The lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER vs no screening euro 589 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained) was found for FSIG, followed by FIT euro 1696) and gFOBT (euro 4428); gFOBT was dominated. Compared with FSIG, FIT was associated with greater gains in QALYs and reductions in lifetime cancer incidence and mortality, but was more costly, required considerably more colonoscopies and resulted in more complications. Results were robust to variations in parameter estimates.Population-based screening based on FIT is expected to result in greater health gains than a policy of gFOBT (with reflex FIT) or once-only FSIG, but would require significantly more colonoscopy resources and result in more individuals experiencing adverse effects. Weighing these advantages and disadvantages presents a considerable challenge to policy makers.",2012-01-08737,22343624,Br J Cancer,L Sharp,2012,106 /,805-16,No,22343624,"L Sharp; L Tilson; S Whyte; A O'Ceilleachair; C Walsh; C Usher; P Tappenden; J Chilcott; A Staines; M Barry; H Comber; Cost-effectiveness of population-based screening for colorectal cancer: a comparison of guaiac-based faecal occult blood testing, faecal immunochemical testing and flexible sigmoidoscopy, Br J Cancer, ; 106 ():0007-0920; 805-16",QALY,Ireland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biennial reflex faecal immunochemical tests (FIT) among 65-74 year individuals vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,1698,Euro,2008,3005.68

The three- stage model included cardiovascular event prevention simulating the 4 years of JUPITER, initial prevention beyond the trial, and subsequent cardiovascular event prevention. A Swedish health care payer perspective (direct costs only) was modeled for a lifetime horizon, with 2008/2009 as the costing period. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed.The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with rosuvastatin 20 mg over simvastatin or atorvastatin 40 mg ranged from SEK88,113 (rosuvastatin 20 mg versus simvastatin 40 mg; Framingham risk =30%; net avoidance of 34 events/1000 patients) to SEK497,542 (versus atorvastatin 40 mg: Framingham risk =20%; net avoidance of 11 events/1000 patients) over a lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of SEK500,000/QALY, rosuvastatin 20 mg would be cost-effective for approximately 75%-85% of simulations relative to atorvastatin or simvastatin 40 mg.
