24701,"Infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab and tofacitinib in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: comparative cost-effectiveness study in Poland","BACKGROUND: Current management of ulcerative colitis (UC) is aimed to treat active disease and to maintain remission. For patients in whom conventional treatment is no longer effective, biological or small molecule therapy may be an option. The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of induction and maintenance treatment up to 1?year of UC with infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA), golimumab, vedolizumab (VDZ) and tofacitinib (TFB) compared with standard of care (SoC) in Poland. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree/Markov model was used to estimate the expected costs and effects of four biologics, TFB and placebo in patients with the diagnosis of moderate to severe UC who had an inadequate response, lost response, or were intolerant to a conventional therapy. Prior exposure to anti-TNF was considered. At the beginning of the maintenance phase, the decision to continue biological therapy was determined by the achievement of response at the end of induction. Efficacy data were obtained from a network meta-analysis using placebo as the common comparator. Costs were presented in 2018 Polish zloty (PLN) and outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The analysis was performed from the Polish public payer''s perspective and lifetime horizon was set. RESULTS: In anti-TNF naïve, IFX and VDZ were characterized by the most favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICURs) compared with SoC, PLN211,250.78 and PLN361,694.61/QALY (€49,589.38 and €84,904.84/QALY), respectively. In anti-TNF-exposed population the most effective treatment was TFB. Both ADA and VDZ were more effective than SoC; however, ICUR values were much above the cost-effectiveness threshold. The incorporation of biosimilars reversed the ranking of treatments in relation to the growing ICUR. CONCLUSION: Although ICUR values for all biological therapies exceeded the acceptability threshold in Poland, for anti-TNF-naïve UC patients IFX and for anti-TNF-exposed UC patients VDZ are currently the most cost-effective alternatives.",2020-01-34609,32922513,Therap Adv Gastroenterol,Pawel Petryszyn,2020,13 /,1756284820941179,No,32922513,"Pawel Petryszyn; Pawel Ekk-Cierniakowski; Grzegorz Zurakowski; Infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab and tofacitinib in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis: comparative cost-effectiveness study in Poland, Therap Adv Gastroenterol, 2020; 13():1756-283X; 1756284820941179",QALY,Poland,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",adalimumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard/usual care,"moderate, severe ulcerative colitis, prior anti tumor necrosis factor exposure",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,3.50,689441.39,Poland,2018,197025.56

24705,Cost-Effectiveness of Volar Locking Plate Compared with Augmented External Fixation for Displaced Intra-Articular Wrist Fractures,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating displaced, intra-articular distal radial fractures with volar locking plate fixation compared with augmented external fixation. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted alongside a randomized, clinical trial comparing 2 surgical interventions for intra-articular distal radial fractures. One hundred and sixty-six patients were allocated to either volar locking plate fixation (84 patients) or external fixation (82 patients) and were followed for 2 years. Health-related quality of life was assessed with the EuroQol-5 Dimensions and was used to calculate patients'' quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Resource use was identified prospectively at the patient level at all follow-up intervals. Costs were estimated with use of both a health-care perspective and a societal perspective. Results were expressed in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and uncertainty was assessed with use of bootstrapping methods. RESULTS: The average QALY value was equivalent between the groups (1.70463 for the volar locking plate group and 1.70726 for the external fixation group, yielding a nonsignificant difference of -0.00263 QALY). Health-care costs were equal between the groups, with a nonsignificant difference of &OV0556;52 (p = 0.8) in favor of external fixation. However, the external fixation group had a higher loss of productivity due to absence from work (5.5 weeks in the volar locking plate group compared with 9.2 weeks for the external fixation group; p = 0.02). Consequently, the societal costs were higher for the external fixation group compared with the volar locking plate group (&OV0556;18,037 compared with &OV0556;12,567, representing a difference of &OV0556;5,470; p = 0.04) in favor of the volar locking plate group. Uncertainty analyses showed that there is indifference regarding which method to recommend from a health-care perspective, with volar locking plate treatment and external fixation having a 47% and 53% likelihood of being cost-effective, respectively. From the societal perspective, volar locking plate treatment had a 90% likelihood of being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: External fixation was less cost-effective than volar locking plate treatment for distal radial fractures from a societal perspective, primarily because patients managed with external fixation had a longer absence from work.

24707,Public Health and Cost Benefits of Successful Reperfusion After Thrombectomy for Stroke,"Background and Purpose- The benefit that endovascular thrombectomy offers to patients with stroke with large vessel occlusions depends strongly on reperfusion grade as defined by the expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) scale. Our aim was to determine the lifetime health and cost consequences of the quality of reperfusion for patients, healthcare systems, and society. Methods- A Markov model estimated lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and lifetime costs of endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke based on eTICI grades. The analysis was performed over a lifetime horizon in a United States setting, adopting healthcare and societal perspectives. The reference case analysis was conducted for stroke at 65 years of age. National health and cost consequences of improved eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rates were estimated. Input parameters were based on best available evidence. Results- Lifetime QALYs increased for every grade of improved reperfusion (median QALYs for eTICI 0/1: 2.62; eTICI 2a: 3.46; eTICI 2b: 5.42; eTICI 2c: 5.99; eTICI 3: 6.73). Achieving eTICI 3 over eTICI 2b reperfusion resulted on average in 1.31 incremental QALYs as well as healthcare and societal cost savings of $10 327 and $20 224 per patient. A 10% increase in the eTICI 2c/3 reperfusion rate of all annually endovascular thrombectomy-treated patients with stroke in the United States is estimated to yield additional 3656 QALYs and save $21.0 million and $36.8 million for the healthcare system and society, respectively.

24717,Cost utility analysis of tisagenlecleucel vs salvage chemotherapy in the treatment of relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from Singapore's healthcare system perspective,"BACKGROUND: Patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (r/r DLBCL) have limited treatment options and poor prognoses. Tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown early promise in improving survival outcomes, but at a high upfront cost. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel versus salvage chemotherapy for treating patients with r/r DLBCL who have failed at least 2 lines of systemic therapies. METHODS: A hybrid decision tree and three-state partitioned survival model (progression-free (PF), progressive disease and death) was developed from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Survival curves from JULIET trial and CORAL-1 extension study were extrapolated beyond trial period over a 15-year time horizon to estimate the underlying progression-free survival and overall survival parametric distributions for both arms. Health state utilities were retrieved from the literature, and direct costs were sourced from public healthcare institutions in Singapore. One-way probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: Compared with salvage chemotherapy, tisagenlecleucel was associated with a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) US$508,530 (S$686,516) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained and US$320,200 (S$432,269) per life year (LY) gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the ICER was most sensitive to time horizon, PF utility and cost of tisagenlecleucel. Scenario analyses confirmed that the ICERs remained high under favorable assumptions and substantial price reduction was required to reduce the ICER. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed tisagenlecleucel use in r/r DLBCL patients who failed at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapies was associated with exceedingly high ICER, which is unlikely to represent good use of healthcare resources.

Methods: A Markov model was built to estimate the cost and effectiveness of nivolumab plus ipilimumab vs. chemotherapy as the first-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC based on outcomes data from the CheckMate 227 trial. We calculated the cost and health outcomes at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $150,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) in populations with different programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels (=50, =1, and <1%) or a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) (=10 mutations per megabase).

METHODS: This study established a partition survival model for three health states, metastasis probability, and safety data based on the CASPIAN clinical trial. The health utility value was mainly derived from the published literature. Only direct medical costs were considered. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide increased QALY by 0.220 compared to that observed with platinum-etoposide only. The cost increased by $78,198.75 and the incremental cost per QALY increased by $355,448.86. One-way and probability sensitivity analyses indicated that the model parameters varied within a limited range and had no significant effect on the results.

24722,Cost-effectiveness of new antiviral treatments for non-genotype 1 hepatitis C virus infection in China: a societal perspective,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) among patients with non-genotype 1 for the eradication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in China. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for DAAs and pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-RBV) from a societal perspective. The model inputs were derived from the literature, a patient survey, HCV expert opinions and a specialised drug price database available in China. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate the model robustness and calculate reasonable prices of DAAs. RESULTS: For patients infected with HCV genotype 2, the pan-genotypic regimen sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) was the most cost-effective strategy compared with PEG-RBV, with an ICER of US$5653/QALY. For genotype 3, the combination of sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir (SOF-DCV) was the most cost-effective approach, with an ICER of US$3314/QALY. All DAA regimens for genotype 6 were cost-saving, and sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF-RBV) was the optimal regimen. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the ICERs were most sensitive to the utility values, discount rate and drug costs.

We aimed to determine the most cost-effective antithrombotic therapy in older adults with atrial fibrillation who are at high risk for falls. METHODS: We conducted a mathematical modelling study from July 2019 to March 2020 based on the Ontario, Canada, health care system. We derived the base-case age, sex and fall risk distribution from a published cohort of older adults at risk for falls, and the bleeding and stroke risk parameters from an atrial fibrillation trial population. Using a probabilistic microsimulation Markov decision model, we calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. Cost data were adjusted for inflation to 2018 values. The analysis used the Ontario public payer perspective with a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: In our model, the most cost-effective antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation in older patients at risk for falls was apixaban, with an ICER of $8517 per QALY gained (5.86 QALYs at $92 056) over ASA. It was a dominant strategy over warfarin and the other antithrombotic agents. There was moderate uncertainty in cost-effectiveness ranking, with apixaban as the preferred choice in 66% of model iterations (given willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY gained); edoxaban, 30 mg, was preferred in 31% of iterations. Sensitivity analysis across ranges of age, bleeding risk and fall risk still favoured apixaban over the other medications.

We aimed to determine the most cost-effective antithrombotic therapy in older adults with atrial fibrillation who are at high risk for falls. METHODS: We conducted a mathematical modelling study from July 2019 to March 2020 based on the Ontario, Canada, health care system. We derived the base-case age, sex and fall risk distribution from a published cohort of older adults at risk for falls, and the bleeding and stroke risk parameters from an atrial fibrillation trial population. Using a probabilistic microsimulation Markov decision model, we calculated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for each of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), warfarin, apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban and edoxaban. Cost data were adjusted for inflation to 2018 values. The analysis used the Ontario public payer perspective with a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: In our model, the most cost-effective antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation in older patients at risk for falls was apixaban, with an ICER of $8517 per QALY gained (5.86 QALYs at $92 056) over ASA.

24738,Cost-effectiveness analysis of double low-dose budesonide and low-dose budesonide plus montelukast among pediatric patients with persistent asthma receiving Step 3 treatment in China,"AIMS: For children aged 1-5 years with persistent asthma, double low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are recommended as the preferred Step 3 treatment and low-dose ICS plus leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA) as an alternative. Budesonide inhalation suspension (0.5?mg daily) and montelukast (4.0?mg daily) are commonly used low-dose ICS and LTRA, respectively, among children in China. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of double low-dose budesonide vs. low-dose budesonide plus montelukast from a Chinese healthcare payer''s perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed with four health states (i.e. no exacerbation, mild exacerbation, moderate-to-severe exacerbation, and death). Transition probabilities were estimated based on exacerbation rates, case-fatality of hospitalized patients due to exacerbation, and natural mortality. Treatment adherence was considered and assumed to impact both drug costs and exacerbation rates. Costs (in 2019 Chinese Yuan [¥]) included drug costs and exacerbation management costs. Cost inputs and utilities for each health state were obtained from a public database and the literature. In-depth interviews were conducted with a health economics expert to validate the model, and a clinical expert to verify inputs and assumptions related to clinical practice. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated over a year. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with low-dose budesonide plus montelukast, double low-dose budesonide was associated with lower costs (¥1,534 vs. ¥2,327), fewer exacerbation events (0.43 vs. 1.67) and slightly better QALYs (0.98 vs. 0.97). Sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the results and the generalizability of findings across geographic regions in China. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that double low-dose budesonide is a dominant Step 3 treatment strategy compared with low-dose budesonide plus montelukast for patients aged 1-5 years with persistent asthma in China.",2020-01-34670,32991222,J Med Econ,Xiaoling Wang,2020,23 / 12,1630-1639,Yes,32991222,"Xiaoling Wang; Honghao Fang; Kunling Shen; Tianyi Liu; Jipan Xie; Yuantao Liu; Peibei Wu; Yilin Chen; Jia Zhong; Eric Wu; Wei Zhou; Bin Wu; Cost-effectiveness analysis of double low-dose budesonide and low-dose budesonide plus montelukast among pediatric patients with persistent asthma receiving Step 3 treatment in China, J Med Econ, 2020 Dec; 23(12):1369-6998; 1630-1639",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,budesonide vs. low dose budesonide (0.5mg daily) + montelukast,"persistent disease, receiving Step 3 treatment",5 Years,1 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-79300,China,2019,-11620.9

DESIGN: Economic evaluation using a decision-analytical model. SETTING: Thailand. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with refractory sJIA who were =2 years old. METHODS: The use of tocilizumab as an add-on therapy to standard treatment was compared with standard treatment alone. A simulated health state transition model was used to estimate the lifetime costs and health outcomes from a societal perspective. Direct medical costs were collected from tertiary hospital databases while direct non-medical costs were derived from interviews. Health-related quality of life (QoL) was measured using the proxy version of three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L). Future costs and outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3%. The base case population was patients aged 9.41 years old at refractory disease onset. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in US dollar (USD). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to investigate parameter uncertainty. The 5-year budget impact was estimated from a governmental perspective. RESULTS: The ICER of standard treatment plus tocilizumab was US$35?799 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained compared with standard treatment alone, which was not cost-effective at the threshold of US$5128 per QALY gained. The estimated 5?years budget impact was approximately US$4.8?million. CONCLUSIONS: The use of standard treatment plus tocilizumab was not cost-effective in the Thai context, which has limited data. However, there is currently no second-line treatment for refractory sJIA in the Thai National List of Essential Medicines; thus, patients must receive higher doses of standard treatment which can cause many side effects.

24741,Cost-effectiveness analysis of ixekizumab versus secukinumab in patients with psoriatic arthritis and concomitant moderate-to-severe psoriasis in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System (NHS) comparing ixekizumab versus secukinumab. DESIGN: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon and monthly cycles was developed based on the York model. Four health states were included: a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) induction period of 12 or 16?weeks, maintenance therapy, best supportive care (BSC) and death. Treatment response was assessed based on both Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) and =90% improvement in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index score (PASI90). At the end of the induction period, responders transitioned to maintenance therapy. Non-responders and patients who discontinued maintenance therapy transitioned to BSC. Clinical efficacy data were derived from a network meta-analysis. Health utilities were generated by applying a regression analysis to Psoriasis Area Severity Index and Health Assessment Questionnaire?Disability Index scores collected in the ixekizumab SPIRIT studies. Results were subject to extensive sensitivity and scenario analysis. SETTING: Spanish NHS. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of bDMARD-naïve patients with psoriatic arthritis and concomitant moderate-to-severe psoriasis was modelled. INTERVENTIONS: Ixekizumab and secukinumab. RESULTS: Ixekizumab performed favourably over secukinumab in the base-case analysis, although cost savings and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains were modest. Total costs were €153?901 compared with €156?559 for secukinumab (difference -€2658). Total QALYs were 9.175 vs 9.082 (difference 0.093). Base-case results were most sensitive to the annual bDMARD discontinuation rate and the modification of PsARC and PASI90 response to ixekizumab or secukinumab. CONCLUSION: Ixekizumab provided more QALYs at a lower cost than secukinumab, with differences being on a relatively small scale. Sensitivity analysis showed that base-case results were generally robust to changes in most input parameters.

24745,Assessing the cost-utility of preferentially administering Heplisav-B vaccine to certain populations,"Vaccination is the primary strategy to prevent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the United States. Prior to 2017, most standard hepatitis B vaccine schedules required 3 doses over 6 months. Heplisav-B, approved in 2017, is administered in 2 doses over a 1 month time period but has a higher per-dose cost ($115.75 per dose compared to $57.25 per Engerix-B dose, costs as of June 1, 2019). We aimed to assess the cost-utility of providing the two-dose Heplisav-B vaccine compared to a three-dose Engerix-B vaccine among adult populations currently recommended for vaccination against hepatitis B. We used a decision-tree model with microsimulation and a Markov disease progression process to assess the cost-utility separately for the following populations: adults with diabetes, obesity, chronic kidney disease, HIV; non-responders to previous hepatitis B vaccination; older adults; and persons who inject drugs (PWID). We modeled epidemiologic outcomes (incident HBV infections, sequelae and related deaths), costs (2019 USD) and benefits (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) and compared them across strategies. Sensitivity analyses assessed the cost-utility at varying estimates of Heplisav-B efficacy.

24752,Early health economic modelling for a treatment candidate in hidradenitis suppurativa,"AIMS: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin condition causing inflammatory lesions, pain, scarring, and impaired mobility. Treatment options are limited and often lack success implying the need for additional/improved treatments. This research aimed to estimate the potential economic value of a treatment candidate, explore drivers of cost-effectiveness, and highlight economic evidence requirements for successful future value assessments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An early cost-effectiveness model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness (cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained) of a treatment candidate compared against the only authorized biologic, adalimumab, for moderate to severe HS, from a UK National Health Service and Personal Social Service perspective. A targeted literature review of clinical and economic references and previous health technology assessments (HTA) was performed for development and validation of the early economic model used to present sensitivity analyses accompanying the base case cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Base case results revealed the candidate not to be cost-effective compared to adalimumab when considering a formal cost-effectiveness threshold of £30,000 per QALY gained. Scenario- and threshold analyses highlighted that reducing dosing or drug price by half improved the cost-effectiveness of the candidate. Cost-effectiveness was highly sensitive to health states'' utility values, treatment discontinuation, and resource utilization, in line with existing HTA evidence. The paucity of economic studies and uncertainties around the candidate presented methodological constraints that were addressed through sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Key costs and health effects drivers were highlighted to contextualize under which circumstances a treatment candidate for moderate to severe HS would reach acceptable cost-effectiveness levels. This early economic evaluation suggested promising economic perspectives for treatment candidates in HS. Exploring novel ways to use clinical endpoints to simulate the patient pathway and clinically meaningful treatment achievements in future research will facilitate the value demonstration of candidates in disease areas with high unmet care need.",2020-01-34692,33084453,J Med Econ,Damon Willems,2020,23 / 12,1516-1524,Yes,33084453,"Damon Willems; Mata Charokopou; Silvia M A A Evers; Mickaël Hiligsmann; Early health economic modelling for a treatment candidate in hidradenitis suppurativa, J Med Econ, 2020 Dec; 23(12):1369-6998; 1516-1524",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,hypothetical biologic intervention vs. Standard/Usual Care- adalimumab,"moderate to severe disease, inadequate response to conventional treatment",36 Years,36 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,132952,United Kingdom,2019,171865.23
24753,Exploring the Cost Effectiveness of Shared Decision Making for Choosing between Disease-Modifying Drugs for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis in the Netherlands: A State Transition Model,"BACKGROUND: Up to 31% of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) discontinue treatment with disease-modifying drug (DMD) within the first year, and of the patients who do continue, about 40% are nonadherent. Shared decision making may decrease nonadherence and discontinuation rates, but evidence in the context of RRMS is limited. Shared decision making may, however, come at additional costs. This study aimed to explore the potential cost-effectiveness of shared decision making for RRMS in comparison with usual care, from a (limited) societal perspective over a lifetime. METHODS: An exploratory economic evaluation was conducted by adapting a previously developed state transition model that evaluates the cost-effectiveness of a range of DMDs for RRMS in comparison with the best supportive care. Three potential effects of shared decision making were explored: 1) a change in the initial DMD chosen, 2) a decrease in the patient''s discontinuation in using the DMD, and 3) an increase in adherence to the DMD. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of a scenario that combined the 3 effects were conducted. RESULTS: Each effect separately and the 3 effects combined resulted in higher quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs due to the increased utilization of DMD. A decrease in discontinuation of DMDs influenced the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) most. The combined scenario resulted in an ICER of €17,875 per QALY gained. The ICER was sensitive to changes in several parameters. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that shared decision making for DMDs could potentially be cost-effective, especially if shared decision making would help to decrease treatment discontinuation. Our results, however, may depend on the assumed effects on treatment choice, persistence, and adherence, which are actually largely unknown.",2020-01-34696,33174513,Med Decis Making,Ingrid E H Kremer,2020,40 / 8,1003-1019,No,33174513,"Ingrid E H Kremer; Mickael Hiligsmann; Josh Carlson; Marita Zimmermann; Peter J Jongen; Silvia M A A Evers; Svenja Petersohn; Xavier G L V Pouwels; Nick Bansback; Exploring the Cost Effectiveness of Shared Decision Making for Choosing between Disease-Modifying Drugs for Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis in the Netherlands: A State Transition Model, Med Decis Making, 2020 Nov; 40(8):0272-989X; 1003-1019",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Care Delivery,shared decision making vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard/usual care,no prior experience with disease modifying drugs,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,17875,Euro,2018,21770.85

METHODS: In the prospective, multicenter, cohort study of imaging selection study (SELECT), large core was defined as computed tomography (CT) ASPECTS<6?or computed tomography perfusion (CTP) ischemic core volume (rCBF<30%) =50?cc. A Markov model estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EVT compared with medical management (MM) over lifetime. The willingness to pay (WTP) per QALY was set at $50?000 and $100?000 and the net monetary benefits (NMB) were calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC) for EVT were assessed in SELECT and other pivotal trials. RESULTS: From 361 patients enrolled in SELECT, 105 had large core on CT or CTP (EVT 62, MM 43). 19 (31%) EVT vs 6 (14%) MM patients achieved modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2 (OR 3.27, 95%?CI 1.11 to 9.62, P=0.03) with a shift towards better mRS (cOR 2.12, 95%?CI 1.05 to 4.31, P=0.04). Over the projected lifetime of patients presenting with large core, EVT led to incremental costs of $33?094 and a gain of 1.34 QALYs per patient, resulting in ICER of $24?665 per QALY. EVT has a higher NMB compared with MM at lower (EVT -$42 747, MM -$76 740) and upper (EVT $155 041, MM $57 134) WTP thresholds. PSA confirmed the results and CEAC showed 77% and 92% acceptability of EVT at the WTP of $50?000 and $100 000, respectively. EVT was associated with an increment of $29?225 in societal costs. The pivotal EVT trials (HERMES, DAWN, DEFUSE 3) were dominant in a sensitivity analysis at the same inputs, with societal cost-savings of $37 901, $86?164 and $22?501 and a gain of 1.62, 2.36 and 2.21 QALYs, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a non-randomized prospective cohort study, EVT resulted in better outcomes in large core patients with higher QALYs, NMB and high cost-effectiveness acceptability rates at current WTP thresholds. Randomized trials are needed to confirm these results.

24755,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Biological Signature DCISionRT Use for DCIS Treatment,"BACKGROUND: Currently it remains difficult to identify patients most likely to benefit from radiotherapy (RT) for ductal carcinoma-in-situ (DCIS), thus leading to wide variation in practice patterns. The genomic risk assessment tool DCISionRT (PreludeDX) has been validated to prognosticate recurrence risk and predict RT benefit. We aimed to study the cost-effectiveness analysis comparing DCIS treatments based on DCISionRT testing to traditional clinicopathologic risk factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov state transition model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing breast-conserving surgery with or without RT using DCISionRT testing vs. traditional clinicopathologic risk factors. Clinical parameters were obtained from clinical trial data and cross-validation studies. Cost data were based on 2019 Medicare reimbursement. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained comparing DCIS treatments using DCISionRT testing to traditional clinicopathologic risk factors and evaluated with a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$100,000 per QALY gained. To account for uncertainty, 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Base case analysis showed that DCIS management using DCISionRT testing was a cost-effective strategy, resulting in an ICER of $74,331 per QALY gained compared to clinicopathology-based treatment. Model results were sensitive to a variation of the proportion of genomic-high, low-risk patients receiving RT in DCISionRT testing strategy, and changes in DCISionRT testing cost. CONCLUSION: DCISionRT testing could potentially be a cost-effective strategy compared to traditional decision making for DCIS treatments, optimizing RT benefit based on an accurate recurrence risk assessment.",2020-01-34707,33218957,Clin Breast Cancer,Hayeon Kim,2020,/,,No,33218957,"Hayeon Kim; John A Vargo; Kenneth J Smith; Sushil Beriwal; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Biological Signature DCISionRT Use for DCIS Treatment, Clin Breast Cancer, 2020 Oct 24; ():1526-8209",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,genomic risk assessment tool dcisionrt vs. Standard/Usual Care- traditional clinicopathologic risk factors,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,74331,United States,2019,75248.01
24756,Impact of China's Low Centralized Medicine Procurement Prices on the Cost-Effectiveness of Statins for the Primary Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease,"BACKGROUND: Statin medications reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). China''s new central government medicine procurement policy lowered statin prices by five-fold or more, which may impact the cost-effectiveness of statin therapy. OBJECTIVE: To explore the impact of China''s 2019 centralized medicine procurement policy on the cost-effectiveness of statins treatment for primary ASCVD prevention. METHODS: A microsimulation decision tree analytic model was built using individual participant data from ASCVD-free adults aged 35-64 years (n = 21,265) in the China Multi-provincial Cohort Study. ASCVD incidence, costs (2019 Int$), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over a 10-year period from health-care sector and societal perspectives were estimated. Effect and cost-effectiveness of low-dose statins (equivalent potency regimens of simvastatin 20 mg/day, atorvastatin 10 mg/day, or rosuvastatin 5 mg/day) and moderate-dose (double low dose) statins therapy were simulated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of statin treatment was compared with no treatment by category of 10-year ASCVD risk. New lower prices of statins were from the centralized procurement policy bid-winning announcement file. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses quantified model uncertainty. RESULTS: Low-dose statins interventions reduced 10-year ASCVD incidence by 4.1%, 9.7%, and 15.5% among people with low, moderate, and high risk comparing to no treatment. Lowering statin prices to the 2019 central government procurement policy level could lower the ICER of low-dose statins treatment for high-risk people from Int$ 141,000 to Int$ 51,300 per QALY gained from health-care sector perspective. Moderate-dose statin treatment lowered the ICER compared with the low-dose statins treatment in each ASCVD risk category (Int$ 43,100 vs. Int$ 51,300 per QALY gained from the health-care sector perspective for high risk people).

24762,Bariatric surgery for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin: Clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness analyses,"BACKGROUND: Although bariatric surgery is well established as an effective treatment for patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), there exists reluctance to increase its availability for patients with severe T2DM. The aims of this study were to examine the impact of bariatric surgery on T2DM resolution in patients with obesity and T2DM requiring insulin (T2DM-Ins) using data from a national database and to develop a health economic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgery in this cohort when compared to best medical treatment (BMT). METHODS AND FINDINGS: Clinical data from the National Bariatric Surgical Registry (NBSR), a comprehensive database of bariatric surgery in the United Kingdom, were extracted to analyse outcomes of patients with obesity and T2DM-Ins who underwent primary bariatric surgery between 2009 and 2017. Outcomes for this group were combined with data sourced from a comprehensive literature review in order to develop a state-transition microsimulation model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery versus BMT for patients over a 5-year time horizon. The main outcome measure for the clinical study was insulin cessation at 1-year post-surgery: relative risks (RR) summarising predictive factors were determined, unadjusted, and after adjusting for variables including age, initial body mass index (BMI), duration of T2DM, and weight loss. Main outcome measures for the economic evaluation were total costs, total quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP£20,000. A total of 2,484 patients were eligible for inclusion, of which 1,847 had 1-year follow-up data (mean age of 51 years, mean initial BMI 47.2 kg/m2, and 64% female). 67% of patients no longer required insulin at 1-year postoperatively: these rates persisted for 4 years. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) was associated with a higher rate of insulin cessation (71.7%) than sleeve gastrectomy (SG; 64.5%; RR 0.92, confidence interval (CI) 0.86-0.99) and adjustable gastric band (AGB; 33.6%; RR 0.45, CI 0.34-0.60; p < 0.001). When adjusted for percentage total weight loss and demographic variables, insulin cessation following surgery was comparable for RYGB and SG (RR 0.97, CI 0.90-1.04), with AGB having the lowest cessation rates (RR 0.55, CI 0.40-0.74; p < 0.001). Over 5 years, bariatric surgery was cost saving compared to BMT (total cost GBP£22,057 versus GBP£26,286 respectively, incremental difference GBP£4,229). This was due to lower treatment costs as well as reduced diabetes-related complications costs and increased health benefits. Limitations of this study include loss to follow-up of patients within the NBSR dataset and that the time horizon for the economic analysis is limited to 5 years. In addition, the study reflects current medical and surgical treatment regimens for this cohort of patients, which may change. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that in patients with obesity and T2DM-Ins, bariatric surgery was associated with high rates of postoperative cessation of insulin therapy, which is, in turn, a major driver of overall reductions in direct healthcare cost. Our findings suggest that a strategy utilising bariatric surgery for patients with obesity and T2DM-Ins is cost saving to the national healthcare provider (National Health Service (NHS)) over a 5-year time horizon.",2020-01-34713,33285553,PLoS Med,Emma Rose McGlone,2020,17 / 12,e1003228,No,33285553,"Emma Rose McGlone; Iain Carey; Vladica Velickovic; Prem Chana; Kamal Mahawar; Rachel L Batterham; James Hopkins; Peter Walton; Robin Kinsman; James Byrne; Shaw Somers; David Kerrigan; Vinod Menon; Cynthia Borg; Ahmed Ahmed; Bruno Sgromo; Chandra Cheruvu; Gul Bano; Catherine Leonard; Howard Thom; Carel W Le Roux; Marcus Reddy; Richard Welbourn; Peter Small; Omar A Khan; Bariatric surgery for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus requiring insulin: Clinical outcome and cost-effectiveness analyses, PLoS Med, 2020 Dec; 17(12):1549-1676; e1003228",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Surgical,bariatric surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- best medical treatment + nutritional counseling,"Includes Republic of Ireland, using insulin pre-operatively, follow-up appointment between 6 and 24 months post-operatively",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,-140966.67,United Kingdom,2018,-194146.12
24763,Economic Evaluation of Catheter Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients with Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction,"BACKGROUND: Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction may improve survival and other cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic Markov model to estimate the costs and benefits of catheter ablation and medical management in patients with symptomatic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction =35%) and atrial fibrillation over a lifetime horizon. Evidence from the published literature informed the model inputs, including clinical effectiveness data from meta-analyses. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. A 3% discount rate was applied to both future costs and benefits. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio assessed from the US health care sector perspective. RESULTS: Catheter ablation was associated with 6.47 (95% CI, 5.89-6.93) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a total cost of $105?657 (95% CI, $55?311-$191?934; 2018 US dollars), compared with 5.30 (95% CI, 5.20-5.39) QALYs and $63?040 (95% CI, $37?624-$102?260) for medical management. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for catheter ablation compared with medical management was $38?496 (95% CI, $5583-$117?510) per QALY gained. Model inputs with the greatest variation on incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimates were the cost of ablation and the effect of catheter ablation on mortality reduction. When assuming a more conservative estimate of the treatment effect of catheter ablation on mortality (hazard ratio of 0.86), the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $74?403 per QALY gained. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000 per QALY gained, atrial fibrillation ablation was found to be economically favorable compared with medical management in 95% of simulations.

This study examined the cost-effectiveness of ceritinib vs. crizotinib in the first-line treatment of ALK?+?NSCLC from a HK healthcare service provider''s or government''s perspective. METHODS: Costs and effectiveness of first-line ceritinib vs. crizotinib over a 20-year time horizon was evaluated using a partitioned survival model with three health states (stable disease, progressed disease, and death). The efficacy data for ceritinib were obtained from a phase 3 trial comparing ceritinib with chemotherapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ASCEND-4) and extrapolated using parametric survival models. Long-term survival associated with crizotinib were estimated using hazard ratio of crizotinib vs. ceritinib obtained from matching-adjusted indirect comparison based on ASCEND-4 and PROFILE 1014 trials. Drug acquisition, administration, adverse events costs, and medical costs associated with each health state were obtained from public sources and converted to 2018 US Dollars. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY) gained were estimated for ceritinib vs. crizotinib. RESULTS: The base case results showed that ceritinib was associated with 3.22 QALYs, 4.51 LYs, and total costs of $157,581 over 20 years. Patients receiving crizotinib had 2.68 QALYs, 3.85 LYs, and $150,424 total costs over the same time horizon. The incremental cost per QALY gained for ceritinib vs crizotinib was $13,343. Results were robust to deterministic sensitivity analyses in most scenarios.

24765,Cost-effectiveness of the Da Qing diabetes prevention program: A modelling study,"OBJECTIVE: The Da Qing Diabetes Prevention program (DQDP) was a randomized lifestyle modification intervention conducted in 1986 for the prevention and control of type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. The current study estimated long-term cost-effectiveness of the program based on the health utilities from the Chinese population. METHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo model was developed to estimate the impact of the intervention from the healthcare system perspective. The analysis was run over 30-year and lifetime periods and costs were estimated respectively as health management service costs. Baseline characteristics and intervention effects were assessed from the DQDP. Utilities and costs were generated from relevant literature. The outcome measures were program cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the intervention. Sensitivity analyses and threshold analyses were performed. RESULTS: Using a 30-year horizon, the intervention strategy was cost-saving and was associated with better health outcomes (increase of 0.74 QALYs per intervention participant). Using a lifetime horizon, the intervention strategy was cost-saving and was associated with additional 1.44 QALYs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the overall ICER was most strongly influenced by the hazard ratio of cardiovascular disease event.

24767,Cost-Effectiveness Study of Initial Imaging Selection in Acute Ischemic Stroke Care,"PURPOSE: National guidelines recommend prompt identification of candidates for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treatment, requiring timely neuroimaging with CT and/or MRI. CT is often preferred because of its widespread availability and rapid acquisition. Despite higher diagnostic accuracy of MRI, it commonly involves complex workflows that could potentially cause treatment time delays. The purpose of this study was to analyze the impact on outcomes of imaging utilization before treatment decisions at comprehensive stroke centers for patients presenting with suspected AIS in the anterior circulation with last-known-well-to-arrival time 0 to 24 hours. METHODS: A decision simulation model based on the American Heart Association''s recommendations for AIS care pathways was developed from a health care perspective to compare initial imaging strategies: (1) stepwise-CT: noncontrast CT (NCCT) at the time of presentation, with CT angiography (CTA) ± CT perfusion only in select patients (initial imaging to exclude hemorrhage and extensive ischemia) for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) evaluation; (2) stepwise-hybrid: NCCT at the time of presentation, with MR angiography ± MR perfusion (MRP) only for MT evaluation; (3) stepwise-advanced: NCCT + CTA at presentation, with MR diffusion-weighted imaging + MRP only for MT evaluation; (4) comprehensive-CT: NCCT + CTA + CT perfusion at the time of presentation; and (5) comprehensive-MR: MR diffusion-weighted imaging + MR angiography + MRP at the time of presentation. Model parameters were defined using evidence-based data. Cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses were performed.

24771,Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A multi-centre prospective cohort study,"AIM: Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ECPR) is an evolving resuscitative method for refractory cardiopulmonary arrests. However, considering the substantial healthcare costs and resources involved, there is an urgent need for a full economic evaluation. We therefore assessed the cost-effectiveness of ECPR for refractory ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VF/pVT). METHODS: We developed a decision model to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients with VF/pVT who received either ECPR or conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) was used as the main outcome measure. This model was a combination of a decision tree model for the acute phase based on a prospective observational study (SAVE-J study), together with a Markov model for long-term follow-up periods extrapolated from published data. To evaluate the robustness of this model, we conducted a comprehensive deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA) and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). RESULTS: ECPR was cost-effective, with an incremental cost of ¥3,521,189 (?30,227), an incremental effectiveness of 1.34 QALY, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥2,619,692 (?22,489) per QALY gained. DSA revealed that the present model was most sensitive to probability of Cerebral Performance Category 1 after ECPR (¥2,153,977/QALY to ¥3,186,475/QALY), patient age (¥2,170,112/QALY to ¥3,334,252/QALY), and long-term medical cost for modified Rankin Scale 0 (¥2,280,352/QALY to ¥2,855,330/QALY). PSA indicated ECPR to be cost-effective and below the willingness-to-pay threshold of ¥5,000,000 with an 86.7 % possibility.

24772,Post-hospital medical respite care for homeless people in Denmark: a randomized controlled trial and cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Being homeless entails higher mortality, morbidity, and prevalence of psychiatric diseases. This leads to more frequent and expensive use of health care services. Medical respite care enables an opportunity to recuperate after a hospitalization and has shown a positive effect on readmissions, but little is known about the cost-effectiveness of medical respite care for homeless people discharged from acute hospitalization. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a 2-week stay in post-hospital medical respite care. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial and cost-utility analysis, from a societal perspective, was conducted between April 2014 and March 2016. Homeless people aged >?18?years with an acute admission were included from 10 different hospitals in the Capital Region of Denmark. The intervention group (n?=?53) was offered a 2-week medical respite care stay at a Red Cross facility and the control group (n?=?43) was discharged without any extra help (usual care), but with the opportunity to seek help in shelters and from street nurses and doctors in the municipalities. The primary outcome was the difference in health care costs 3?months following inclusion in the study. Secondary outcomes were change in health-related quality of life and health care costs 6?months following inclusion in the study. Data were collected through Danish registries, financial management systems in the municipalities and at the Red Cross, and by using the EQ-5D questionnaire. RESULTS: After 3 and 6?months, the intervention group had €4761 (p?=?0.10) and €8515 (p?=?0.04) lower costs than the control group, respectively. Crude costs at 3?months were €8448 and €13,553 for the intervention and control group respectively. The higher costs in the control group were mainly related to acute admissions. Both groups had minor quality-adjusted life year gains. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the cost-effectiveness of a 2-week medical respite care stay for homeless people after hospitalization.

Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy with (177)Lu-Dotatate plus long-acting repeatable [LAR] octreotide 30?mg has been shown to significantly improve progression-free survival and overall survival relative to high-dose octreotide LAR 60?mg in patients with unresectable or metastatic progressive midgut NETs. A long-term cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to assess whether (177)Lu-Dotatate is a cost-effective option versus octreotide 60?mg for patients with unresectable/metastatic progressive midgut NETs from the perspective of French healthcare payer. METHODS: The analysis was performed using a three-state partitioned survival model. In the base case analysis (177)Lu-Dotatate plus octreotide LAR 30?mg was compared with high-dose octreotide LAR 60?mg in patients with midgut NETs. Survival data were obtained from the phase III NETTER-1 trial in patients with metastatic midgut NETs. Future costs and clinical outcomes were discounted at 4% per annum. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, for patients with midgut NETs, (177)Lu-Dotatate treatment improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.21 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to octreotide LAR 60?mg and the lifetime treatment costs were EUR 50,784 higher with (177)Lu-Dotatate resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EUR 42,106 per QALY gained versus octreotide LAR 60?mg. When compared with everolimus, (177)Lu-Dotatate was associated with an ICER of EUR 59,769 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were sensitive to methods used to extrapolate survival data.

24777,Cost-effectiveness of fingolimod versus interferon-ß1a for the treatment of pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis in Canada,"AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fingolimod versus interferon (IFN)-ß1a at a dose of 30?µg per week for the treatment of relapsing pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) in Canada. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A discrete-time Markov model was developed to compare fingolimod with IFN ß-1a over a time horizon of two years representing patients followed up to mean age of 18?years from a Canadian health care system perspective. Twenty-one health states based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were considered: EDSS 0?9 for relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS), EDSS 0?9 for secondary progressive MS, and ""Death."" Relative treatment efficacy for fingolimod versus IFN-ß1a was estimated from the PARADIGMS study. Costs and resource use were obtained from published literature and Canadian sources. Utilities were estimated by mapping the Pediatric Quality of Life inventory data onto the Child Health Utility Index-9 Dimension using a published mapping algorithm. Future costs and benefits were discounted at 1.5% per annum. RESULTS: Compared with IFN ß-1a, fingolimod led to an increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (0.125) with incremental costs (Canadian dollars [CAD] 2,977) and to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CAD 23,886/QALY over a time horizon of two years representing patients followed up to mean age of 18?years. The monetary benefits of fingolimod treatment versus IFN ß-1a at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of CAD 50,000 per QALY gained were higher than the costs. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) both confirmed the robustness of the results. LIMITATIONS: The main limitations of this analysis primarily stem from the limited data availability in POMS.

24778,Model-based evaluation of the cost effectiveness of 3 versus 6 months' adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk stage II colon cancer patients,"BACKGROUND: Our aim was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 3?months'' adjuvant chemotherapy versus 6?months in high-risk (T4 stage?+?microsatellite stable) stage II colon cancer (CC) patients. METHODS: Using the validated PATTERN Markov cohort model, which simulates the disease progression of stage II CC patients from diagnosis to death, we first evaluated a reference strategy in which high-risk patients were treated with chemotherapy for 6?months. In the second strategy, treatment duration was shortened to 3?months. Both strategies were evaluated for CAPOX (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin) and FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin). Based on trial data, we assumed that shortened treatment duration compared with a 6-month regimen was equally effective for CAPOX and less effective for FOLFOX. Adverse events were highest in the 6-month strategy. Analyses were conducted from a societal perspective using a lifelong time horizon. Outcomes were number of CC deaths per 1000 patients and total discounted costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient (pp). Incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB) was calculated using a willingness-to-pay value of €50,000/QALY. RESULTS: For CAPOX, the 6-month strategy resulted in 316 CC deaths per 1000 patients, 6.71 QALYs pp and total costs of €41,257 pp. The 3-month strategy resulted in an equal number of CC deaths, but higher QALYs (6.80 pp) and lower costs (€37,645 pp), leading to a iNMB of €8454 per person for 3?months versus 6?months. For FOLFOX, the 6-month strategy resulted in 316 CC deaths per 1000 patients, 6.71 QALYs pp and total costs of €47,135 pp. The 3-month strategy resulted in more CC deaths (393), lower QALYs (6.19 pp) and lower costs (€44,389 pp). An iNMB of -€23,189 was found for 3?months versus 6?months.

24780,Is an ounce of prevention worth a pound of cure? A cross-sectional study of the impact of English public health grant on mortality and morbidity,"OBJECTIVES: The UK government is proposing to cease cutting the local authority public health grant by reallocating part of the treatment budget to preventative activity. This study examines whether this proposal is evidenced based and, in particular, whether these resources are best reallocated to prevention, or whether this expenditure would generate more health gains if used for treatment. METHODS: Instrumental variable regression methods are applied to English local authority data on mortality, healthcare and public health expenditure to estimate the responsiveness of mortality to variations in healthcare and public health expenditure in 2013/14. Using a well-established method, these mortality results are converted to a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) basis, and this facilitates the estimation of the cost per QALY for both National Health Service (NHS) healthcare and local public health expenditure. RESULTS: Saving lives and improving the quality of life requires resources. Our estimates suggest that each additional QALY costs about £3800 from the local public health budget, and that each additional QALY from the NHS budget costs about £13?500. These estimates can be used to calculate the number of QALYs generated by a budget boost. If we err on the side of caution and use the most conservative estimates that we have, then an additional £1 billion spent on public health will generate 206?398 QALYs (95%?CI 36?591 to 3?76?205 QALYs), and an additional £1 billion spent on healthcare will generate 67?060 QALYs (95%?CI 21?487 to 112?633 QALYs). CONCLUSIONS: Additional public health expenditure is very productive of health and is more productive than additional NHS expenditure.

The present study aimed to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of proactive versus reactive TDM of ADL in pediatric patients with CD from the perspective of the US health-care provider. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate outcomes of proactive versus reactive TDM of ADL in a hypothetical cohort of pediatric CD patients who were in remission on ADL maintenance treatment. Model inputs were derived from published literature and public data. Model outcomes included CD-related direct medical cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of base-case results. RESULTS: When compared with the reactive TDM group, the proactive TDM group saved 0.1960 QALYs at lower cost by USD2021 over a 3-year time frame in base-case analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the ADL drug cost to be the most influential factor.

Immigrants from countries of high incidence to low incidence of gastric cancer retain their elevated risk, but no screening recommendations have been made for these groups in the United States. We aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of different endoscopic screening strategies for noncardia gastric cancer, compared with no screening, among Chinese, Filipino, Southeast Asian, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese Americans. METHODS: We generated a decision-analytic Markov model to simulate a cohort of asymptomatic 50-year-old Asian Americans. The cost effectiveness of 2 distinct strategies for endoscopic gastric cancer screening was compared with no screening for each group, stratified by sex. Outcome measures were reported in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with performing no endoscopic gastric cancer screening, performing a 1-time upper endoscopy with biopsies, with continued endoscopic surveillance if gastric intestinal metaplasia was identified, was cost effective, whereas performing ongoing biennial endoscopies, even for patients with normal findings from endoscopy and histopathology, was not.

RESULTS: Compared with performing no endoscopic gastric cancer screening, performing a 1-time upper endoscopy with biopsies, with continued endoscopic surveillance if gastric intestinal metaplasia was identified, was cost effective, whereas performing ongoing biennial endoscopies, even for patients with normal findings from endoscopy and histopathology, was not. The lowest ICERs were observed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans (all <$73,748/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer with ongoing surveillance of gastric preneoplasia is cost effective for Asian Americans ages 50 years or older in the United States. The lowest ICERs were for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Americans (all <$73,748/QALY).",2020-01-34771,32707341,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,Shailja C Shah,2020,18 / 13,3026-3039,No,32707341,"Shailja C Shah; Andrew Canakis; Richard M Jr Peek; Monica Saumoy; Endoscopy for Gastric Cancer Screening Is Cost Effective for Asian Americans in the United States, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2020 Dec; 18(13):1542-3565; 3026-3039",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,biennial esophagogastroduodenoscopy screening vs. one time esophagogastroduodenoscopy screening,vietnamese american,50 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,-118706.25,United States,2018,-122348.18
24799,Endoscopy for Gastric Cancer Screening Is Cost Effective for Asian Americans in the United States,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer is routine in some countries with high incidence and is associated with reduced gastric cancer-related mortality. Immigrants from countries of high incidence to low incidence of gastric cancer retain their elevated risk, but no screening recommendations have been made for these groups in the United States. We aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of different endoscopic screening strategies for noncardia gastric cancer, compared with no screening, among Chinese, Filipino, Southeast Asian, Vietnamese, Korean, and Japanese Americans. METHODS: We generated a decision-analytic Markov model to simulate a cohort of asymptomatic 50-year-old Asian Americans. The cost effectiveness of 2 distinct strategies for endoscopic gastric cancer screening was compared with no screening for each group, stratified by sex.
