20901,Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program,"PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). METHODS: Using a modified CISNET breast cancer simulation model, we estimated outcomes for women aged 40-64 years associated with three scenarios: breast cancer screening within the NBCCEDP, screening in the absence of the NBCCEDP (no program), and no screening through any program. We report screening outcomes, cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and sensitivity analyses results. RESULTS: Compared with no program and no screening, the NBCCEDP lowers breast cancer mortality and improves QALYs, but raises health care costs. Base-case ICER for the program was $51,754/QALY versus no program and $50,223/QALY versus no screening. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis ICER for the program was $56,615/QALY [95% CI $24,069, $134,230/QALY] versus no program and $51,096/QALY gained [95% CI $26,423, $97,315/QALY] versus no screening. CONCLUSIONS: On average, breast cancer screening in the NBCCEDP was cost-effective compared with no program or no screening.",2019-01-29531,31098856,Cancer Causes Control,Sun Hee Rim,2019,30 / 8,819-826,No,31098856,"Sun Hee Rim; Benjamin T Allaire; Donatus U Ekwueme; Jacqueline W Miller; Sujha Subramanian; Ingrid J Hall; Thomas J Hoerger; Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, Cancer Causes Control, 2019 Aug; 30(8):1573-7225; 819-826",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,"No program, women potentially received screening from another source vs. None",Not Stated,64 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,49443,United States,2018,50959.92
20902,"Long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of blended cognitive behavior therapy for high fear of recurrence in breast, prostate and colorectal Cancer survivors: follow-up of the SWORD randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Blended cognitive behaviour therapy (bCBT) is an effective treatment for fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) in curatively-treated breast, colorectal and prostate cancer survivors with high FCR. However, long-term outcomes are unknown. This study investigated the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of bCBT compared with care as usual (CAU). METHODS: Eighty-eight cancer survivors with high FCR (Cancer Worry Scale >/=14) were randomly assigned to bCBT (n = 45) or CAU (n = 43). Data were collected at baseline and at three, nine and fifteen months from baseline and analysed by modified intention-to-treat. Efficacy was investigated with linear mixed-effects models. Cost-effectiveness was investigated from a societal perspective by comparing costs with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: Participants who received bCBT reported significantly lower FCR compared with CAU (mean difference of - 1.787 [95% CI -3.251 to - 0.323, p = 0.017] at 15 months follow-up), and proportionally greater self-rated and clinically significant improvement at each follow-up measurement. Total QALYs were non-significantly different between conditions when adjusted for utility score baseline differences (0.984 compared to 0.957, p = 0.385), while total costs were euro631 lower (95% CI -1737 to 2794, p = 0.587). Intervention costs of bCBT were euro466. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio amounted to an additional euro2049 per QALY gained, with a 62% probability that bCBT is cost-effective at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of euro20,000 per QALY. Results were confirmed in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: bCBT for cancer survivors with FCR is clinically and statistically more effective than CAU on the long-term. In addition, bCBT is a relatively inexpensive intervention with similar costs and QALYs as CAU.

20905,Cost-Effectiveness of Docetaxel and Paclitaxel for Adjuvant Treatment of Early Breast Cancer: Adaptation of a Model-Based Economic Evaluation From the United Kingdom to South Africa,"OBJECTIVES: Transferability of economic evaluations to low- and middle-income countries through adaptation of models is important; however, several methodological and practical challenges remain. Given its significant costs and the quality-of-life burden to patients, adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer was identified as a priority intervention by the South African National Department of Health. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of docetaxel and paclitaxel-containing chemotherapy regimens (taxanes) compared with standard (non-taxane) treatments. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was undertaken based on a UK 6-health-state Markov model adapted for South Africa using the Mullins checklist. The analysis assumed a 35-year time horizon. The model was populated with clinical effectiveness data (hazard ratios, recurrence rates, and adverse events) using direct comparisons from clinical trials. Resource use patterns and unit costs for estimating cost parameters (drugs, diagnostics, consumables, personnel) were obtained from South Africa. Uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost per patient for the docetaxel regimen compared with standard treatment was R6774. The incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 0.24, generating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R28430 per QALY. The cost of the paclitaxel regimen compared with standard treatment was estimated as -R578 and -R1512, producing an additional 0.03 and 0.025 QALYs, based on 2 trials. Paclitaxel, therefore, appears to be a dominant intervention. The base case results were robust to all sensitivity analyses.

20908,Cost-effectiveness of HCV Treatment Models for People Who Inject Drugs in Opioid Agonist Treatment Programs,"BACKGROUND: Many people who inject drugs in the US have chronic Hepatitis C (HCV). Onsite treatment in opiate agonist treatment (OAT) programs addresses HCV treatment barriers, but few evidence-based models exist. METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment models for OAT patients using data from a randomized trial conducted in Bronx, NY. We used a decision analytic model to compare self-administered individual treatment (SIT), group treatment (GT), directly observed therapy (DOT), and no intervention for a simulated cohort with demographic characteristics of trial participants. We projected long-term outcomes using an established model of HCV disease progression and treatment (HEP-CE).

20911,"Cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of HCV testing, treatment and linkage to care in U.S. prisons","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and treatment uptake in prisons remains low. We aimed to estimate clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness (CE), and budgetary impact (BI) of HCV testing and treatment in United States (U.S.) prisons or linkage to care at release. METHODS: We used individual-based simulation modeling with healthcare and Department of Corrections (DOC) perspectives for CE and BI analyses, respectively. We simulated a U.S. prison cohort at entry using published data and Washington State DOC individual-level data. We considered permutations of testing (risk factor-based, routine at entry or at release, no testing), treatment (if liver fibrosis >/=F3, for all HCV-infected or no treatment) and linkage to care (at release or no linkage). Outcomes included quality adjusted life years (QALY); cases identified, treated and cured; cirrhosis cases avoided; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER); DOC costs (2016 US $); and BI (healthcare cost/prison entrant) to generalize to other states. RESULTS: Compared to ""no testing, no treatment and no linkage to care"", ""test all, treat all, and linkage to care at release"" increased the lifetime sustained virologic response by 23%, reduced cirrhosis cases by 54% at a DOC annual additional cost of $1,440/ prison entrant, and would be cost-effective.

20924,"Cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of HCV testing, treatment and linkage to care in U.S. prisons","BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing and treatment uptake in prisons remains low. We aimed to estimate clinical outcomes, cost-effectiveness (CE), and budgetary impact (BI) of HCV testing and treatment in United States (U.S.) prisons or linkage to care at release. METHODS: We used individual-based simulation modeling with healthcare and Department of Corrections (DOC) perspectives for CE and BI analyses, respectively. We simulated a U.S. prison cohort at entry using published data and Washington State DOC individual-level data. We considered permutations of testing (risk factor-based, routine at entry or at release, no testing), treatment (if liver fibrosis >/=F3, for all HCV-infected or no treatment) and linkage to care (at release or no linkage). Outcomes included quality adjusted life years (QALY); cases identified, treated and cured; cirrhosis cases avoided; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER); DOC costs (2016 US $); and BI (healthcare cost/prison entrant) to generalize to other states. RESULTS: Compared to ""no testing, no treatment and no linkage to care"", ""test all, treat all, and linkage to care at release"" increased the lifetime sustained virologic response by 23%, reduced cirrhosis cases by 54% at a DOC annual additional cost of $1,440/ prison entrant, and would be cost-effective. At current drug prices, targeted testing and liver fibrosis-based treatment provided worse outcomes at higher cost or worse outcomes at higher cost/QALY gained.

20925,A Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Comparing Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation with Antiarrhythmic Drugs in Treatment of Chinese Patients with Atrial Fibrillation,"INTRODUCTION: Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA) is widely used to treat atrial fibrillation (AF) in China. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the long-term cost effectiveness of RFCA versus antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) in treating AF from the perspective of third-party payers. METHODS: The model was structured as a 12-month decision tree leading to a Markov model that simulated the follow-up treatment outcomes and costs with time horizons of 8, 15, and 20 years. Comparators were standard-of-care AADs. Clinical parameters captured normal sinus rhythm, AF, stroke, post-stroke, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), gastrointestinal bleeding, post-ICH, and death. The risk of operative death, procedural complications, and adverse drug toxicity were also considered. The model output was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: RFCA incurred more costs than the AADs but resulted in more QALYs gained than did AADs. The incremental cost per QALY gained with RFCA versus AADs was yen66,764, yen36,280, and yen29,359 at 8, 15, and 20 years, respectively. The sensitivity analyses showed that the results were most sensitive to the changes in RFCA cost and CHADS2 score (clinical prediction rule for assessing the risk of stroke in patients with non-rheumatic AF).

20928,Cost-effectiveness of integrating buprenorphine-naloxone treatment for opioid use disorder into clinical care for persons with HIV/hepatitis C co-infection who inject opioids,"BACKGROUND: Untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) affects the care of HIV/HCV co-infected people who inject opioids. Despite active injection opioid use, there is evidence of increasing engagement in HIV care and adherence to HIV medications among HIV/HCV co-infected persons. However, less than one-half of this population is offered HCV treatment onsite. Treatment for OUD is also rare and largely occurs offsite. Integrating buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) into onsite care for HIV/HCV co-infected persons may improve outcomes, but the clinical impact and costs are unknown. We evaluated the clinical impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of integrating (BUP-NX) into onsite HIV/HCV treatment compared with the status quo of offsite referral for medications for OUD. METHODS: We used a Monte Carlo microsimulation of HCV to compare two strategies for people who inject opioids: 1) standard HIV care with onsite HCV treatment and referral to offsite OUD care (status quo) and 2) standard HIV care with onsite HCV and BUP-NX treatment (integrated care). Both strategies assume that all individuals are already in HIV care. Data from national databases, clinical trials, and cohorts informed model inputs. Outcomes included mortality, HCV reinfection, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs (2017 US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Integrated care reduced HCV reinfections by 7%, cases of cirrhosis by 1%, and liver-related deaths by 3%. Compared to the status quo, this strategy also resulted in an estimated 11/1,000 fewer non-liver attributable deaths at one year and 28/1,000 fewer of these deaths at five years, at a cost-effectiveness ratio of $57,100/QALY. Integrated care remained cost-effective in sensitivity analyses that varied the proportion of the population actively injecting opioids, availability of BUP-NX, and quality of life weights. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating BUP-NX for OUD into treatment for HIV/HCV co-infected adults who inject opioids increases life expectancy and is cost-effective at a $100,000/QALY threshold.",2019-01-29571,31085063,Int J Drug Policy,Joshua A Barocas,2019,/,,No,31085063,"Joshua A Barocas; Jake R Morgan; David A Fiellin; Bruce R Schackman; Golnaz Eftekhari Yazdi; Michael D Stein; Kenneth A Freedberg; Benjamin P Linas; Cost-effectiveness of integrating buprenorphine-naloxone treatment for opioid use disorder into clinical care for persons with HIV/hepatitis C co-infection who inject opioids, Int J Drug Policy, 2019 May 10; ():1873-4758",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical",Integrated treatment with buprenorphine-naloxone (BUP-NX) into onsite care for HIV/HCV infection vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard HIV care with onsite HCV treatment and referral to offsite opioid use disorder (OUD) care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,57100,United States,2017,60289.28
20929,Cost-Effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery Compared With Nonsurgical Treatment in People With Obesity and Comorbidity in Colombia,"BACKGROUND: The increase in obesity prevalence and its relationship with multiple cardiovascular complications have raised the burden of obesity in the general population. Bariatric surgery has shown to be more effective in reducing weight than the traditional pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this alternative compared with standard treatment in the Colombian context. METHODS: A Markov single cohort model was used to simulate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained every year over a base-case 5-year time horizon. The model considers 5 health states: comorbidity, remission, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and death. Four comorbidity conditions were evaluated separately: diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and sleep apnea. The model was evaluated from a third-payer perspective. All costs were expressed in 2016 Colombian pesos ($1.00 = 3051 COP). A 5% annual discount rate was applied to both costs and outcomes. RESULTS: In baseline analysis, bariatric surgery was a cost-effective alternative compared with nonsurgical treatment in the diabetes and hypertension cohort with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6 194 899 and $43 689 527 per QALY gained, respectively. In the sleep apnea cohort, surgery has greater effectiveness and lower costs, which is why it is a dominant strategy. In the dyslipidemia cohort, bariatric surgery is dominated by the nonsurgical approach.

Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of 12 cervical cancer screening strategies. Design, Setting, and Participants: The cross-sectional portion of this study enrolled a convenience sample of 451 English-speaking or Spanish-speaking women aged 21 to 65 years from September 22, 2014, to June 16, 2016, identified at women''s health clinics in San Francisco. In this group, utilities (preferences) were measured for 23 cervical cancer screening-associated health states and were applied to a decision model of type-specific high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-induced cervical carcinogenesis. Test accuracy estimates were abstracted from systematic reviews. The evaluated strategies were cytologic testing every 3 years for women aged 21 to 65 years with either repeat cytologic testing in 1 year or immediate hrHPV triage for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), cytologic testing every 3 years for women age 21 to 29 years followed by cytologic testing plus hrHPV testing (cotesting), or primary hrHPV testing alone for women aged 30 to 65 years. Screening frequency, abnormal test result management, and the age to switch from cytologic testing to hrHPV testing (25 or 30 years) were varied. Analyses were conducted from both the societal and health care sector perspectives. Main Outcomes and Measures: Utilities for 23 cervical cancer screening-associated health states (cross-sectional study) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total costs for each strategy. Results: Utilities were measured in a sociodemographically diverse group of 451 women (mean [SD] age, 38.2 [10.7] years; 258 nonwhite [57.2%]). Cytologic testing every 3 years with repeat cytologic testing for ASC-US yielded the most lifetime QALYs and conferred more QALYs at higher costs ($2166 per QALY) than the lowest-cost strategy (cytologic testing every 3 years with hrHPV triage of ASC-US). All cytologic testing plus hrHPV testing (cotesting) and primary hrHPV testing strategies provided fewer QALYs at higher costs. Adding indirect costs did not change the conclusions. In sensitivity analyses, hrHPV testing every 5 years with genotyping triage beginning at age 30 years was the lowest-cost strategy when hrHPV test sensitivity was markedly higher than cytologic test sensitivity or when hrHPV test cost was equated to the lowest reported cytologic test cost ($14). Conclusions and Relevance: Cytologic testing every 3 years for women aged 21 to 29 years with either continued cytologic testing every 3 years or switching to a low-cost hrHPV test every 5 years confers a reasonable balance of benefits, harms, and costs.

20943,Estimated Quality of Life and Economic Outcomes Associated With 12 Cervical Cancer Screening Strategies: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"Importance: Many cervical cancer screening strategies are now recommended in the United States, but the benefits, harms, and costs of each option are unclear. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of 12 cervical cancer screening strategies. Design, Setting, and Participants: The cross-sectional portion of this study enrolled a convenience sample of 451 English-speaking or Spanish-speaking women aged 21 to 65 years from September 22, 2014, to June 16, 2016, identified at women''s health clinics in San Francisco. In this group, utilities (preferences) were measured for 23 cervical cancer screening-associated health states and were applied to a decision model of type-specific high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV)-induced cervical carcinogenesis. Test accuracy estimates were abstracted from systematic reviews. The evaluated strategies were cytologic testing every 3 years for women aged 21 to 65 years with either repeat cytologic testing in 1 year or immediate hrHPV triage for atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US), cytologic testing every 3 years for women age 21 to 29 years followed by cytologic testing plus hrHPV testing (cotesting), or primary hrHPV testing alone for women aged 30 to 65 years. Screening frequency, abnormal test result management, and the age to switch from cytologic testing to hrHPV testing (25 or 30 years) were varied. Analyses were conducted from both the societal and health care sector perspectives. Main Outcomes and Measures: Utilities for 23 cervical cancer screening-associated health states (cross-sectional study) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and total costs for each strategy. Results: Utilities were measured in a sociodemographically diverse group of 451 women (mean [SD] age, 38.2 [10.7] years; 258 nonwhite [57.2%]). Cytologic testing every 3 years with repeat cytologic testing for ASC-US yielded the most lifetime QALYs and conferred more QALYs at higher costs ($2166 per QALY) than the lowest-cost strategy (cytologic testing every 3 years with hrHPV triage of ASC-US). All cytologic testing plus hrHPV testing (cotesting) and primary hrHPV testing strategies provided fewer QALYs at higher costs. Adding indirect costs did not change the conclusions. In sensitivity analyses, hrHPV testing every 5 years with genotyping triage beginning at age 30 years was the lowest-cost strategy when hrHPV test sensitivity was markedly higher than cytologic test sensitivity or when hrHPV test cost was equated to the lowest reported cytologic test cost ($14). Conclusions and Relevance: Cytologic testing every 3 years for women aged 21 to 29 years with either continued cytologic testing every 3 years or switching to a low-cost hrHPV test every 5 years confers a reasonable balance of benefits, harms, and costs.

20944,Cost-Utility of Early Breast Cancer Surveillance in Survivors of Thoracic Radiation-Treated Adolescent Hodgkin's Lymphoma,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent females treated for Hodgkin''s Lymphoma (HL) are at increased risk of breast cancer (BC). We evaluate the cost-utility of eight high-risk BC surveillance strategies for this population, including the Children''s Oncology Group guideline of same-day annual mammography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) beginning at age 25. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was used to simulate the life histories of a cohort of 500,000 25-year-old females treated for HL at age 15. We estimated BC incidence and mortality, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), healthcare costs, and the relative cost-utility (incremental cost-utility ratio, ICUR) under the eight assessed surveillance strategies. One-way sensitivity analysis enabled model uncertainty evaluation. A publicly-funded healthcare payer perspective was adopted. RESULTS: Costs across the eight screening strategies ranged from $32,643 to $43,739, while QALYs ranged from 24.419-24.480. In an incremental cost effectiveness analysis, annual mammography beginning at age 25 was associated with an ICUR of $43,000/QALY gained, annual MRI beginning at age 25 with a switch to annual mammography at age 50 had an ICUR of $148,000/QALY and annual MRI beginning at age 25 had an ICUR of $227,222/QALY.

20951,Cost-analysis and quality of life after laparoscopic and robotic ventral mesh rectopexy for posterior compartment prolapse: a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess, whether robotic-assistance in ventral mesh rectopexy adds benefit to laparoscopy in terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cost-effectiveness and anatomical and functional outcome. METHODS: A prospective randomized study was conducted on patients who underwent robot-assisted ventral mesh rectopexy (RVMR) or laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy (LVMR) for internal or external rectal prolapse at Oulu University Hospital, Finland, recruited in February-May 2012. The primary outcomes were health care costs from the hospital perspective and HRQoL measured by the 15D-instrument. Secondary outcomes included anatomical outcome assessed by pelvic organ prolapse quantification method and functional outcome by symptom questionnaires at 24 months follow-up. RESULTS: There were 30 females (mean age 62.5 years, SD 11.2), 16 in the RVMR group and 14 in the LVMR group. The surgery-related costs of the RVMR were 1.5 times higher than the cost of the LVMR. At 3 months the changes in HRQoL were ''much better'' (RVMR) and ''slightly better'' (LVMR) but declined in both groups at 2 years (RVMR vs. LVMR, p > 0.05). The cost-effectiveness was poor at 2 years for both techniques, but if the outcomes were assumed to last for 5 years, it improved significantly. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the RVMR compared to LVMR was euro39,982/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at 2 years and improved to euro16,707/QALYs at 5 years. Posterior wall anatomy was restored similarly in both groups. The subjective satisfaction rate was 87% in the RVMR group and 69% in the LVMR group (p = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Although more expensive than LVMR in the short term, RVMR is cost-effective in long-term. The minimally invasive VMR improves pelvic floor function, sexual function and restores posterior compartment anatomy. The effect on HRQoL is minor, with no differences between techniques.",2019-01-29620,31069557,Tech Coloproctol,J Makela-Kaikkonen,2019,23 / 5,461-470,No,31069557,"J Makela-Kaikkonen; T Rautio; A Ohinmaa; S Koivurova; P Ohtonen; H Sintonen; J Makela; Cost-analysis and quality of life after laparoscopic and robotic ventral mesh rectopexy for posterior compartment prolapse: a randomized trial, Tech Coloproctol, 2019 May; 23(5):1128-045X; 461-470",QALY,Finland,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Surgical",Robotic ventral mesh rectopexy vs. Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,"2 Years, 5 years",3.00,3.00,39982,Euro,2017,47705.29
20952,The cost-effectiveness of universal late-pregnancy screening for macrosomia in nulliparous women: a decision-analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the most cost-effective policy for detection and management of fetal macrosomia in late-stage pregnancy. DESIGN: Health economic simulation model. SETTING: All English NHS antenatal services. POPULATION: Nulliparous women in the third trimester treated within the UK NHS. METHODS: A health economic simulation model was used to compare long-term maternal-fetal health and cost outcomes for two detection strategies (universal ultrasound scanning at approximately 36 weeks of gestation versus selective ultrasound scanning), combined with three management strategies (planned caesarean section versus induction of labour versus expectant management) of suspected fetal macrosomia. Probabilities, costs and health outcomes were taken from literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected costs to the NHS and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from each strategy, calculation of net benefit and hence identification of most cost-effective strategy. RESULTS: Compared with selective ultrasound, universal ultrasound increased QALYs by 0.0038 (95% CI 0.0012-0.0076), but also costs by pound123.50 (95% CI 99.6-149.9). Overall, the health gains were too small to justify the cost increase given current UK thresholds cost-effective policy was selective ultrasound coupled with induction of labour where macrosomia was suspected.

METHODS: A health economic simulation model was used to compare long-term maternal-fetal health and cost outcomes for two detection strategies (universal ultrasound scanning at approximately 36 weeks of gestation versus selective ultrasound scanning), combined with three management strategies (planned caesarean section versus induction of labour versus expectant management) of suspected fetal macrosomia. Probabilities, costs and health outcomes were taken from literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected costs to the NHS and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from each strategy, calculation of net benefit and hence identification of most cost-effective strategy. RESULTS: Compared with selective ultrasound, universal ultrasound increased QALYs by 0.0038 (95% CI 0.0012-0.0076), but also costs by pound123.50 (95% CI 99.6-149.9). Overall, the health gains were too small to justify the cost increase given current UK thresholds cost-effective policy was selective ultrasound coupled with induction of labour where macrosomia was suspected. CONCLUSIONS: The most cost-effective policy for detection and management of fetal macrosomia is selective ultrasound scanning coupled with induction of labour for all suspected cases of macrosomia.

20957,Cost-effectiveness analysis of capecitabine plus bevacizumab versus capecitabine alone in elderly patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer from Chinese societal perspective,"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of capecitabine plus bevacizumab compared with capecitabine alone in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) from a Chinese societal perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was conducted to simulate the process of metastatic CRC. Three distinct health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease and death were included. Clinical data were derived from the AVEX trial. Health effectiveness was denoted in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health utilities were derived from previously published studies. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was regarded as the primary endpoint and willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $26,753.37/QALY (3 x per capita GDP of China, 2017). One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were also performed to explore the parameters uncertainty in the study. RESULTS: Over a 10-year life horizon, capecitabine plus bevacizumab gained 1.14 QALYs at an average cost of $21,609.48, while the effectiveness and cost of capecitabine group were 0.99 QALYs and $7274.83, respectively. The ICER between the two groups was $95,564.33/QALY. Parameters that mostly influenced the results of the model were utility of PFS state, duration of PFS state for capecitabine plus bevacizumab, total cost of PFS state for capecitabine plus bevacizumab and price of bevacizumab. The probabilities of capecitabine plus bevacizumab and capecitabine as the dominant option were 0% and 100% at the WTP threshold of $26,753.37/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study showed that capecitabine plus bevacizumab is unlikely to be a cost-effective treatment option for elderly patients with metastatic CRC.",2019-01-29642,31062173,Clin Transl Oncol,P-F Zhang,2019,/,,No,31062173,"P-F Zhang; F Wen; J Zhou; J-X Huang; K-X Zhou; Q-J Wu; X-Y Wang; M-X Zhang; W-T Liao; Q Li; Cost-effectiveness analysis of capecitabine plus bevacizumab versus capecitabine alone in elderly patients with previously untreated metastatic colorectal cancer from Chinese societal perspective, Clin Transl Oncol, 2019 May 6; ():1699-048X",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Capecitabine + bevacizumab vs. Capecitabine,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,95564.33,United States,2018,98496.26
20958,Clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of genotype testing at HIV diagnosis in the United States,"BACKGROUND: US guidelines recommend standard genotype at HIV diagnosis (""baseline genotype"") to detect transmitted drug resistance (TDR) to NNRTIs, NRTIs, and PIs. With INSTI-based regimens now recommended as first-line ART, the clinical and economic value of baseline genotypes is uncertain. METHODS: We used the CEPAC model to examine the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of Baseline Genotype compared to No Baseline Genotype for people starting ART with dolutegravir (DTG) and an NRTI pair. For people with no TDR (83.8%), baseline genotype does not alter regimen selection. Among people with transmitted NRTI resistance (NRTI-R, 5.8%), baseline genotype guides NRTI pair selection and informs subsequent ART after adverse events (DTG AE, 14%). Among people with transmitted NNRTI resistance (NNRTI-R, 7.2%), baseline genotype influences care only for people with DTG AE who move to an NNRTI-based regimen. 48-week virologic suppression varied (40%-92%), depending on TDR. Costs included $320/genotype, $3,000/month for DTG-based and darunavir/ritonavir-based regimens, and $2,500/month for rilpivirine-based regimens. RESULTS: Compared to No Baseline Genotype, Baseline Genotype would result in <1 additional undiscounted quality-adjusted life day (QALD), cost $500 more per person, and would not be cost-effective (ICER, $420,000/quality-adjusted life year). In univariate sensitivity analysis, the clinical benefits of Baseline Genotype never exceeded 5 QALDs for all newly diagnosed people with HIV. Baseline Genotype was cost-effective at current TDR prevalence only under unlikely conditions, such as DTG-based regimens achieving </=50% suppression of transmitted NRTI-R.

20959,Cost-effectiveness of neuromuscular ultrasound in focal neuropathies,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of neuromuscular ultrasound (NMUS) for the evaluation of focal neuropathies. METHODS: A prior prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled trial demonstrated that NMUS, when added to electrodiagnostic testing, resulted in improved clinical outcomes after 6 months of follow-up. From this study, we abstracted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from the 36-item Short Form Health Survey and entered this health-utility estimate into a mixed trial and model-based cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective. Costs of intervention (NMUS) were estimated from Medicare payment rates for Current Procedural Terminology codes. Health care use was otherwise estimated to be equal, but sensitivity analyses further examined this and other key assumptions. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used as the primary outcome with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY. RESULTS: The predicted mean health outcome associated with use of NMUS was 0.079 QALY, and the mean cost was $37, resulting in an ICER of $463 per QALY. Results and conclusions remained robust across all sensitivity analyses, including variations in time horizon, initial distribution of health states, costs, and effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, the addition of NMUS to electrodiagnostic testing when evaluating a focal neuropathy is cost-effective. A study of longer follow-up incorporating total health care use would further quantify the value of NMUS.

Objective: To evaluate critical inputs associated with the cost-effectiveness of EPIT and POIT from a societal perspective. Design, Setting, and Participants: Economic evaluation in which microsimulations with Markov modeling were performed evaluating virtual children aged 4 years over an 80-year time horizon. The base-case costs included a caregiver-reported willingness to pay of $3839 annually for safe and effective food allergy treatment. Estimates of predictive biomarkers or oral challenges were incorporated after the first year of therapy with additional analyses of immunotherapy risk reduction of anaphylaxis and probability of sustained unresponsiveness (SU) to peanut after 4 years. Exposures: Children received EPIT, POIT, or no immunotherapy treatment (n = 10000 per treatment strategy). Main Outcomes and Measures: Rates of therapy-associated adverse reactions and quality-of-life improvements associated with changes in eliciting or tolerated peanut doses were modeled along with quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), anaphylaxis, therapy-associated anaphylaxis, and fatalities. Results: In the base-case analysis without SU to peanut, the EPIT strategy cost less than POIT (mean [SD] cost, $154662 [$46716] vs $163524 [$56800]) and had fewer total episodes of anaphylaxis (mean [SD], 1.33 [1.55] vs 3.83 [5.02] episodes) and fewer episodes of therapy-associated anaphylaxis (mean [SD], 0.62 [1.30] vs 3.10 [4.94] episodes) but had lower QALY accumulation (mean [SD], 26.932 [2.241] vs 26.945 [2.320] QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $216061 for EPIT and $255431 for POIT. Models were sensitive to therapy cost, SU rates, health state utility, and risk reduction of anaphylaxis. With health state utility sensitivity analyses, the ceiling value-based cost (willingness-to-pay threshold $100000/QALY) was between $1568 and $6568 for EPIT and between $1235 and $5235 for POIT. If high rates of SU to peanut can be achieved in longer-term models, EPIT and POIT could produce savings in terms of both cost and QALY.

20962,More cost-effective management of patients with musculoskeletal disorders in primary care after direct triaging to physiotherapists for initial assessment compared to initial general practitioner assessment,"BACKGROUND: A model for triaging patients in primary care to provide immediate contact with the most appropriate profession to treat the condition in question has been developed and implemented in parts of Sweden. Direct triaging of patients with musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) to physiotherapists at primary healthcare centres has been proposed as an alternative to initial assessment by general practitioners (GPs) and has been shown to have many positive effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness from the societal perspective of this new care-pathway through primary care regarding triaging patients with MSD to initial assessment by physiotherapists compared to standard practice with initial GP assessment. METHODS: Nurse-assessed patients with MSD (N = 55) were randomised to initial assessment and treatment with either physiotherapists or GPs and were followed for 1 year regarding health-related quality of life, utilization of healthcare resources and absence from work for MSD. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated based on EQ5D measured at 5 time-points. Costs for healthcare resources and production loss were compiled. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERS) were calculated. Multiple imputation was used to compensate for missing values and bootstrapping to handle uncertainty. A cost-effectiveness plane and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve were construed to describe the results. RESULTS: The group who were allocated to initial assessment by physiotherapists had slightly larger gains in QALYs at lower total costs. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 euro, the likelihood that the intervention was cost-effective from a societal perspective including production loss due to MSD was 85% increasing to 93% at higher thresholds. When only healthcare costs were considered, triaging to physiotherapists was still less costly in relation to health improvements than standard praxis. CONCLUSION: From the societal perspective, this small study indicated that triaging directly to physiotherapists in primary care has a high likelihood of being cost-effective. However, further larger randomised trials will be necessary to corroborate these findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02218749 .

20963,Cost-effectiveness of trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS102) for heavily pretreated metastatic gastric cancer,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Trifluridine/tipiracil (TAS102), a novel oral cytotoxic chemotherapy, significantly improved overall survival compared with placebo in heavily pretreated advanced gastric cancer. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of TAS102 in the third-line or later treatment for this population from the US payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate advanced gastric cancer, including three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD) and death. Model inputs were derived from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial (TAGS trial, NCT02500043). Utilities were extracted from public resources. Costs were calculated from an American payer perspective. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainty. RESULTS: From the US payer perspective, treatment with TAS102 for patients with heavily pretreated advanced gastric cancer was estimated to increase costs by $59,180 compared with the placebo, with a gain of 0.06 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $986,333 per QALY. The costs for progression-free survival of TAS102 group had the greatest impact on the ICERs, as well as the cost of TAS102.

20964,Comparative Cost-utility Analysis Between Aprepitant- and Fosaprepitant-containing Regimens To Prevent Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting in Patients Receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Japan,"PURPOSE: Clinical trials have shown that the addition of aprepitant (APR) or a phosphorylated prodrug of aprepitant, fosaprepitant (FosAPR) as prophylactic antiemetic therapy consisting of a 5-hydrotryptamine-3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone is effective in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. These combination therapies have been commonly used in Japan. In the present study, we performed a cost-utility analysis of APR and FosAPR in the context of the Japanese medical insurance system, and economic efficiency was compared. METHODS: Data from randomized controlled trials that examined the efficacy of APR and FosAPR in the Japanese population were used. A decision tree was constructed to estimate the effectiveness of chemotherapy for 5 days from the day of the treatment and the cost associated with outpatient chemotherapy from the perspective of a payer. Health outcome was expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs were estimated based on medical fees and drug prices from 2018. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated for each regimen containing either APR or FosAPR. The robustness of the model was assessed using 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: The base-case analysis estimated that the addition of APR or FosAPR would have incremental effects of 0.00166 and 0.00143 QALY and incremental costs of 8305 and 11,348 JPY (74 and 101 USD [1 USD = 112.17 JPY]), resulting in ICERs of 4,992,172 and 7,955,560 JPY/QALY (44,505 and 70,924 USD/QALY), respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of a complete response for delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting had the most influence on the ICERs. Reductions in the drug costs of APR and FosAPR also had an effect on the ICERs. According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, APR and FosAPR were dominant in terms of cost-effectiveness in 48.7% and 8.55% of cases, respectively. IMPLICATIONS: The ICER of outpatient prophylactic antiemetic therapy in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy was calculated in the context of the Japanese medical insurance system. Assuming the willingness-to-pay of 5,000,000 JPY/QALY based on the calculated ICER, our findings suggest that although the addition of APR is cost-effective, FosAPR is not cost-effective.",2019-01-29697,31036286,Clin Ther,Munenobu Kashiwa,2019,41 / 5,929-942,Yes,31036286,"Munenobu Kashiwa; Ryo Matsushita; Comparative Cost-utility Analysis Between Aprepitant- and Fosaprepitant-containing Regimens To Prevent Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting in Patients Receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Japan, Clin Ther, 2019 May; 41(5):1879-114X; 929-942",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Aprepitant Regimen vs. Standard/Usual Care- Dexamethasone and Granisetron IV,"Administered >70 mg/m2 of cisplatin as HEC, had a life expectancy of at least 3 months, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score between 0 and 2",Not Stated,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 days,Not Stated,Not Stated,4992172,Japan,2018,46606.42

The robustness of the model was assessed using 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. FINDINGS: The base-case analysis estimated that the addition of APR or FosAPR would have incremental effects of 0.00166 and 0.00143 QALY and incremental costs of 8305 and 11,348 JPY (74 and 101 USD [1 USD = 112.17 JPY]), resulting in ICERs of 4,992,172 and 7,955,560 JPY/QALY (44,505 and 70,924 USD/QALY), respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of a complete response for delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting had the most influence on the ICERs. Reductions in the drug costs of APR and FosAPR also had an effect on the ICERs. According to the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, APR and FosAPR were dominant in terms of cost-effectiveness in 48.7% and 8.55% of cases, respectively. IMPLICATIONS: The ICER of outpatient prophylactic antiemetic therapy in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy was calculated in the context of the Japanese medical insurance system. Assuming the willingness-to-pay of 5,000,000 JPY/QALY based on the calculated ICER, our findings suggest that although the addition of APR is cost-effective, FosAPR is not cost-effective.",2019-01-29697,31036286,Clin Ther,Munenobu Kashiwa,2019,41 / 5,929-942,Yes,31036286,"Munenobu Kashiwa; Ryo Matsushita; Comparative Cost-utility Analysis Between Aprepitant- and Fosaprepitant-containing Regimens To Prevent Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting in Patients Receiving Highly Emetogenic Chemotherapy in Japan, Clin Ther, 2019 May; 41(5):1879-114X; 929-942",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,fosaprepitant regimen vs. Standard/Usual Care- Dexamethasone and Granisetron IV,"Administered >70 mg/m2 of cisplatin as HEC, had a life expectancy of at least 3 months, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score between 0 and 2",Not Stated,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 days,Not Stated,Not Stated,7955560,Japan,2018,74272.32
20966,Proximal Row Carpectomy versus Four-Corner Arthrodesis for the Treatment of Scapholunate Advanced Collapse/Scaphoid Nonunion Advanced Collapse Wrist: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Two mainstay surgical options for salvage in scapholunate advanced collapse and scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse are proximal row carpectomy and four-corner arthrodesis. This study evaluates the cost-utility of proximal row carpectomy versus three methods of four-corner arthrodesis for the treatment of scapholunate advanced collapse/scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse wrist. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed in accordance with the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. A comprehensive literature review was performed to obtain the probability of potential complications. Costs were derived using both societal and health care sector perspectives. A visual analogue scale survey of expert hand surgeons estimated utilities. Overall cost, probabilities, and quality-adjusted life-years were used to complete a decision tree analysis. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Forty studies yielding 1730 scapholunate advanced collapse/scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse wrists were identified. Decision tree analysis determined that both four-corner arthrodesis with screw fixation and proximal row carpectomy were cost-effective options, but four-corner arthrodesis with screw was the optimal treatment strategy. Four-corner arthrodesis with Kirschner-wire fixation and four-corner arthrodesis with plate fixation were dominated (inferior) strategies and therefore not cost-effective. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that when the quality-adjusted life-years for a successful four-corner arthrodesis with screw fixation are lower than 26.36, proximal row carpectomy becomes the optimal strategy. However, multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed the results of our model. CONCLUSIONS: Four-corner arthrodesis with screw fixation and proximal row carpectomy are both cost-effective treatment options for scapholunate advanced collapse/scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse wrist because of their lower complication profile and high efficacy, with four-corner arthrodesis with screw as the most cost-effective treatment.

20970,Comparing ceftolozane/tazobactam versus piperacillin/tazobactam as empiric therapy for complicated urinary tract infection in Taiwan: A cost-utility model focusing on gram-negative bacteria,"BACKGROUND: Complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) is often associated with drug-resistant pathogens and requires therapy with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Choice of empiric therapy should be based on an evaluation of clinical efficacy and medical costs. We used a cost-utility model to compare the empiric use of a new antibiotic, ceftolozane/tazobactam with piperacillin/tazobactam in patients with cUTI. METHODS: The analysis was conducted using a decision tree and patient-level simulation approach. Patients in the model received empiric antibiotic treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam or piperacillin/tazobactam. Outcomes included mortality, medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Parameters related to pathogen distribution, length of hospital stay and medical costs, were estimated based on a cohort of patients with cUTI admitted during July 1st, 2015 to August 31st, 2016 to the National Taiwan University Hospital, a teaching hospital in Taiwan. Isolates used for the patient-level simulation to determine susceptibility to either drug were taken from the Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trend database. RESULTS: The analysis was performed on a simulation of 1000 patients. Empiric use of ceftolozane/tazobactam leads to higher total medical costs (USD 4199.01 per patient versus USD 3594.76, respectively) but also more discounted QALYs (4.80 versus 4.78, respectively). The additional cost per discounted QALY gained associated with empiric ceftolozane/tazobactam was 32,521.08 USD (956,282 NTD).

20971,Trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis of ultrathin Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (UT-DSAEK) versus DSAEK,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ultrathin Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (UT-DSAEK) versus standard DSAEK. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using data from a multicentre randomized clinical trial was performed. The time horizon was 12 months postoperatively. Sixty-four eyes of 64 patients with Fuchs'' endothelial dystrophy were included and randomized to UT-DSAEK (n = 33) or DSAEK (n = 31). Relevant resources from healthcare and societal perspectives were included in the cost analysis. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were determined using the Health Utilities Index Mark 3 questionnaire. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; incremental societal costs per QALY). RESULTS: Societal costs were euro9431 (US$11 586) for UT-DSAEK and euro9110 (US$11 192) for DSAEK. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 0.74 in both groups. The ICER indicated inferiority of UT-DSAEK. The cost-effectiveness probability ranged from 37% to 42%, assuming the maximum acceptable ICER ranged from euro2500-euro80 000 (US$3071-US$98 280) per QALY. Additional analyses were performed omitting one UT-DSAEK patient who required a regraft [ICER euro9057 (US$11 127) per QALY, cost-effectiveness probability: 44-62%] and correcting QALYs for an imbalance in baseline utilities [ICER euro23 827 (US$29 271) per QALY, cost-effectiveness probability: 36-59%]. Furthermore, the ICER was euro2101 (US$2581) per patient with clinical improvement in best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (>/=0.2 logMAR) and euro3274 (US$4022) per patient with clinical improvement in National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 composite score (>/=10 points). CONCLUSION: The base case analysis favoured DSAEK, since costs of UT-DSAEK were higher while QALYs were comparable. However, additional analyses revealed no preference for UT-DSAEK or DSAEK.

20972,Examining the cost-effectiveness of baseline left ventricular function assessment among breast cancer patients undergoing anthracycline-based therapy,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus to guide which breast cancer patients require left ventricular function assessment (LVEF) prior to anthracycline therapy; the cost-effectiveness of screening this patient population has not been previously evaluated. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Yale Nuclear Cardiology Database, including 702 patients with baseline equilibrium radionuclide angiography (ERNA) scan prior to anthracycline and/or trastuzumab therapy. We sought to examine associations between abnormal baseline LVEF and potential cardiac risk factors. Additionally, we designed a Markov model to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ERNA screening for women aged 55 with stage I-III breast cancer from a payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: An abnormal LVEF was observed in 2% (n = 14) of patients. There were no significant associations on multivariate analysis performed on self-reported risk factors. Our analysis showed LVEF screening is cost-effective with ICER of $45,473 per QALY gained. For a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/ QALY, LVEF screening had an 81.9% probability of being cost-effective. Under the same threshold, screening was cost-effective for non-anthracycline cardiotoxicity risk of RR </= 0.58, as compared to anthracycline regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Age, preexisting cardiac risk factors and coronary artery disease did not predict a baseline abnormal LVEF.

20973,Clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of primary cytology versus human papillomavirus testing for cervical cancer screening in England,"OBJECTIVES: In England, human papillomavirus (HPV) testing is to replace cytological screening by 2019-2020. We conducted a model-based economic evaluation to project the long-term clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of routine cytology versus HPV testing. METHODS: An individual-based model of HPV acquisition, natural history, and cervical cancer screening was used to compare cytological screening and HPV testing with cytology triage for women aged 25-64 years (with either 3- or 5-year screening intervals for women aged under 50 years). The model was fitted to data from England''s National Health Service Cervical Screening Programme. Both clinical and economic outcomes were projected to inform cost-effectiveness analyses. RESULTS: HPV testing is likely to decrease annual cytology testing (by 2.76 million), cervical cancer incidence (by 290 cases), and health system costs (by pound13 million). It may increase the number of colposcopies, although this could be reduced without leading to more cancers compared with primary cytology by increasing the interval between screens to 5 years. The impact in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) depends on the quality of life weight given to colposcopies versus cancer. CONCLUSIONS: England''s move from cytology to HPV screening may potentially be life-saving and cost-effective.

20975,Costs and quality of life in a randomized trial comparing minimally invasive and open distal pancreatectomy (LEOPARD trial),"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive distal pancreatectomy decreases time to functional recovery compared with open distal pancreatectomy, but the cost-effectiveness and impact on disease-specific quality of life have yet to be established. METHODS: The LEOPARD trial randomized patients to minimally invasive (robot-assisted or laparoscopic) or open distal pancreatectomy in 14 Dutch centres between April 2015 and March 2017. Use of hospital healthcare resources, complications and disease-specific quality of life were recorded up to 1 year after surgery. Unit costs of hospital healthcare resources were determined, and cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed. Primary outcomes were the costs per day earlier functional recovery and per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: All 104 patients who had a distal pancreatectomy (48 minimally invasive and 56 open) in the trial were included in this study. Patients who underwent a robot-assisted procedure were excluded from the cost analysis. Total medical costs were comparable after laparoscopic and open distal pancreatectomy (mean difference euro-427 (95 per cent bias-corrected and accelerated confidence interval euro-4700 to 3613; P = 0.839). Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was shown to have a probability of at least 0.566 of being more cost-effective than the open approach at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro0 per day of earlier recovery, and a probability of 0.676 per additional quality-adjusted life-year at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro80 000. There were no significant differences in cosmetic satisfaction scores (median 9 (i.q.r. 5.75-10) versus 7 (4-8.75); P = 0.056) and disease-specific quality of life after minimally invasive (laparoscopic and robot-assisted procedures) versus open distal pancreatectomy. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy was at least as cost-effective as open distal pancreatectomy in terms of time to functional recovery and quality-adjusted life-years.

20976,Cost Benefit and Utility Decision Analysis of Turbinoplasty with Adenotonsillectomy for Pediatric Sleep-Disordered Breathing,"OBJECTIVES: Use decision analysis techniques to assess the potential utility gains/losses and costs of adding bilateral inferior turbinoplasty to tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy (T/A) for the treatment of obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) in children. Use sensitivity analysis to explore the key variables in the scenario. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-utility decision analysis model. SETTING: Hypothetical cohort. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Computer software (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, Massachusetts) was used to construct a decision analysis model. The model included the possibility of postoperative complications and persistent oSDB after surgery. Baseline clinical and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) parameters were estimated using published data. Cost data were estimated from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 2018 databases ( www.cms.gov ). Sensitivity analyses were completed to assess for key model parameters. RESULTS: The utility analysis of the baseline model favored the addition of turbinoplasty (0.8890 vs 0.8875 overall utility) assuming turbinate hypertrophy was present. Sensitivity analysis indicated the treatment success increase (%) provided by concurrent turbinoplasty was the key parameter in the model. A treatment success increase of 3% of turbinoplasty was the threshold where concurrent turbinoplasty was favored over T/A alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $27,333/QALY for the baseline model was favorable to the willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 to $100,000/QALY for industrialized nations. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of turbinoplasty for children with turbinate hypertrophy to T/A for the treatment of pediatric oSDB is beneficial from both a utility and cost-benefit analysis standpoint even if the benefits of turbinoplasty are relatively modest.",2019-01-29761,31010383,Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,Grace Baik,2019,/,194599819841882,No,31010383,"Grace Baik; Scott E Brietzke; Cost Benefit and Utility Decision Analysis of Turbinoplasty with Adenotonsillectomy for Pediatric Sleep-Disordered Breathing, Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg, 2019 Jun 18; ():0194-5998; 194599819841882",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Surgical,Tonsillectomy / Adenoidectomy with bilateral inferior turbinoplasty (T/A-BITR) vs. Tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy (T/A),Not Stated,18 Years,0 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,27333,United States,2018,28171.58
20977,Would the Use of Edoxaban Be Cost-effective for the Prevention of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in Spain?,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban vs acenocoumarol in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) in Spain. METHODS: Markov model, adapted to the Spanish setting from the perspective of the National Health System, stimulating the progression of a hypothetical cohort of patients with NVAF throughout their lifetime, with different health states: stroke, haemorrhage, and other cardiovascular complications. Efficacy and safety data were obtained from the available clinical evidence (mainly from the phase III ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 study). The costs of managing NVAF and its complications were obtained from Spanish sources. RESULTS: Edoxaban use led to 0.34 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALY) compared with acenocoumarol. The incremental cost with edoxaban was 3916euro, mainly because of higher pharmacological costs, which were partially offset by lower costs of treatment monitoring and managing NVAF events and complications. The cost per QALY was 11 518euro, within the thresholds commonly considered cost-effective in Spain (25 000-30 000 euro/QALY). The robustness of the results was confirmed by various sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Edoxaban is a cost-effective alternative to acenocoumarol in the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF in Spain.",2019-01-29771,31007166,Rev Esp Cardiol (Engl Ed),Inaki Lekuona,2019,72 / 5,398-406,No,31007166,"Inaki Lekuona; Manuel Anguita; Jose Luis Zamorano; Jose Manuel Rodriguez; Paloma Barja de Soroa; Ferran Perez-Alcantara; Would the Use of Edoxaban Be Cost-effective for the Prevention of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation in Spain?, Rev Esp Cardiol (Engl Ed), 2019 May; 72(5):1885-5857; 398-406",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Edoxaban vs. vitamin K antagonist (acenocoumarol),"diagnosis of NVAF, a moderate to high risk of stroke (CHADS2 stroke risk score)",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,11518,Euro,2017,13742.92
20978,Use of gestational surrogates for women with Eisenmenger syndrome: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Eisenmenger syndrome (ES) is regarded as a contraindication to pregnancy, with therapeutic abortion recommended in the event of unintended pregnancy. However, women with ES continue to desire and attempt pregnancy despite grave risks to their own health. This study compares the costs and outcomes of pregnancy in women with ES to the use of gestational surrogates in their pregnancies. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was built using TreeAge software that compared use of gestational surrogates and pregnancy in women with ES. Maternal death and neonatal outcomes including intrauterine fetal demise, preterm birth, cerebral palsy, and death were assessed. All probabilities and costs were derived from the literature. Utilities were discounted at a rate of 3% across the expected lifespan to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model given changes in baseline assumptions. RESULTS: In a theoretical cohort of 1000 women with ES, pregnancy would result in 360 maternal deaths, 100 stillbirths, 477 preterm births, and 157 neonatal deaths . In these highly desired pregnancies, use of gestational surrogates would prevent 99 and 98% of maternal and neonatal death, respectively. Cases and costs of preterm birth and associated cerebral palsy are also significantly reduced. Use of a gestational surrogate would save $518,255 per woman with a gain of 6.77 QALYs, a dominant strategy. The approach is cost-effective up to a cost of surrogacy of $1.2 million and even if the surrogate achieves pregnancy only 30% of the time. CONCLUSIONS: The use of surrogate mothers for those with ES is cost-effective and results in significantly improved maternal and neonatal outcomes. These benefits are robust in the face of high surrogacy costs largely due to the marked reduction in maternal mortality and preterm birth. These findings should be used to underscore the importance of broadening health care financing for medically-indicated assisted reproduction.",2019-01-29774,31006283,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,Emily K Clennon,2019,/,1-6,No,31006283,"Emily K Clennon; Emmanuelle Pare; Paula Amato; Aaron B Caughey; Use of gestational surrogates for women with Eisenmenger syndrome: a cost-effectiveness analysis, J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med, 2019 May 2; ():1476-4954; 1-6",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Other,Gestational surrogate vs. Eisenmenger syndrome without surrogate,Not Stated,40 Years,20 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-76543.57,United States,2016,-82540.59
20979,Next-Generation Sequencing vs Culture-Based Methods for Diagnosing Periprosthetic Joint Infection After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) after total knee arthroplasty is challenging to diagnose. Compared with culture-based techniques, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is more sensitive for identifying organisms but is also less specific and more expensive. To date, there has been no study comparing the cost-effectiveness of these two methods to diagnose PJI after total knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A Markov, state-transition model projecting lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was constructed to determine the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate parameter assumptions. RESULTS: At our base case values, culture was not determined to be cost-effective compared to NGS, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $422,784 per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses found NGS to be the cost-effective choice above a pretest probability of 45.5% for PJI. In addition, NGS was cost-effective if its sensitivity was greater than 70.0% and its specificity greater than 94.1%. Two-way sensitivity analyses revealed that the pretest probability and test performance parameters (sensitivity and specificity) were the largest factors for identifying whether a particular strategy was cost-effective. CONCLUSION: The results of our model suggest that the cost-effectiveness of NGS to diagnose PJI depends primarily on the pretest probability of PJI and the performance characteristics of the NGS technology. Our results are consistent with the idea that NGS should be reserved for clinical contexts with a high pretest probability of PJI. Further study is required to determine the indications and subgroups for which NGS offers clinical benefit.",2019-01-29776,31005439,J Arthroplasty,Michael T Torchia,2019,34 / 7,1333-1341,No,31005439,"Michael T Torchia; Daniel C Austin; Samuel T Kunkel; Kevin W Dwyer; Wayne E Moschetti; Next-Generation Sequencing vs Culture-Based Methods for Diagnosing Periprosthetic Joint Infection After Total Knee Arthroplasty: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, J Arthroplasty, 2019 Jul; 34(7):0883-5403; 1333-1341",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Medical Device",Next-Generation Sequencing vs. culture-based techniques for diagnosis,After Total Knee Arthroplasty,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,485800,United States,2018,500704.42

We used the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) CKD-CVD policy model to evaluate the effect of statins and ezetimibe on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs in the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK). Net costs below $100,000/QALY (US) or pound20,000/QALY (UK) were considered cost-effective. We investigated statin regimens with or without ezetimibe 10 mg. Treatment effects on cardiovascular risk were estimated per 1-mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol as reported in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists'' Collaboration meta-analysis, and reductions in LDL cholesterol were estimated for each statin/ezetimibe regimen. In the US, atorvastatin 40 mg ($0.103/day as of January 2019) increased life expectancy by 0.23 to 0.31 QALYs in non-dialysis patients with stages 3B to 5 CKD, at a net cost of $20,300 to $78,200/QALY. Adding ezetimibe 10 mg ($0.203/day) increased life expectancy by an additional 0.05 to 0.07 QALYs, at a net cost of $43,600 to $91,500/QALY. The cost-effectiveness findings and policy implications in the UK were similar.

20989,Cost-Effectiveness of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Head and Neck Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has shown promise in identifying subclinical nodal metastasis in patients with high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. However, low metastasis rates may indicate that performing such a procedure in all patients may be unnecessary and costly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model was developed to analyze costs and survival in patients with head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma based on their tumor and nodal metastasis staging and whether or not they received an SLNB. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated based on the change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (US$) between the different options, with a threshold of $100,000 to determine the most cost-effective strategy. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the results. RESULTS: Not performing an SLNB results in 12.26 QALYs and a cost of $3712.98. Performing an SLNB resulted in a 0.59 decrease in QALYs and an increase in cost of $1379.58 for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -2338.27. This trend remained the same across all tumor stages and remained consistent within most sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the most cost-effective strategy is to not perform SLNBs, regardless of the patient''s stage. Low rates of nodal metastasis in addition to low disease-specific death rates were the significant factors in this outcome.

20993,Economic Evaluation of Sarilumab in the Treatment of Adult Patients with Moderately-to-Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Have an Inadequate Response to Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs,"INTRODUCTION: Assess the cost-effectiveness (US healthcare payer perspective) of sarilumab subcutaneous (SC) 200 mg + methotrexate versus conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or targeted DMARD + methotrexate for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults with inadequate response to methotrexate. METHODS: Microsimulation based on patient profiles from MOBILITY (NCT01061736) was conducted via a 6-month decision tree and lifetime Markov model with 6-monthly cycles. Treatment response at 6 months was informed by a network meta-analysis and based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response. Responders: patients with ACR20 response who continued with therapy; non-responders: ACR20 non-responders who transitioned to the subsequent treatment. Utilities and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated via mapping 6-month ACR20/50/70 response to relative change in Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score (short term) and based on published algorithms (long term). Direct costs considered drugs (wholesale acquisition costs), administration and routine care. RESULTS: Lifetime QALYs and costs for treatment sequences on the efficiency frontier were 3.43 and $115,019 for active csDMARD, 5.79 and $430,918 for sarilumab, and 5.94 and $524,832 for etanercept (all others dominated). Sarilumab was cost-effective versus tocilizumab and csDMARD (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $84,079/QALY and $134,286/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested comparable costs and slightly improved health benefits for sarilumab versus tocilizumab, irrespective of threshold. CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe RA, sarilumab 200 mg SC every 2 weeks + methotrexate can be considered a cost-effective treatment option, with lower costs and greater health benefits than alternative treatment sequences (+ methotrexate) beginning with adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab and tofacitinib and below commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds against tocilizumab + methotrexate or csDMARD active treatment.

Direct costs considered drugs (wholesale acquisition costs), administration and routine care. RESULTS: Lifetime QALYs and costs for treatment sequences on the efficiency frontier were 3.43 and $115,019 for active csDMARD, 5.79 and $430,918 for sarilumab, and 5.94 and $524,832 for etanercept (all others dominated). Sarilumab was cost-effective versus tocilizumab and csDMARD (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $84,079/QALY and $134,286/QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested comparable costs and slightly improved health benefits for sarilumab versus tocilizumab, irrespective of threshold. CONCLUSION: In patients with moderate-to-severe RA, sarilumab 200 mg SC every 2 weeks + methotrexate can be considered a cost-effective treatment option, with lower costs and greater health benefits than alternative treatment sequences (+ methotrexate) beginning with adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab and tofacitinib and below commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds against tocilizumab + methotrexate or csDMARD active treatment.

20999,Economic Evaluation of Sarilumab in the Treatment of Adult Patients with Moderately-to-Severely Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Have an Inadequate Response to Conventional Synthetic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs,"INTRODUCTION: Assess the cost-effectiveness (US healthcare payer perspective) of sarilumab subcutaneous (SC) 200 mg + methotrexate versus conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or targeted DMARD + methotrexate for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults with inadequate response to methotrexate. METHODS: Microsimulation based on patient profiles from MOBILITY (NCT01061736) was conducted via a 6-month decision tree and lifetime Markov model with 6-monthly cycles. Treatment response at 6 months was informed by a network meta-analysis and based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response. Responders: patients with ACR20 response who continued with therapy; non-responders: ACR20 non-responders who transitioned to the subsequent treatment.

21000,Safety-Engineered Syringes: An Intervention to Decrease Hepatitis C Burden in Developing Countries-A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis from Egypt,"INTRODUCTION: To assess the cost-effectiveness of introducing the safety-engineered syringe (SES) to decrease hepatitis C burden resultant from unsafe injection practices in healthcare settings. METHODS: A Markov process model for a hypothetical study cohort was developed over a 30-year time horizon to compare the adoption of SES use with the current strategy, conventional syringes (CS), in the Egyptian healthcare settings. The national treatment program was applied in both groups. Health benefits and total direct medical costs were estimated in both strategies. RESULTS: The SES use demonstrated a reduction in the burden of injection-associated HCV infection because of unsafe practices in the Egyptian healthcare settings. The probability of HCV infection was 1.4% in the SES group and 40% in the CS group. Adoption of the SES use averted 177 hepatitis C cases and 157 hepatitis C-related deaths per 10 000 individuals. Introducing SES as a preventive strategy resulted in better quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (difference; 0.95 QALYs) and lower costs (difference; $-1712). CONCLUSIONS: Adoption of SES in the Egyptian healthcare settings is a more effective and cost-saving strategy. Our results are consistent with the WHO Injection Safety Program and Safe Injection Global Network initiatives, which call for adoption of smart syringes. The introduction of SES as one of the most urgently needed interventions is mostly encouraged to decrease hepatitis C burden in similar resource-limited settings. The use of SES as a prevention strategy may bring substantial population-level health gains and governmental cost savings in developing countries.",2019-01-29783,31002984,Value Health Reg Issues,Aya Mostafa,2019,19 /,51-58,No,31002984,"Aya Mostafa; Manal H El-Sayed; Mohamed El Kassas; Manal Elhamamsy; Gihan Hamdy Elsisi; Safety-Engineered Syringes: An Intervention to Decrease Hepatitis C Burden in Developing Countries-A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis from Egypt, Value Health Reg Issues, 2019 May 13; 19():2212-1099; 51-58",QALY,Egypt,Not Stated,Medical Device,safety-engineered syringes vs. Standard/Usual Care- conventional syringes,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,-1802.11,United States,2017,-1902.76
