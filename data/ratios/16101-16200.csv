16101,Cost-Effectiveness of Tomosynthesis in Annual Screening Mammography,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the addition of annual screening tomosynthesis to 2D digital mammography alone for women beginning at 40 years old and to determine differences for age decade subgroups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision-tree analysis comparing annual tomosynthesis versus 2D mammography alone from a federal payer perspective and lifetime horizon was created from published multiinstitutional data, published institutional data, literature values, and Medicare reimbursement rates. Cost-effectiveness was calculated through incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and net monetary benefit calculations. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the implication of different variables including changes in recall rate and disutility for false-positives. RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained for tomosynthesis over 2D alone for all ages (>/= 40 years old) of $20,230, 40- to 49-year-old subgroup of $20,976, 50- to 59-year-old subgroup of $49,725, 60- to 69-year-old subgroup of $44,641, and >/= 70-year-old subgroup of $82,500. Net monetary benefit per decade in the 40- to 49-year-old subgroup was $1,598, 50- to 59-year-old subgroup of $546, 60- to 69-year-old subgroup of $535, and >/= 70-year-old subgroup of $501. Tomosynthesis was the better strategy in 63.2% of the iterations according to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: Addition of annual screening tomosynthesis to 2D mammography beginning at the age of 40 years was cost-effective compared with 2D mammography alone in our analysis.

16106,Cost Effectiveness of Characterised Chondrocyte Implantation for Treatment of Cartilage Defects of the Knee in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: Until recently, treatment options for damage to cartilage in the knee were limited to the use of microfracture or, occasionally, mosaicplasty. The developments of autologous and characterised chondrocyte implantation have provided new treatment options but have large upfront costs. The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of characterised chondrocyte implantation in the UK National Health Service. METHODS: An economic model was constructed in Microsoft Excel(R), with patients undergoing either microfracture or chondrocyte implantation. Following treatment failure, patients can undergo a series of interventions, ultimately ending in knee replacement. Effectiveness and utility were modelled using clinical trial data, which were supplemented with synthesised registry data, and costs were taken from published sources. Results were expressed in clinical events, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and British pounds. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5 % per year. RESULTS: Chondrocyte implantation is estimated to reduce the lifetime probability of knee replacement by 50 % in comparison with microfracture, and to increase QALYs by 0.72 (16.57 vs. 15.85). Costs were estimated to be pound23,307 for chondrocyte implantation, and pound8008 for microfracture, with the incremental cost of pound15,299 for chondrocyte implantation reflecting reduced resource use offsetting some of the procedure cost. These values gave a cost per QALY gained of pound21,245. CONCLUSION: Chondrocyte implantation is estimated to provide substantial patient benefits over a lifetime horizon, with a considerable increase in QALYs. Despite the increase in costs, the procedure is cost effective at standard thresholds used in the UK.",2016-01-21881,27318837,Pharmacoeconomics,Jamie Elvidge,2016,34 / 11,1145-1159,Yes,27318837,"Jamie Elvidge; Ash Bullement; Anthony J Hatswell; Cost Effectiveness of Characterised Chondrocyte Implantation for Treatment of Cartilage Defects of the Knee in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2016 Nov; 34(11):1179-2027; 1145-1159",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Characterised chondrocyte implantation (CCI) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Microfracture (MFx),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,21245,United Kingdom,2014,38286.62

16109,A Cost-Utility Analysis of Prostate Cancer Screening in Australia,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The Goteborg randomised population-based prostate cancer screening trial demonstrated that prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening reduces prostate cancer deaths compared with an age-matched control group. Utilising the prostate cancer detection rates from this study, we investigated the clinical and cost effectiveness of a similar PSA-based screening strategy for an Australian population of men aged 50-69 years. METHODS: A decision model that incorporated Markov processes was developed from a health system perspective. The base-case scenario compared a population-based screening programme with current opportunistic screening practices. Costs, utility values, treatment patterns and background mortality rates were derived from Australian data. All costs were adjusted to reflect July 2015 Australian dollars (A$). An alternative scenario compared systematic with opportunistic screening but with optimisation of active surveillance (AS) uptake in both groups. A discount rate of 5 % for costs and benefits was utilised. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the effect of variable uncertainty on model outcomes. RESULTS: Our model very closely replicated the number of deaths from both prostate cancer and background mortality in the Goteborg study. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for PSA screening was A$147,528. However, for years of life gained (LYGs), PSA-based screening (A$45,890/LYG) appeared more favourable. Our alternative scenario with optimised AS improved cost utility to A$45,881/QALY, with screening becoming cost effective at a 92 % AS uptake rate. Both modelled scenarios were most sensitive to the utility of patients before and after intervention, and the discount rate used. CONCLUSION: PSA-based screening is not cost effective compared with Australia''s assumed willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000/QALY. It appears more cost effective if LYGs are used as the relevant outcome, and is more cost effective than the established Australian breast cancer screening programme on this basis. Optimised utilisation of AS increases the cost effectiveness of prostate cancer screening dramatically.",2016-01-21893,27757918,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Andrew Keller,2017,15 / 1,,Yes,27757918,"Andrew Keller; Christian Gericke; Jennifer A Whitty; John Yaxley; Boon Kua; Geoff Coughlin; Troy Gianduzzo; A Cost-Utility Analysis of Prostate Cancer Screening in Australia, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2017 Feb; 15(1):1179-1896",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prostate cancer screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-based screening vs. Standard/Usual Care- Opportunistic prostate cancer detection,Not Stated,69 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,20 Years,5.00,5.00,147528,Australia,2015,121171.3
16110,What are we paying for? A cost-effectiveness analysis of patented denosumab and generic alendronate for postmenopausal osteoporotic women in Australia,"OBJECTIVE: Zoledronic acid and denosumab were funded by the Australian government for the management of osteoporosis at an equivalent price to alendronate. The price of alendronate has declined by around 65 %, but the price of the other two therapies has remained stable. Using data published since the listing, this paper reports current estimates of the value of denosumab compared to alendronate from an Australian health system perspective. METHODS: A cohort-based state transition model was developed that predicted changes in bone mineral density (BMD), and calibrated fracture probabilities as a function of BMD, age and previous fracture to estimate differences in costs and QALYs gained over a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost per QALY gained for denosumab versus alendronate was $246,749. There is a near zero probability that denosumab is cost-effective at a threshold value of $100,000 per QALY gained. If the price of denosumab was reduced by 50 %, the incremental cost per QALY gained falls to $50,068. DISCUSSION: Current Australian legislation precludes price reviews when comparator therapies come off patent. The presented analysis illustrates a review process, incorporating clinical data collected since the original submission to inform a price at which denosumab would provide value for money.",2016-01-21897,27757069,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Jonathan Karnon,2016,14 /,11,Yes,27757069,"Jonathan Karnon; Ainul Shakirah Shafie; Nneka Orji; Sofoora Kawsar Usman; What are we paying for?

16111,Apixaban was cost-effective vs. acenocoumarol in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with moderate to severe risk of embolism in Chile,"OBJECTIVE: Nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a risk factor for ischemic stroke and systemic embolism. New oral anticoagulants are currently available. The objective of this study was to assess the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) for apixaban vs. acenocoumarol in patients treated in Chile''s public health system. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We assessed cost-utility from the payer perspective with a lifetime Markov model. Epidemiologic characteristics, costs, and utilities were obtained from a Chilean cohort; data were completed with information from international literature. RESULTS: Incremental costs when using apixaban vs. acenocoumarol over a lifetime are CH$2,108,600 with an incremental effectiveness of 0.173 years of life gained (YLG) and 0.182 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The ICUR of apixaban vs. acenocoumarol was CH$12,188,439 per YLG and CH$11,585,714 per QALY. One to 3 times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita threshold is acceptable based on World Health Organization (WHO) norms. Chilean GDP per capita was CH$7,797,021 in 2013. The sensitivity analysis shows that these results are sensitive to the ischemic stroke risk with apixaban, and the intracranial hemorrhage risk due to the use of acenocoumarol.

16112,Cost-Effectiveness and Public Health Effect of Influenza Vaccine Strategies for U.S. Elderly Adults,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of four influenza vaccines available in the United States for persons aged 65 and older: trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3), quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4), a more-expensive high-dose IIV3, and a newly approved adjuvanted IIV3. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model and sensitivity analyses. SETTING: A hypothetical influenza vaccination season modeled according to possible U.S. influenza vaccination policies. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of individuals aged 65 and older in the United States. MEASUREMENTS: Cost-effectiveness and public health benefits of available influenza vaccination strategies in U.S. elderly adults. RESULTS: IIV3 cost $3,690 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, IIV4 cost $20,939 more than IIV3 per QALY gained, and high-dose IIV3 cost $31,214 more per QALY than IIV4. The model projected 83,775 fewer influenza cases and 980 fewer deaths with high-dose IIV3 than with the next most-effective vaccine: IIV4. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, high-dose IIV3 was the favored strategy if willingness to pay is $25,000 or more per QALY gained.

Although 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV-23) are available in China, the costs are borne by the consumer, resulting in low coverage for PCV-7. We aimed to conduct a simulation study to assess the cost-effectiveness and health benefits of PCV-7, 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) and PPV-23 to prevent childhood pneumonia and other vaccine-preventive diseases in China. METHODS: An economic evaluation was performed using a Markov simulation model. Parameters including demographic, epidemiological data, costs and efficacy of vaccines were obtained from previous studies. A hypothetical cohort of 100,000 newborns (focusing on pneumococcal diseases </=7 years old) was followed up until death or 100 years of age. The model incorporated the impact of vaccination on reduction of incidence of pneumococcal diseases and mortality of children </=7 years. Outcomes are presented in terms of disease cases averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, PPV-23 is currently the only cost-effective option, whereas PCV-13 showed the greatest impact on pneumococcal disease burden, reducing invasive pneumococcal diseases by 31.3%, pneumonia by 15.3% and gaining 73.8 QALYs (10,000 individuals at discount rate of 3%). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of PCV-13 and PCV-7 are US$29,460/QALY and US$104,094/QALY, respectively, showing no cost-effectiveness based on the World Health Organization recommended willingness-to-pay threshold. On the other hand, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of PCVs were most sensitive to vaccination costs; if it reduces 4.7% and 32.2% for PCV-7 and PCV-13, respectively, the vaccination will be cost-effective.

16118,Economic Evaluation of Sevelamer versus Calcium-based Binders in Treating Hyperphosphatemia among Patients with End-stage Renal Disease in China,"PURPOSE: To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis study of sevelamer versus calcium-based binders (CBBs) in treating hyperphosphatemia among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in China. METHODS: A decision-analytic model of a lifetime horizon was used for base case analysis from the payers'' perspective. The transition probabilities between different health states were derived from survival analysis. The overall survival of CBBs was derived from the Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited study for up to 44 months and a Weibull regression model was used to extrapolate the overall survival to a lifetime horizon. A hazard ratio (0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.93) of the overall survival for sevelamer versus CBBs was used to calculate the survival of the sevelamer group. Clinical and cost data were derived from literature and health care system in the local setting. Incremental life year and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were the primary outcomes. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the model assumptions and parameters. The results were reported in 2015 Chinese Renminbi. FINDINGS: The incremental cost per life year and per QALY gained of sevelamer versus CBBs was yen44,475 and yen57,910, respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained was below the World Health Organization''s recommended cost-effectiveness threshold ( yen151,070), which is 3 times the gross domestic product per capita of 2015 in China. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to the hazard ratio of overall survival with sevelamer versus CBBs in the 1-way sensitivity analysis. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated that sevelamer had a 89.6% likelihood of cost-effectiveness at the yen151,070 threshold. IMPLICATIONS: Sevelamer is likely to be a cost-effective option in treating hyperphosphatemia among patients with ESRD compared with CBBs in the local context of China.",2016-01-21924,27751671,Clin Ther,Li Yang,2016,38 / 11,2459-2467.e1,Yes,27751671,"Li Yang; Seng Chuen Tan; Can Chen; Xingzhi Wang; Xinya Li; Xiaoyan Yang; Economic Evaluation of Sevelamer versus Calcium-based Binders in Treating Hyperphosphatemia among Patients with End-stage Renal Disease in China, Clin Ther, 2016 Nov; 38(11):1879-114X; 2459-2467.e1",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sevelamer vs. Calcium-based binders,Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESRD),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,57910,Chinese Renminbi,2015,10064.85
16119,Outcome of the Swedish Nationwide Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Program,"BACKGROUND: A general abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening program, targeting 65-year-old men, has gradually been introduced in Sweden since 2006 and reached nationwide coverage in 2015. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of this program. METHODS: Data on the number of invited and examined men, screening-detected AAAs, AAAs operated on, and surgical outcome were retrieved from all 21 Swedish counties for the years 2006 through 2014. AAA-specific mortality data were retrieved from the Swedish Cause of Death Registry. A linear regression analysis was used to estimate the effect on AAA-specific mortality among all men >/=65 years of age for the observed time period. The long-term effects were projected by using a validated Markov model. RESULTS: Of 302 957 men aged 65 years invited, 84% attended. The prevalence of screening-detected AAA was 1.5%. After a mean of 4.5 years, 29% of patients with AAA had been operated on, with a 30-day mortality rate of 0.9% (1.3% after open repair and 0.3% after endovascular repair, P<0.001). The introduction of screening was associated with a significant reduction in AAA-specific mortality (mean, 4.0% per year of screening, P=0.020). The number needed to screen and the number needed to operate on to prevent 1 premature death were 667 and 1.5, respectively. With a total population of 9.5 million, the Swedish national AAA-screening program was predicted to annually prevent 90 premature deaths from AAA and to gain 577 quality-adjusted life-years. The incremental cost-efficiency ratio was estimated to be euro7770 per quality-adjusted life-years. CONCLUSIONS: Screening 65-year-old men for AAA is an effective preventive health measure and is highly cost-effective in a contemporary setting.

16120,Cost-effectiveness of treating wet age-related macular degeneration at the Kuopio University Hospital in Finland based on a two-eye Markov transition model,"PURPOSE: Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness worldwide, which can be treated with regular intraocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. In this study, we wanted to evaluate whether less frequent injections of aflibercept would make it more cost-effective when compared with ranibizumab and low priced bevacizumab. METHODS: We used a two-eye model to simulate the progression and the treatment of the disease. We selected an 8-year period, 3-month cycles and five health states based on the visual acuity of the better-seeing eye. The transition probabilities and utilities attached to the health states were gathered from previous studies. We conducted the analysis from the hospital perspective and we used the health care costs obtained from Kuopio University Hospital. The costs of intraocular adverse events were taken into account. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with 3% discount rate (euro/QALY) for aflibercept compared with monthly bevacizumab was 1 801 228 and when compared with ranibizumab given as needed, the ICER was minus 3 716 943.

CONCLUSION: A two-eye Markov transition model was developed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of wet AMD treatment, as quality of life years (QALYs) are largely based on the visual acuity of the better-seeing eye. Monthly injected bevacizumab was the most cost-effective treatment and monthly ranibizumab the least effective.",2016-01-21931,27481048,Acta Ophthalmol,Pasi Vottonen,2016,94 / 7,652-656,No,27481048,"Pasi Vottonen; Eila Kankaanpaa; Cost-effectiveness of treating wet age-related macular degeneration at the Kuopio University Hospital in Finland based on a two-eye Markov transition model, Acta Ophthalmol , 2016 Nov; 94(7):1755-3768; 652-656",QALY,Finland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ranibizumab monthly vs. Standard/Usual Care- Afllibercept,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,8 Years,3.00,3.00,-13425046,Euro,2015,-16268066.98
16124,Stool DNA Analysis is Cost-Effective for Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in Patients With Ulcerative Colitis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with chronic ulcerative colitis are at increased risk for colorectal neoplasia (CRN). Surveillance by white-light endoscopy (WLE) or chromoendoscopy may reduce risk of CRN, but these strategies are underused. Analysis of DNA from stool samples (sDNA) can detect CRN with high levels of sensitivity, but it is not clear if this approach is cost-effective. We simulated these strategies for CRN detection to determine which approach is most cost-effective. METHODS: We adapted a previously published Markov model to simulate the clinical course of chronic ulcerative colitis, the incidence of cancer or dysplasia, and costs and benefits of care with 4 surveillance strategies: (1) analysis of sDNA and diagnostic chromoendoscopy for patients with positive results, (2) analysis of sDNA with diagnostic WLE for patients with positive results, (3) chromoendoscopy with targeted collection of biopsies, or (4) WLE with random collection of biopsies. Costs were based on 2014 Medicare reimbursement. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (incremental cost/incremental difference in quality-adjusted life-years) compared with no surveillance and a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000. RESULTS: All strategies fell below the willingness-to-pay threshold at 2-year intervals. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $16,362 per quality-adjusted life-year for sDNA analysis with diagnostic chromoendoscopy; $18,643 per quality-adjusted life-year for sDNA analysis with diagnostic WLE; $23,830 per quality-adjusted life-year for chromoendoscopy alone; and $27,907 per quality-adjusted life-year for WLE alone. In sensitivity analyses, sDNA analysis with diagnostic chromoendoscopy was more cost-effective than chromoendoscopy alone, up to a cost of $1135 per sDNA test. sDNA analysis remained cost-effective at all rates of compliance; when combined with diagnostic chromoendoscopy, this approach was preferred over chromoendoscopy alone, when the specificity of the sDNA test for CRN was >65%.

16128,Pharmacoeconomic Analysis of Pain Medications Used to Treat Adult Patients with Chronic Back Pain in the United States,"Chronic back pain is an extremely common health problem. The largest category for pain therapy costs includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioids. However, there has been limited evidence outlining their effectiveness in terms of quality of life for the treatment of chronic back pain. The authors performed a comparative pharmacoeconomic analysis of chronic back pain patients using NSAIDs versus those using opioids alone or combination opioid analgesics. This pharmacoeconomic evaluation was conducted using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS). Adults >/=18 years with chronic back pain diagnosis were included in the study. Individuals using opioids were matched in 1:1 ratio with those using only NSAIDs using propensity scores. All direct medical costs were included, and utility scores from Short Form 6D (SF-6D) were used to calculate QALYs (quality-adjusted life years). Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique was employed to determine the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. After matching, there were 1109 patients in each cohort. The total mean annual cost was found to be $6137.41 for NSAIDs and $8982.28 for opioids. The mean utility gain for NSAIDs was found to be 0.661, whereas for opioids it was 0.633. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at all willingness-to-pay thresholds, the probability of NSAIDs being cost-effective was higher than the probability of the opioids being cost-effective. The authors found NSAIDs to be a dominant strategy as compared with opioids. Considering the higher cost associated with opioids/combination opioid analgesics, it might be cost-effective if they are used in patients who did not respond to the NSAIDs.",2016-01-21936,27749151,J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother,Drishti Shah,2016,30 / 4,300-307,No,27749151,"Drishti Shah; Vamshi Ruthwik Anupindi; Varun Vaidya; Pharmacoeconomic Analysis of Pain Medications Used to Treat Adult Patients with Chronic Back Pain in the United States, J Pain Palliat Care Pharmacother, 2016 Dec; 30(4):1536-0288; 300-307",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) vs. Opioid or Opioid combinations,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-101602.5,United States,2012,-114531.93

A booster dose administered after 10 years might extend protection, but the cost-effectiveness of a booster strategy has not been examined. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the optimal schedule for HZ vaccine DESIGN: We built a Markov model to follow patients over their lifetime. From the societal perspective, we compared costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved of 11 strategies to start and repeat HZ vaccine at different ages. SUBJECTS: Adults aged 60 years. INTERVENTION: HZ vaccine. MAIN MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental costs per QALY saved. KEY RESULTS: At a $100,000/QALY threshold, ""vaccination at 70 plus one booster"" was the most cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $36,648/QALY. ""Vaccination at 60 plus two boosters"" was more effective, but had an ICER of $153,734/QALY.

AIM: The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the therapeutic benefit and net costs (i.e. efficiency frontier) and the quality-adjusted cost of care associated with the evolution of treatment regimens for patients with HCV genotype 1 in the United States. DESIGN: A decision-analytic Markov model. DATA SOURCE: Published literature and clinical trial data. TIME HORIZON: Life Time. PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. INTERVENTION: This study compared four approved regimens in treatment-naive genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C patients, including pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PR), first generation triple therapy (boceprevir + PR and telaprevir + PR), second generation triple therapy (sofosbuvir + PR and simeprevir + PR) and all-oral DAA regimens (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and ombitasvir + paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir +/- ribavirin). OUTCOME MEASURE: Quality-adjusted cost of care (QACC). QACC was defined as the increase in treatment cost minus the increase in the patient''s quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) when valued at $50,000 per QALY. RESULTS: All-oral therapy improved the average sustained virologic response (SVR) rate to 96%, thereby offsetting the high drug acquisition cost of $85,714, which resulted in the highest benefit based on the efficiency frontier. Furthermore, while oral therapies increased HCV drug costs by $48,350, associated QALY gains decreased quality-adjusted cost of care by $14,120 compared to dual therapy. When the value of a QALY was varied from $100,000 to $300,000, the quality adjusted cost of care compared to dual therapy ranged from - $21,234 to - $107,861, - $89,007 to - $293,130, - $176,280 to - $500,599 for first generation triple, second generation triple, and all-oral therapies, respectively. Primary efficacy and safety measurements for drug regimens were sourced from clinical trials data rather than a real-world setting. Factors such as individual demographic characteristics, comorbidities and alcohol consumption of the individual patients treated may alter disease progression but were not captured in this analysis.

16142,Chest Computed Tomographic Image Screening for Cystic Lung Diseases in Patients with Spontaneous Pneumothorax Is Cost Effective,"RATIONALE: Patients without a known history of lung disease presenting with a spontaneous pneumothorax are generally diagnosed as having primary spontaneous pneumothorax. However, occult diffuse cystic lung diseases such as Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) can also first present with a spontaneous pneumothorax, and their early identification by high-resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) chest imaging has implications for subsequent management. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HRCT chest imaging to facilitate early diagnosis of LAM, BHD, and PLCH. METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening HRCT to facilitate early diagnosis of diffuse cystic lung diseases in patients presenting with an apparent primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Baseline data for prevalence of BHD, LAM, and PLCH and rates of recurrent pneumothoraces in each of these diseases were derived from the literature. Costs were extracted from 2014 Medicare data. We compared a strategy of HRCT screening followed by pleurodesis in patients with LAM, BHD, or PLCH versus conventional management with no HRCT screening. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In our base case analysis, screening for the presence of BHD, LAM, or PLCH in patients presenting with a spontaneous pneumothorax was cost effective, with a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,427 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that screening HRCT remained cost effective for diffuse cystic lung diseases prevalence as low as 0.01%. CONCLUSIONS: HRCT image screening for BHD, LAM, and PLCH in patients with apparent primary spontaneous pneumothorax is cost effective. Clinicians should consider performing a screening HRCT in patients presenting with apparent primary spontaneous pneumothorax.",2016-01-21956,27737563,Ann Am Thorac Soc,Nishant Gupta,2017,14 / 1,,No,27737563,"Nishant Gupta; Dale Langenderfer; Francis X McCormack; Daniel P Schauer; Mark H Eckman; Chest Computed Tomographic Image Screening for Cystic Lung Diseases in Patients with Spontaneous Pneumothorax Is Cost Effective, Ann Am Thorac Soc, 2017 Jan; 14(1):2325-6621",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) vs. Standard/Usual Care- No High resolution computed tomography (No HRCT),Patients with Spontaneous Pneumothorax,35 Years,35 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1427,United States,2014,1560.06
16143,"Cost-effectiveness of screening for atrial fibrillation in primary care with a handheld, single-lead electrocardiogram device in the Netherlands","AIMS: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and prevalence increases with age. Patients with AF have a high risk of stroke, and screening for AF is recommended in all people aged 65 years or older to identify patients eligible for stroke prevention. A handheld, single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) device can be used for systematic screening in the population at risk. The objective of this study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening for AF in primary care with the MyDiagnostick(R) during seasonal influenza vaccination in the Netherlands. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lifetime costs and effects of a single screening session for AF detection were assessed from a societal perspective with a decision analytic model consisting of a straightforward decision tree and a joining Markov model. The decision model simulated all patients aged 65 years and over attending the seasonal influenza vaccination in the Netherlands. Event probabilities were derived from clinical trials. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of important model assumptions as well as determining the relative effect of individual parameters. Screening for AF with the MyDiagnostick(R) in all patients older than 65 years that attend seasonal influenza vaccination in the Netherlands would decrease the overall costs by euro764 and increase the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.27 years per patient. Early detection of AF would prevent strokes and leads to beneficial health effects with subsequent cost savings. This screening method would have an estimated probability of 99.8% for being cost-effective at a conservative willingness-to-pay of euro20 000/QALY. CONCLUSION: Screening for AF in primary care with a handheld, single-lead ECG during seasonal influenza vaccination is very likely to be cost saving for identifying new cases of AF in the Dutch population aged 65 years and over.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: People with diabetes have a high risk of developing micro- and macrovascular complications associated with diminished life expectancy and elevated treatment costs. Patient education programs can improve diabetes control in the short term, but their cost-effectiveness is uncertain. Our study aimed to analyze the lifelong cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led telecoaching program compared to usual care in people with type 2 diabetes from the perspective of the Belgian healthcare system. METHODS: The UKPDS Outcomes Model was populated with patient-level data from an 18-month randomized clinical trial in the Belgian primary care sector involving 574 participants; trial data were extrapolated to 40 years; Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), treatment costs and Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) were calculated for the entire cohort and the subgroup with poor glycemic control at baseline (""elevated HbA1c subgroup"") and the associated uncertainty was explored. RESULTS: The cumulative mean QALY (95% CI) gain was 0.21 (0.13; 0.28) overall and 0.56 (0.43; 0.68) in elevated HbA1c subgroup; the respective incremental costs were euro1,147 (188; 2,107) and euro2,565 (654; 4,474) and the respective ICERs euro5,569 (euro677; euro15,679) and euro4,615 (1,207; 9,969) per QALY. In the scenario analysis, repeating the intervention for lifetime had the greatest impact on the cost-effectiveness and resulted in the mean ICERs of euro13,034 in the entire cohort and euro7,858 in the elevated HbA1c subgroup.

16146,Cost-effectiveness of a National Telemedicine Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program in Singapore,"PURPOSE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of a new telemedicine technician-based assessment relative to an existing model of family physician (FP)-based assessment of diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Singapore from the health system and societal perspectives. DESIGN: Model-based, cost-effectiveness analysis of the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program (SiDRP). PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of patients aged 55 years with type 2 diabetes previously not screened for DR. METHODS: The SiDRP is a new telemedicine-based DR screening program using trained technicians to assess retinal photographs. We compared the cost-effectiveness of SiDRP with the existing model in which FPs assess photographs. We developed a hybrid decision tree/Markov model to simulate the costs, effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SiDRP relative to FP-based DR screening over a lifetime horizon. We estimated the costs from the health system and societal perspectives. Effectiveness was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Result robustness was calculated using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ICER. RESULTS: From the societal perspective that takes into account all costs and effects, the telemedicine-based DR screening model had significantly lower costs (total cost savings of S$173 per person) while generating similar QALYs compared with the physician-based model (i.e., 13.1 QALYs). From the health system perspective that includes only direct medical costs, the cost savings are S$144 per person. By extrapolating these data to approximately 170 000 patients with diabetes currently being screened yearly for DR in Singapore''s primary care polyclinics, the present value of future cost savings associated with the telemedicine-based model is estimated to be S$29.4 million over a lifetime horizon. CONCLUSIONS: While generating similar health outcomes, the telemedicine-based DR screening using technicians in the primary care setting saves costs for Singapore compared with the FP model. Our data provide a strong economic rationale to expand the telemedicine-based DR screening program in Singapore and elsewhere.",2016-01-21973,27726962,Ophthalmology,Hai V Nguyen,2016,123 / 12,2571-2580,No,27726962,"Hai V Nguyen; Gavin Siew Wei Tan; Robyn Jennifer Tapp; Shweta Mital; Daniel Shu Wei Ting; Hon Tym Wong; Colin S Tan; Augustinus Laude; E Shyong Tai; Ngiap Chuan Tan; Eric A Finkelstein; Tien Yin Wong; Ecosse L Lamoureux; Cost-effectiveness of a National Telemedicine Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Program in Singapore, Ophthalmology, 2016 Dec; 123(12):0161-6420; 2571-2580",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program (SiDRP) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Family Physician model,Type 2 Diabetes previously not screened for Diabetes Retinopathy,55 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,Singapore,2015,Not Stated

At ages 75 and 80, adding 1 year of exercise to 5 years of oral bisphosphonate therapy is cost-effective at a conventionally accepted threshold compared with bisphosphonates alone. INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of the combined strategy of oral bisphosphonate therapy for 5 years and falls prevention exercise for 1 year compared with either strategy in isolation. METHODS: We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs] (2014 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), using a Markov microsimulation model among hypothetical cohorts of community-dwelling US white women with different starting ages (65, 70, 75, and 80) without prior history of hip, vertebral, or wrist fractures over a lifetime horizon from the societal perspective. RESULTS: At ages 65, 70, 75, and 80, the combined strategy had ICERs of $202,020, $118,460, $46,870, and $17,640 per QALY, respectively, compared with oral bisphosphonate therapy alone. The combined strategy provided better health at lower cost than falls prevention exercise alone at ages 70, 75, and 80. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, results were particularly sensitive to the change in the opportunity cost of participants'' time spent exercising. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probabilities of the combined strategy being cost-effective compared with the next best alternative increased with age, ranging from 35 % at age 65 to 48 % at age 80 at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY.

16159,COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF STRUCTURED EDUCATION IN CHILDREN WITH TYPE-1 DIABETES MELLITUS,"OBJECTIVES: Kids in Control OF Food (KICk-OFF) is a 5-day structured education program for 11- to 16-year-olds with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who are using multiple daily insulin injections. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the KICk-OFF education program compared with the usual care using data from the KICk-OFF trial. METHODS: The short-term within-trial analysis covers the 2-year postintervention period. Data on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), severe hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were collected over a 2-year follow-up period. Sub-group analyses have been defined on the basis of baseline HbA1c being below 7.5 percent (58.5 mmol/mol) (low group), between 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent (80.3 mmol/mol) (medium group), and over 9.5 percent (high group). The long-term cost-effectiveness evaluation has been conducted by using The Sheffield Type 1 Diabetes Policy Model, which is a patient-level simulation model on T1DM. It includes long-term microvascular (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy) and macrovascular (myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, and angina) diabetes-related complications and acute adverse events (severe hypoglycemia and DKA). RESULTS: The most favorable within-trial scenario for the KICk-OFF arm led to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound23,688 (base year 2009) with a cost-effectiveness probability of 41.3 percent. Simulating the long-term complications using the full cohort data, the mean ICER for the base case was pound28,813 (base year 2011) and the probability of the KICk-OFF intervention being cost-effective at pound20,000/QALY threshold was 42.6 percent, with considerable variation due to treatment effect duration. For the high HbA1c sub-group, the KICk-OFF arm was ""dominant"" (meaning it provided better health gains at lower costs than usual care) over the usual care arm in each scenario considered. CONCLUSIONS: For the whole study population, the cost-effectiveness of KICk-OFF depends on the assumption for treatment effect duration. For the high baseline HbA1c sub-group, KICk-OFF arm was estimated to be dominant over the usual care arm regardless of the assumption on the treatment effect duration.",2016-01-21981,27719689,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Hasan Basarir,2016,32 / 4,203-211,No,27719689,"Hasan Basarir; Alan Brennan; Richard Jacques; Daniel Pollard; Katherine Stevens; Jennifer Freeman; Jerry Wales; Katherine Price; COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF STRUCTURED EDUCATION IN CHILDREN WITH TYPE-1 DIABETES MELLITUS, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2016 Jan; 32(4):0266-4623; 203-211",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Kids in Control OF Food (KICk-OFF) vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,Male,Full,"24 Months, Lifetime",3.50,3.50,28580,United Kingdom,2009,49921.73
16160,Cost-Effectiveness of Rotavirus Vaccination in France-Accounting for Indirect Protection,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination against rotavirus has shown great potential for reducing the primary cause of severe childhood gastroenteritis. Previous economic evaluations of rotavirus vaccination in France have not modeled the potential impact of vaccines on disease burden via reduced transmission. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the introduction of pentavalent rotavirus vaccination into the French infant vaccination schedule. METHODS: We developed an age-structured model of rotavirus transmission calibrated to 6 years of French gastroenteritis incidence and vaccine clinical trial data. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of pentavalent rotavirus vaccination considering that 75% of infants would receive the three-dose vaccine course. RESULTS: Our model predicts that rotavirus vaccination will decrease rotavirus gastroenteritis incidence and associated clinical outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, delay the seasonal peak of infection, and increase the age of infection. From the societal perspective, our base-case scenario predicts that vaccination coverage would be cost-effective at euro115 or euro135 per vaccine course at euro28,500 and euro39,500/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively, and suggests that almost 95% of the financial benefits will be recouped within the first 5 years following vaccination implementation. From the third-party payer perspective, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from euro12,500 to euro20,000/QALY, respectively. Our uncertainty analysis suggests that findings were sensitive to various assumptions including the number of hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and the extent of QALY losses per rotavirus episode.

The efficacy of HCV treatment has significantly improved in recent years with the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). However, DAAs are more costly than pegylated-interferon and ribavirin (PegIFN/RBV). We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of four HCV treatment strategies among PWID and treatment scale-up. METHODS: An individual-based model was used describing HIV and HCV transmission and disease progression among PWID. We considered two epidemiological situations. A declining epidemic, based on the situation in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and a stable HCV epidemic, as observed in other settings. Data on HCV incidence, prevalence, treatment setting and uptake were derived from observed data among PWID in Amsterdam. We assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, costs in euro/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) of four treatment strategies: 1) PegIFN/RBV; 2) sofosbuvir/RBV for genotype 2-3 and dual DAA for genotype 1-4; 3) Dual DAA for all genotypes; 4) Dual DAA with 3x treatment uptake. RESULTS: In both types of epidemic, dual DAA therapy was most cost-effective strategy. In the declining epidemic, dual DAA yielded an ICER of 344 euro/QALY while in the stable epidemic dual DAA led to cost-savings. Scaling-up treatment was also highly cost-effective.

16165,Effectiveness of early lens extraction for the treatment of primary angle-closure glaucoma (EAGLE): a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Primary angle-closure glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. In early-stage disease, intraocular pressure is raised without visual loss. Because the crystalline lens has a major mechanistic role, lens extraction might be a useful initial treatment. METHODS: From Jan 8, 2009, to Dec 28, 2011, we enrolled patients from 30 hospital eye services in five countries. Randomisation was done by a web-based application. Patients were assigned to undergo clear-lens extraction or receive standard care with laser peripheral iridotomy and topical medical treatment. Eligible patients were aged 50 years or older, did not have cataracts, and had newly diagnosed primary angle closure with intraocular pressure 30 mm Hg or greater or primary angle-closure glaucoma. The co-primary endpoints were patient-reported health status, intraocular pressure, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year gained 36 months after treatment. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered, number ISRCTN44464607. FINDINGS: Of 419 participants enrolled, 155 had primary angle closure and 263 primary angle-closure glaucoma. 208 were assigned to clear-lens extraction and 211 to standard care, of whom 351 (84%) had complete data on health status and 366 (87%) on intraocular pressure. The mean health status score (0.87 [SD 0.12]), assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions questionnaire, was 0.052 higher (95% CI 0.015-0.088, p=0.005) and mean intraocular pressure (16.6 [SD 3.5] mm Hg) 1.18 mm Hg lower (95% CI -1.99 to -0.38, p=0.004) after clear-lens extraction than after standard care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound14 284 for initial lens extraction versus standard care. Irreversible loss of vision occurred in one participant who underwent clear-lens extraction and three who received standard care. No patients had serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Clear-lens extraction showed greater efficacy and was more cost-effective than laser peripheral iridotomy, and should be considered as an option for first-line treatment.

16166,A short-term cost-utility analysis of insulin degludec versus insulin glargine U100 in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in Denmark,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Insulin degludec is an insulin analog with an ultra-long duration of action that exhibits less intra-patient variability in its glucose-lowering activity, and reduces nocturnal, overall, and severe hypoglycemia relative to insulin glargine. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec relative to insulin glargine in patients with: type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes receiving basal-only therapy (T2DBOT), and type 2 diabetes receiving basal-bolus therapy (T2DBB) in Denmark. METHODS: A short-term (1 year) cost-utility model was developed to model insulin use, non-severe and severe hypoglycemia, and self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients using insulin degludec and insulin glargine from the perspective of a Danish healthcare payer. Where possible, data were derived from Danish patients with diabetes and meta-analyses of clinical trials comparing insulin degludec with insulin glargine. Using these characteristics, the model estimated costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for the two insulin regimens in each of the three diabetes populations. RESULTS: Insulin degludec dominated insulin glargine (i.e. reduced costs while improving quality-adjusted life expectancy) in patients with T1D and patients with type 2 diabetes using a basal-only insulin regimen. In the T2DBB cohort, insulin degludec was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DKK 221,063 per QALY gained, which would be considered cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 30,000 ( approximately DKK 224,000) per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that results were most affected by changes in hypoglycemia rate ratio assumptions, but were broadly insensitive to changes in individual input parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin degludec reduces incidence of hypoglycemia and improves quality-of-life in patients with diabetes.

In the T2DBB cohort, insulin degludec was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DKK 221,063 per QALY gained, which would be considered cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 30,000 ( approximately DKK 224,000) per QALY gained. Sensitivity analysis showed that results were most affected by changes in hypoglycemia rate ratio assumptions, but were broadly insensitive to changes in individual input parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin degludec reduces incidence of hypoglycemia and improves quality-of-life in patients with diabetes.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of insulin degludec relative to insulin glargine in patients with: type 1 diabetes (T1D), type 2 diabetes receiving basal-only therapy (T2DBOT), and type 2 diabetes receiving basal-bolus therapy (T2DBB) in Denmark. METHODS: A short-term (1 year) cost-utility model was developed to model insulin use, non-severe and severe hypoglycemia, and self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients using insulin degludec and insulin glargine from the perspective of a Danish healthcare payer. Where possible, data were derived from Danish patients with diabetes and meta-analyses of clinical trials comparing insulin degludec with insulin glargine. Using these characteristics, the model estimated costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for the two insulin regimens in each of the three diabetes populations. RESULTS: Insulin degludec dominated insulin glargine (i.e. reduced costs while improving quality-adjusted life expectancy) in patients with T1D and patients with type 2 diabetes using a basal-only insulin regimen.

16175,Cost-effectiveness of telehealth for patients with depression: evidence from the Healthlines randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Depression is a prevalent long-term condition that is associated with substantial resource use. Telehealth may offer a cost-effective means of supporting the management of people with depression. AIMS: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a telehealth intervention (''Healthlines'') for patients with depression. METHOD: A prospective patient-level economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial. Patients were recruited through primary care, and the intervention was delivered via a telehealth service. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of depression and PHQ-9 score >/=10 were recruited from 43 English general practices. A series of up to 10 scripted, theory-led, telephone encounters with health information advisers supported participants to effect a behaviour change, use online resources, optimise medication and improve adherence. The intervention was delivered alongside usual care and was designed to support rather than duplicate primary care. Cost-effectiveness from a combined health and social care perspective was measured by net monetary benefit at the end of 12 months of follow-up, calculated from incremental cost and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-consequence analysis included cost of lost productivity, participant out-of-pocket expenditure and the clinical outcome. RESULTS: A total of 609 participants were randomised - 307 to receive the Healthlines intervention plus usual care and 302 to receive usual care alone. Forty-five per cent of participants had missing quality of life data, 41% had missing cost data and 51% of participants had missing data on either cost or utility, or both. Multiple imputation was used for the base-case analysis. The intervention was associated with incremental mean per-patient National Health Service/personal social services cost of pound168 (95% CI pound43 to pound294) and an incremental QALY gain of 0.001 (95% CI -0.023 to 0.026). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound132 630. Net monetary benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20 000 was - pound143 (95% CI - pound164 to - pound122) and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at this threshold value was 0.30. Productivity costs were higher in the intervention arm, but out-of-pocket expenses were lower. CONCLUSIONS: The Healthlines service was acceptable to patients as a means of condition management, and response to treatment after 4 months was higher for participants randomised to the intervention. However, the positive average intervention effect size was modest, and incremental costs were high relative to a small incremental QALY gain at 12 months. The intervention is not likely to be cost-effective in its current form. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: None. COPYRIGHT AND USAGE: (c) The Royal College of Psychiatrists 2016.

16176,Cost-effectiveness analysis of online hemodiafiltration versus high-flux hemodialysis,"BACKGROUND: Clinical studies suggest that hemodiafiltration (HDF) may lead to better clinical outcomes than high-flux hemodialysis (HF-HD), but concerns have been raised about the cost-effectiveness of HDF versus HF-HD. Aim of this study was to investigate whether clinical benefits, in terms of longer survival and better health-related quality of life, are worth the possibly higher costs of HDF compared to HF-HD. METHODS: The analysis comprised a simulation based on the combined results of previous published studies, with the following steps: 1) estimation of the survival function of HF-HD patients from a clinical trial and of HDF patients using the risk reduction estimated in a meta-analysis; 2) simulation of the survival of the same sample of patients as if allocated to HF-HD or HDF using three-state Markov models; and 3) application of state-specific health-related quality of life coefficients and differential costs derived from the literature. Several Monte Carlo simulations were performed, including simulations for patients with different risk profiles, for example, by age (patients aged 40, 50, and 60 years), sex, and diabetic status. Scatter plots of simulations in the cost-effectiveness plane were produced, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were computed. RESULTS: An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro6,982/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was estimated for the baseline cohort of 50-year-old male patients. Given the commonly accepted threshold of euro40,000/QALY, HDF is cost-effective. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that HDF is cost-effective with a probability of ~81% at a threshold of euro40,000/QALY. It is fundamental to measure the outcome also in terms of quality of life. HDF is more cost-effective for younger patients.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors show particular promise due to excellent tolerability profiles, low risk of hypoglycemia, and little effect on body weight. This study evaluated, from the health care system''s perspective, the long-term cost-effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy vs metformin and sulfonylurea (SFU) monotherapy in Thai elderly T2DM patients. METHODS: The clinical efficacy was estimated from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Baseline cohort characteristics and cost parameters were obtained from published studies and hospital databases in Thailand. A validated IMS CORE Diabetes Model version 8.5 was used to project clinical and economic outcomes over a lifetime horizon using a 3% annual discount rate. Costs were expressed in 2014 Thai Baht (THB) (US dollar value). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Base-case assumptions were assessed through several sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For treating elderly T2DM patients, DPP-4 inhibitors were more expensive and less effective, ie, a dominated strategy, than the metformin monotherapy. Compared with SFU, treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors gained 0.031 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a total cost incurred over THB113,701 or US$3,449.67, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of THB3.63 million or US$110,133.50 per QALY.

This study evaluated, from the health care system''s perspective, the long-term cost-effectiveness of DPP-4 inhibitor monotherapy vs metformin and sulfonylurea (SFU) monotherapy in Thai elderly T2DM patients. METHODS: The clinical efficacy was estimated from a systematic review and meta-analysis. Baseline cohort characteristics and cost parameters were obtained from published studies and hospital databases in Thailand. A validated IMS CORE Diabetes Model version 8.5 was used to project clinical and economic outcomes over a lifetime horizon using a 3% annual discount rate. Costs were expressed in 2014 Thai Baht (THB) (US dollar value). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Base-case assumptions were assessed through several sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For treating elderly T2DM patients, DPP-4 inhibitors were more expensive and less effective, ie, a dominated strategy, than the metformin monotherapy. Compared with SFU, treatment with DPP-4 inhibitors gained 0.031 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a total cost incurred over THB113,701 or US$3,449.67, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of THB3.63 million or US$110,133.50 per QALY. At the acceptable Thai ceiling threshold of THB160,000/QALY (US$4,854.37/QALY), DPP-4 inhibitors were not a cost-effective treatment.

16183,Economic evaluation of obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) versus rituximab plus chlorambucil (RClb) in the treatment of adults with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and with comorbidities that make them unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine-based therapy, from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System. METHODS: A Markov model was developed with three mutually exclusive health states: progression-free survival (with or without treatment), progression, and death. Survival time for the two treatments was modeled based on the results of CLL11 clinical trial and external sources. Each health state was associated with a utility value and direct medical costs. The utilities were obtained from a utility elicitation study conducted in the UK. Costs and general background mortality data were obtained from published Spanish sources. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were conducted, with a time frame of 20 years. The health outcomes were measured as life years (LYs) gained and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Efficiency was measured as the cost per LY or per QALY gained of the most effective regimen. RESULTS: In the deterministic base case analysis, each patient treated with GClb resulted in 0.717 LYs gained and 0.673 QALYs gained versus RClb. The cost per LY and per QALY gained with GClb versus RClb was euro23,314 and euro24,838, respectively. The results proved stable in most of the univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, with a probabilistic cost per QALY gained of euro24,734 (95% confidence interval: euro21,860-28,367). CONCLUSION: Using GClb to treat patients with previously untreated CLL for whom full-dose fludarabine-based therapy is unsuitable allows significant gains in terms of LYs and QALYs versus treatment with RClb. Treatment with GClb versus RClb can be regarded as efficient when considered the willingness to pay thresholds commonly used in Spain.",2016-01-22009,27703384,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Luis Felipe Casado,2016,8 /,475-484,No,27703384,"Luis Felipe Casado; Amparo Burgos; Eva Gonzalez-Haba; Javier Loscertales; Tania Krivasi; Javier Orofino; Carlos Rubio-Terres; Dario Rubio-Rodriguez; Economic evaluation of obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil in first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Spain, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2016; 8():1178-6981; 475-484",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Obinutuzumab + chlorambucil vs. Rituximab + chlorambucil,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,24838,Euro,2016,29638.1
16184,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the fixed-dose dual bronchodilator combination tiotropium-olodaterol for patients with COPD in the Netherlands,"PURPOSE: The fixed-dose dual bronchodilator combination (FDC) of tiotropium and olodaterol showed increased effectiveness regarding lung function and health-related quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) compared with the use of its mono-components. Yet, while effectiveness and safety have been shown, the health economic implication of this treatment is still unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-utility and budget impact of tiotropium-olodaterol FDC in patients with moderate to very severe COPD in the Netherlands. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cost-utility study was performed, using an individual-level Markov model. To populate the model, individual patient-level data (age, height, sex, COPD duration, baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second) were obtained from the tiotropium-olodaterol TOnado trial. In the model, forced expiratory volume in 1 second and patient-level data were extrapolated to utility and survival, and treatment with tiotropium-olodaterol FDC was compared with tiotropium. Cost-utility analysis was performed from the Dutch health care payer''s perspective using a 15-year time horizon in the base-case analysis. The standard Dutch discount rates were applied (costs: 4.0%; effects: 1.5%). Both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Budget impact was annually assessed over a 5-year time horizon, taking into account different levels of medication adherence. RESULTS: As a result of cost increases, combined with quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains, results showed that tiotropium-olodaterol FDC had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro7,004/QALY. Without discounting, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro5,981/QALY. Results were robust in univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Budget impact was estimated at euro4.3 million over 5 years assuming 100% medication adherence. Scenarios with 40%, 60%, and 80% adherence resulted in lower 5-year incremental cost increases of euro1.7, euro2.6, and euro3.4 million, respectively.

16190,Clinical and Cost Effectiveness of Apixaban Compared to Aspirin in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: An Australian Perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical and cost effectiveness of apixaban compared to aspirin in the prevention of thromboembolic events for patients with atrial fibrillation for whom vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (warfarin) has been considered unsuitable. METHODS: A previously published Markov model with yearly cycles was updated. Information from the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic acid to prevent Stroke in Atrial Fibrillation (AVERROES) trial in combination with other population data was used to simulate the costs and effects of apixaban compared to aspirin over 10 years. The model comprised five health states. Costs from an Australian healthcare perspective were estimated from published sources for the year 2015. The main outcome of interest was number needed to treat (NNT), number needed to harm (NNH), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) [cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, and cost per year of life saved (YoLS)]. Costs and benefits were discounted at 5.0 % per annum. RESULTS: For each patient followed up over 10 years, NNT to prevent one additional event (thromboembolic event, death) for apixaban compared to aspirin was 4.6 and 11.8, respectively. NNH was 35.9 for non-fatal major bleeding. The model predicted that compared to aspirin, apixaban would lead to 0.33 YoLS (discounted) and 0.29 QALYs gained (discounted), at an incremental cost of AUD$1996 (discounted). This resulted in ICERs of AUD$6011 per YoLS and AUD$6929 per QALY gained. In the sensitivity analyses, ICERs were most sensitive to efficacy measures derived from the AVERROES study, and time frame.

16191,Unsuspected Malignancies in Routine Femoral Head Histopathologic Examination During Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Routine femoral head histopathology during primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) has been recently reported as a potentially useful screening tool for bone- and bone marrow-associated malignancies. However, cost-effectiveness of routine histopathology during THA remains unclear due to low prevalence of significant medical findings which alter patient management. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine histopathology in diagnosing unsuspected malignancy in patients undergoing primary THA. METHODS: From 1993 to 2011, we retrospectively analyzed routine histopathologic findings of 3200 femoral head specimens from 2725 patients that underwent primary THA. Preoperative and postoperative diagnoses were classified into concordant (clinical diagnosis concurred with pathologic diagnosis), discrepant (differing diagnosis with no resultant impact on patient management), and discordant (differing diagnosis with subsequent change in patient management). Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the incremental cost-utility ratio. RESULTS: A total of 3055 of 3200 pathologic samples were concordant with the preoperative diagnosis (95.4%), 140 of 3200 were discrepant (4.4%), and 5 of 3200 were discordant (0.2%). Routine histopathology revealed 1 unsuspected malignancy out of 640 (5 of 3200) femoral heads. The total cost of histopathologic screening was $614,664.80. The average cost to identify a discrepant case was $4390.46, and the cost to identify a discordant case was $122,932.96. The incremental cost-utility ratio was $49,569.74 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates routine femoral head histopathology may be cost-effective in diagnosing unsuspected malignancy at $49,569.74/QALY gained (less than World Health Organization recommended threshold $159,000/QALY gained), providing useful clinical information for surgeons considering the value of routine femoral head histopathology in patients undergoing THA.",2016-01-22022,27697361,J Arthroplasty,Ming Han Lincoln Liow,2017,32 / 3,,No,27697361,"Ming Han Lincoln Liow; Kshitijkumar Agrawal; David W Anderson; Andrew A Freiberg; Harry E Rubash; Young-Min Kwon; Unsuspected Malignancies in Routine Femoral Head Histopathologic Examination During Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, J Arthroplasty, 2017 Mar; 32(3):0883-5403",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine femoral head histopathology during primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,49569.74,United States,2016,53453.42
16192,"Cost effectiveness of adding nucleic acid testing to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus screening of blood donations in Zimbabwe","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of introducing individual-donation nucleic acid testing (ID-NAT), in addition to serologic tests, compared with the exclusive use of serologic tests for the identification of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) I and II among blood donors in Zimbabwe. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The costs, health consequences, and cost effectiveness of adding ID-NAT to serologic tests, compared with serologic testing alone, were estimated from a health care perspective using a decision-analytic model. RESULTS: The introduction of ID-NAT in addition to serologic tests would lower the risk of HBV, HCV, and HIV transmission to 46.9, 0.3, and 2.7 per 100,000 donations, respectively. ID-NAT would prevent an estimated 25, 6, and 9 HBV, HCV, and HIV transfusion-transmitted infections per 100,000 donations, respectively. The introduction of this intervention would result in an estimated 212 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is estimated at US$17,774/QALY, a value far more than three times the gross national income per capita for Zimbabwe. CONCLUSION: Although the introduction of NAT could further improve the safety of the blood supply, current evidence suggests that it cannot be considered cost effective.

16193,Potential Cost-Effectiveness of RSV Vaccination of Infants and Pregnant Women in Turkey: An Illustration Based on Bursa Data,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is considered to be the most important viral cause of respiratory morbidity and mortality among infants and young children. Although no active vaccine is available on the market yet, there are several active vaccine development programs in various stages. To assess whether one of these vaccines might be a future asset for national immunization programs, modeling the costs and benefits of various vaccination strategies is needed. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of RSV vaccination of infants and/or pregnant women in Turkey. METHODS: A multi-cohort static Markov model with cycles of one month was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of vaccinated cohorts versus non-vaccinated cohorts. The 2014 Turkish birth cohort was divided by twelve to construct twelve monthly birth cohorts of equal size (111,459 new-borns). Model input was based on clinical data from a multicenter prospective study from Bursa, Turkey, combined with figures from the (inter)national literature and publicly available data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed in Turkish Lira (TL) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Vaccinating infants at 2 and 4 months of age would prevent 145,802 GP visits, 8,201 hospitalizations and 48 deaths during the first year of life, corresponding to a total gain of 1650 QALYs. The discounted ICER was estimated at 51,969 TL (26,220 US $ in 2013) per QALY gained. Vaccinating both pregnant women and infants would prevent more cases, but was less attractive from a pure economic point of view with a discounted ICER of 61,653 TL (31,106 US $ in 2013) per QALY. Vaccinating only during pregnancy would result in fewer cases prevented than infant vaccination and a less favorable ICER.

16196,Treatment of Massive Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"Massive irreparable rotator cuff tears cause significant shoulder pain and dysfunction. Physical therapy (PT), arthroscopic debridement with biceps tenotomy (AD-BT), and hemiarthroplasty (HA) are treatments shown to reduce pain and improve quality of life. Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) is a newer surgical treatment option that may offer improved function. A cost-effectiveness analysis of these interventions has never been performed, and no head-to-head comparative effectiveness trials currently exist. A Markov decision analytic model was used to compare RTSA, HA, AD-BT, and PT as treatments for elderly patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears. Probabilities for complications, perioperative death, conversion procedures, and reoperations were derived from the literature, and costs were determined by average Medicare reimbursement rates from 2011. Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty yielded the most quality-adjusted life years (QALY) with 7.69, but greater benefits came at higher costs compared with other treatments. Sensitivity analyses showed that PT was the most cost-effective intervention at a health utility of 0.75 or greater (QALY 7.35). The health utility of RTSA was 0.72 or less (QALY 7.48) or RTSA probability of no complications was 0.83 or less (QALY 7.48 at cost of $23,830). Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty yielded benefits at a cost considered good value for money compared with other treatments. Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is the preferred and most cost-effective treatment option for elderly patients with massive irreparable rotator cuff tears.

METHODS: An AB/BA randomized crossover trial design was used. Eighty-two participants completed the study. Participants were current users of optical LVAs who had not tried a p-EVES device before and had a stable visual impairment. The trial intervention was the addition of a p-EVES device to the participant''s existing optical LVA(s) for 2 months, and the control intervention was optical LVA use only, for 2 months. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were conducted from a societal perspective. RESULTS: The mean cost of the p-EVES intervention was pound448. Carer costs were pound30 (4.46 hr) less for the p-EVES intervention compared with the LVA only control. The mean difference in total costs was pound417.

CONCLUSION: Portable electronic vision enhancement system (p-EVES) devices are likely to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources for improving near vision visual function, but this does not translate into cost-effective improvements in quality of life, capability or well-being.",2016-01-22039,27682985,Acta Ophthalmol,Nathan Bray,2016,/,,No,27682985,"Nathan Bray; Andrew Brand; John Taylor; Zoe Hoare; Christine Dickinson; Rhiannon T Edwards; Portable electronic vision enhancement systems in comparison with optical magnifiers for near vision activities: an economic evaluation alongside a randomized crossover trial, Acta Ophthalmol , 2016 Sep 29; ():1755-3768",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Portable Electronic Vision Enhancement System (p-EVES) device vs. Standard/Usual Care- Optical low vision aids (LVAs),Participants were current users of Optical low vision aids (LVAs) who had not tried a Portable Electronic Vision Enhancement System (p-EVES) device before and had a stable visual impairment.,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,56991.43,United Kingdom,2014,102706.96
