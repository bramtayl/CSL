13501,A cost-utility analysis of drug treatments in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Only lamivudine has been included for patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in the National List of Essential Drugs (NLED), a pharmaceutical reimbursement list in Thailand. There have also been no economic evaluation studies of CHB drug treatments conducted in Thailand yet. In order to fill this gap in policy research, the objective of this study was to compare the cost-utility of each drug therapy (Figure 1) with palliative care in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using an economic evaluation model was performed to compare each drug treatment for HBeAg-positive CHB patients. A Markov model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes during a lifetime horizon based on a societal perspective. Direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs were included, and health outcomes were denoted in life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The results were presented as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) in Thai baht (THB) per LY or QALY gained. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were applied to investigate the effects of model parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The ICER values of providing generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir when drug resistance occurred, generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir based on the road map guideline, and tenofovir monotherapy were -14,000 (USD -467), -8,000 (USD -267) , and -5,000 (USD -167) THB per QALY gained, respectively. However, when taking into account all parameter uncertainties in the model, providing generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir when drug resistance occurred (78% and 75%) and tenofovir monotherapy (18% and 24%) would yield higher probabilities of being cost-effective at the societal willingness to pay thresholds of 100,000 (USD 3,333) and 300,000 (USD 10,000) THB per QALY gained in Thailand, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the policy recommendations from this study, the Thai government decided to include tenofovir into the NLED in addition to generic lamivudine which is already on the list. Moreover, the results have shown that the preferred treatment regimen involves using generic lamivudine as the first-line drug with tenofovir added if drug resistance occurs in HBeAg-positive CHB patients.",2014-01-16726,24731689,BMC Health Serv Res,Narisa Tantai,2014,14 /,170,Yes,24731689,"Narisa Tantai; Usa Chaikledkaew; Tawesak Tanwandee; Pitsaphun Werayingyong; Yot Teerawattananon; A cost-utility analysis of drug treatments in patients with HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B in Thailand, BMC Health Serv Res, ; 14():1472-6963; 170",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Generic lamivudine + adefovir based on road map guideline vs. Palliative care,Not Stated,Not Stated,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,121000,Thailand,2010,4536.59

There have also been no economic evaluation studies of CHB drug treatments conducted in Thailand yet. In order to fill this gap in policy research, the objective of this study was to compare the cost-utility of each drug therapy (Figure 1) with palliative care in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis using an economic evaluation model was performed to compare each drug treatment for HBeAg-positive CHB patients. A Markov model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes during a lifetime horizon based on a societal perspective. Direct medical costs, direct non-medical costs, and indirect costs were included, and health outcomes were denoted in life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The results were presented as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) in Thai baht (THB) per LY or QALY gained. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were applied to investigate the effects of model parameter uncertainties. RESULTS: The ICER values of providing generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir when drug resistance occurred, generic lamivudine with the addition of tenofovir based on the road map guideline, and tenofovir monotherapy were -14,000 (USD -467), -8,000 (USD -267) , and -5,000 (USD -167) THB per QALY gained, respectively.

13520,Cost-effectiveness of infliximab versus conventional combination treatment in methotrexate-refractory early rheumatoid arthritis: 2-year results of the register-enriched randomised controlled SWEFOT trial,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of infliximab versus conventional combination treatment over 21 months in patients with methotrexate-refractory early rheumatoid arthritis. METHODS: In this multicentre, two-arm, parallel, randomised, active-controlled, open-label trial, rheumatoid arthritis patients with <1 year symptom duration were recruited from 15 rheumatology clinics in Sweden between October 2002 and December 2005. After 3-4 months of methotrexate monotherapy, patients not achieving low disease activity were randomised to addition of infliximab or sulfasalazine+hydroxychloroquine (conventional treatment group). Costs of drugs, healthcare use, and productivity losses were retrieved from nationwide registers, while EuroQol 5-Dimensions utility was collected quarterly. RESULTS: Of 487 patients initially enrolled, 128 and 130 were randomised to infliximab and conventional treatment, respectively. The infliximab group accumulated higher drug and healthcare costs (euro27,487 vs euro10,364; adjusted mean difference euro16,956 (95% CI 14,647 to 19,162)), while productivity losses did not differ (euro33,804 vs euro29,220; euro3961 (95% CI -3986 to 11,850)), resulting in higher societal cost compared to the conventional group (euro61,291 vs euro39,584; euro20,916 (95% CI 12,800 to 28,660)). Mean accumulated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) did not differ (1.10 vs 1.12; adjusted mean difference favouring infliximab treatment 0.01 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.08)). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the infliximab versus conventional treatment strategy were euro2,404,197/QALY from the societal perspective and euro1,948,919/QALY from the healthcare perspective. CONCLUSIONS: In early, methotrexate-refractory rheumatoid arthritis, a treatment strategy commencing with addition of infliximab, as compared to sulfasalazine+hydroxychloroquine, was not cost-effective over 21 months at willingness to pay levels generally considered acceptable.

13523,Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of stroke prevention through community screening for atrial fibrillation using iPhone ECG in pharmacies. The SEARCH-AF study,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) causes a third of all strokes, but often goes undetected before stroke. Identification of unknown AF in the community and subsequent anti-thrombotic treatment could reduce stroke burden. We investigated community screening for unknown AF using an iPhone electrocardiogram (iECG) in pharmacies, and determined the cost-effectiveness of this strategy.Pharmacists performedpulse palpation and iECG recordings, with cardiologist iECG over-reading. General practitioner review/12-lead ECG was facilitated for suspected new AF. An automated AF algorithm was retrospectively applied to collected iECGs. Cost-effectiveness analysis incorporated costs of iECG screening, and treatment/outcome data from a United Kingdom cohort of 5,555 patients with incidentally detected asymptomatic AF. A total of 1,000 pharmacy customers aged >/=65 years (mean 76 +/- 7 years; 44% male) were screened. Newly identified AF was found in 1.5% (95% CI, 0.8-2.5%); mean age 79 +/- 6 years; all had CHA2DS2-VASc score >/=2. AF prevalence was 6.7% (67/1,000). The automated iECG algorithm showed 98.5% (CI, 92-100%) sensitivity for AF detection and 91.4% (CI, 89-93%) specificity. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of extending iECG screening into the community, based on 55% warfarin prescription adherence, would be $AUD5,988 (euro3,142; $USD4,066) per Quality Adjusted Life Year gained and $AUD30,481 (euro15,993; $USD20,695) for preventing one stroke. Sensitivity analysis indicated cost-effectiveness improved with increased treatment adherence.Screening with iECG in pharmacies with an automated algorithm is both feasible and cost-effective. The high and largely preventable stroke/thromboembolism risk of those with newly identified AF highlights the likely benefits of community AF screening. Guideline recommendation of community iECG AF screening should be considered.",2014-01-16749,24687081,Thromb Haemost,Nicole Lowres,2014,111 / 6,1167-76,No,24687081,"Nicole Lowres; Lis Neubeck; Glenn Salkeld; Ines Krass; Andrew J McLachlan; Julie Redfern; Alexandra A Bennett; Tom Briffa; Adrian Bauman; Carlos Martinez; Christopher Wallenhorst; Jerrett K Lau; David B Brieger; Raymond W Sy; S Ben Freedman; Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of stroke prevention through community screening for atrial fibrillation using iPhone ECG in pharmacies.

13524,Surgical treatment for adult spinal deformity: projected cost effectiveness at 5-year follow-up,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, expenditures related to spine care are estimated to account for $86 billion annually. Policy makers have set a cost-effectiveness benchmark of less than $100,000/quality adjusted life year (QALY), forcing surgeons to defend their choices economically. This study projects the cost/QALY for surgical treatment of adult spinal deformity at 5-year follow-up based on 2-year cost- and health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) data. METHODS: In a review of 541 patients with adult spinal deformity, the patients who underwent revision or were likely to undergo revision were identified and cost of surgery was doubled to account for the second procedure; all other patients maintained the cost of the initial surgery. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was modeled by revision status based on literature findings. Total surgical cost was based on Medicare reimbursement. Chi square and student t tests were utilized to compare cost-effective and non-cost-effective patients. RESULTS: The average cost/QALY at 5-year follow-up was $120,311.73. A total of 40.7% of patients fell under the threshold of a cost/QALY <$100,000. Cost-effective patients had higher baseline ODI scores (45% vs 34% [P=0.001]), lower baseline total Scoliosis Research Society scores (2.89 vs 3.00 [P=0.04]), and shorter fusions (8.23 vs 9.87 [P=0.0001]). CONCLUSION: We found 40.7% of patients to be below the threshold of cost effectiveness. Factors associated with reaching the threshold <$100,000/QALY were greater preoperative disability, diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis, poor preoperative HRQOL scores, and fewer fusion levels.",2014-01-16752,24688328,Ochsner J,Jamie Terran,2014,14 / 1,14-22,No,24688328,"Jamie Terran; Brian J McHugh; Charla R Fischer; Baron Lonner; Daniel Warren; Steven Glassman; Keith Bridwell; Frank Schwab; Virginie Lafage; Surgical treatment for adult spinal deformity: projected cost effectiveness at 5-year follow-up, Ochsner J, ; 14(1):1524-5012; 14-22",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surgical treatment vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,120311,United States,2012,135621.18
13525,Cost effectiveness of a 92-gene assay for the diagnosis of metastatic cancer,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the clinical and economic trade-offs involved in using a molecular assay (92-gene assay, CancerTYPE ID) to aid in identifying the primary site of difficult-to-diagnose metastatic cancers and to explore whether the 92-gene assay can be used to standardize the diagnostic process and costs for clinicians, patients, and payers. METHODS: Four decision-analytic models were developed to project the lifetime clinical and economic impact of incorporating the 92-gene assay compared with standard care alone. For each model, total and incremental costs, life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and the proportion of patients treated correctly versus incorrectly were projected from the payer perspective. Model inputs were based on published literature, analyses of SEER (Surveillance Epidemiology and End RESULTS) data, publicly available data, and interviews with clinical experts. RESULTS: In all four models, the 92-gene assay increased the proportion of patients treated correctly, decreased the proportion of patients treated with empiric therapy, and increased quality-adjusted survival. In the primary model, the ICER was $50,273/QALY; thus, the 92-gene assay is therefore cost effective when considering a societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. These findings were robust across sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the 92-gene assay for diagnosing metastatic tumors of uncertain origin is associated with reduced misdiagnoses, increased survival, and improved quality of life. Incorporating the assay into current practice is a cost-effective approach to standardizing diagnostic methods while improving patient care. Limitations of this analysis are the lack of data availability and resulting modeling simplifications, although sensitivity analyses showed these to not be key drivers of results.",2014-01-16754,24689556,J Med Econ,Tanya G K Bentley,2014,17 / 8,527-37,Yes,24689556,"Tanya G K Bentley; Brock E Schroeder; Catherine A Schnabel; Mark G Erlander; Wendy C Hsiao; Jesse D Ortendahl; Michael S Broder; Cost effectiveness of a 92-gene assay for the diagnosis of metastatic cancer, J Med Econ, ; 17(8):1369-6998; 527-37",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,92-gene assay to identify the primary tumor site vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,50273,United States,2012,56670.49
13526,Modeling the benefits and costs of integrating an acceptable HLA mismatch allocation model for highly sensitized patients,"BACKGROUND: The Eurotransplant acceptable mismatch program has improved transplantation access for highly sensitized recipients. However, the benefits and costs of implementing such a program remain unknown. METHODS: Using decision analytical modeling, we compared the average waiting time for transplantation, overall survival gains (in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years gained), and costs of integrating an acceptable mismatch allocation model compared with the current deceased-donor kidney allocation model in Australia. RESULTS: Acceptable mismatches were identified in 12 of 28 (43%) highly sensitized recipients using HLAMatchmaker. Inclusion of acceptable mismatches in the current allocation model improved the transplantation access for four (14%) highly sensitized recipients, with an average reduction in waiting time of 34 months (from 86 to 52 months). Compared with the current allocation model, incorporating an acceptable mismatch allocation model achieved an overall lifetime gain of 0.034 quality-adjusted life-years and savings of over $4,000 per highly sensitized patient, with a small consequential loss of 0.005 quality-adjusted life-years and extra costs of $800 for every reallocated patient. CONCLUSIONS: Despite modest overall health gains, application of an acceptable mismatch allocation model is an equitable approach to improve transplantation access for highly sensitized transplant candidates without compromising the overall health benefits among the other patients on the deceased-donor waitlist in Australia.",2014-01-16759,24690676,Transplantation,Hung Do Nguyen,2014,97 / 7,769-74,No,24690676,"Hung Do Nguyen; Germaine Wong; Kirsten Howard; Frans H J Claas; Jonathan C Craig; Samantha Fidler; Lloyd D'Orsogna; Jeremey R Chapman; Ashley Irish; Paolo Ferrari; Frank T Christiansen; Wai H Lim; Modeling the benefits and costs of integrating an acceptable HLA mismatch allocation model for highly sensitized patients, Transplantation, ; 97(7):0041-1337; 769-74",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eurotransplant acceptable HLA mismatch allocation program for transplant vs. Standard/Usual Care- current allocation model,highly sensitized recipients,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-128088.23,Australia,2011,-152275.37

INTRODUCTION: Vitamin D supplementation has a demonstrated ability to reduce the incidence of hip fractures. The efficiency of lifetime supplementation has not yet been assessed in the population over 65 years without previous hip fracture. The objective was to analyze the efficiency of various vitamin D supplementation strategies for that population. METHODS: A Markov micro-simulation model was built with data extracted from published studies and from the French reimbursement schedule. Four vitamin D supplementation strategies were evaluated on our study population: (1) no treatment, (2) supplementation without any serum level check; (3) supplementation with a serum level check 3 months after initiation and subsequent treatment adaptation; (4) population screening for vitamin D insufficiency followed by treatment based on the vitamin D serum level. RESULTS: ""Treat, then check"" and ""screen and treat"" were two cost-effective strategies and dominated ""treat without check"" with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of euro5,219/quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and euro9,104/QALY, respectively. The acceptability curves showed that over euro6,000/QALY, the ""screen and treat"" strategy had the greatest probability of being cost-effective, and the ""no treatment"" strategy would never be cost-effective if society were willing to spend over euro8,000/QALY. The sensitivity analysis showed that among all parameters varying within realistic ranges, the cost of vitamin D treatment had the greatest effect and yet remained below the WHO cost-effectiveness thresholds.

The available published literature provided the data source. The target population was made up of untreated Caucasian patients, aged 50 years, with G1CHC and these were evaluated over a lifetime horizon by Markov model. The study was carried out from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. Outcomes included discounted costs (in euros at 2013 value), life-years gained (LYG), quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Cost of SOF was assumed to be euro 3,500 per week, i.e., the price generating a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro 25,000 per LYG compared with TVR in the entire population of untreated G1 patients. The robustness of the results was evaluated by one-way deterministic and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses. SOF was cost-effective compared with BOC in all strategies with the exception of cirrhosis and IL28B CC patients.

In comparison with TVR-based strategies, SOF was cost-effective in IL28B CT/TT (ICER per LYG euro 22,229) and G1a (euro 19,359) patients, not cost-effective in IL28B CC (euro45,330), fibrosis F0-F3 (euro 26,444), and in cirrhosis (euro 34,906) patients, and dominated in G1b patients. The models were sensitive to SOF prices and to likelihood of sustained virological response. CONCLUSION: In untreated G1 CHC patients, SOF-based TT may be a cost-effective alternative to first-generation protease inhibitors depending on pricing. The cost-effectiveness of SOF improved in IL28B CT/TT and G1a patients. SOF was dominated by TVR in G1b patients even if, in clinical practice, this issue could be counterbalanced by the good tolerability profile of SOF and by the shorter treatment duration.",2014-01-16762,24691835,Hepatology,Salvatore Petta,2014,59 / 5,1692-705,No,24691835,"Salvatore Petta; Giuseppe Cabibbo; Marco Enea; Fabio Salvatore Macaluso; Antonella Plaia; Raffaele Bruno; Antonio Gasbarrini; Antonio Craxi; Calogero Camma; WEF Study Group; Cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based triple therapy for untreated patients with genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C, Hepatology, ; 59(5):0270-9139; 1692-705",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sofosbuvir-G1a therapy vs. Boceprevir-response-guided-G1a therapy,"Untreated, genotype 1b",Not Stated,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,17757.5,Euro,2014,25813.35
13542,Cost-effectiveness of competing strategies for management of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a decision analysis,"BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is an important cause of morbidity and healthcare costs, and is characterized by high rates of disease recurrence. The cost-effectiveness of newer treatments for recurrent CDI has not been examined, yet would be important to inform clinical practice. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost effectiveness of competing strategies for recurrent CDI. METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic model comparing 4 treatment strategies for first-line treatment of recurrent CDI in a population with a median age of 65 years: metronidazole, vancomycin, fidaxomicin, and fecal microbiota transplant (FMT). We modeled up to 2 additional recurrences following the initial recurrence. We assumed FMT delivery via colonoscopy as our base case, but conducted sensitivity analyses based on different modes of delivery. Willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: At our base case estimates, initial treatment of recurrent CDI using FMT colonoscopy was the most cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $17 016 relative to oral vancomycin. Fidaxomicin and metronidazole were both dominated by FMT colonoscopy. On sensitivity analysis, FMT colonoscopy remained the most cost-effective strategy at cure rates >88.4% and CDI recurrence rates <14.9%. Fidaxomicin required a cost <$1359 to meet our cost-effectiveness threshold.

13548,Cost-effectiveness of the convergent procedure and catheter ablation for non-paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,"OBJECTIVE: Patients with persistent or longstanding atrial fibrillation have modest success achieving sinus rhythm with catheter ablation or rhythm control medications. Their high risk of stroke, bleed, and heart failure leads to significant morbidity and health care costs. The convergent procedure has been shown to be successful in this population, with 80% of patients in sinus rhythm after 1 year. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the convergent procedure, catheter ablation, and medical management for non-paroxysmal AF patients. METHODS: A Markov micro-simulation model was used to estimate costs and effectiveness from a payer perspective. Parameter estimates were from the literature. Three patient cohorts were simulated, representing lower, medium, and higher risks of stroke, bleed, heart failure, and hospitalization. Effects were estimated by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Single-variable sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: After 5 years, convergent procedure patients averaged 1.10 procedures, with 75% of survivors in sinus rhythm; catheter ablation patients had 1.65 procedures, with 49% in sinus rhythm. Compared to medical management, catheter ablation and the convergent procedure were cost-effective for the lower risk (ICER <$35,000) and medium risk (ICER <$15,000) cohorts. The procedures dominated medical management for the higher risk cohort (lower cost and higher QALYs). The convergent procedure dominated catheter ablation for all risk cohorts. RESULTS were subject to simplifying assumptions and limited by uncertain factors such as long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm after successful procedure and incremental AF-associated event rates for AF patients relative to patients in sinus rhythm. In the absence of clinical trial data, convergent procedure efficacy was estimated with observational evidence. Limitations were addressed with sensitivity analyses and a moderate 5 year time horizon.

13551,Cost-effectiveness analysis of transnasal fentanyl citrate for the treatment of breakthrough cancer pain,"INTRODUCTION: Pain is a symptom of cancer and is categorized in two forms: background pain to be treated with analgesics, and breakthrough cancer pain (BTcP), which needs drug treatment on demand. We present a cost-effectiveness analysis of transnasal fentanyl citrate as an alternative to morphine. METHODS: A Markov model considers a cohort of 100 patients on a daily basis. Effectiveness was included by selecting three clinical studies. Side effects, hospitalizations and visits were valued by referring to national formularies. Utility data were used to differentiate the health status inherent to BTcP. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of transnasal fentanyl citrate is 10,140 euros/QALY. Sensitivity analysis shows that with a threshold of 30,000 euros/QALY, the treatment of BTcP with transnasal fentanyl citrate would have an 86% probability of being cost-effective.

13552,Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure to manage obstructive sleep apnea in patients with type 2 diabetes in the U.K,"OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to manage obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the perspective of the U.K.'s National Health Service (NHS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a case-control design, 150 CPAP-treated patients with OSA and T2D were randomly selected from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (a nationally representative database of patients registered with general practitioners in the U.K.) and matched with 150 OSA and T2D patients from the same database who were not treated with CPAP. The total NHS cost and outcomes of patient management in both groups over 5 years and the cost-effectiveness of CPAP compared with no CPAP treatment were estimated. RESULTS: Using CPAP was associated with significantly lower blood pressure at 5 years and increasingly lower HbA1c levels over 5 consecutive years compared with untreated OSA patients. At 5 years, the HbA1c level in the CPAP-treated group was 8.2% (66.0 mmol/mol) vs. 12.1% (108.4 mmol/mol) in the control group (P < 0.03). Use of CPAP significantly increased patients' health status by 0.27 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient over 5 years (P < 0.001) and NHS management costs by pound4,141 per patient over 5 years; the cost per QALY gained with CPAP was pound15,337. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating treatment with CPAP in OSA patients with T2D leads to significantly lower blood pressure and better controlled diabetes and affords a cost-effective use of NHS resources.

13553,Cost-effectiveness of metformin plus vildagliptin compared with metformin plus sulphonylurea for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a Portuguese healthcare system perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vildagliptin plus metformin vs generic sulphonylurea plus metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, not controlled with metformin, from a Portuguese healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was constructed using risk equations from the UK Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model with a 10,000-patient cohort and a lifetime horizon. The model predicted microvascular and macrovascular complications and mortality in yearly cycles. Patients entered the model as metformin monotherapy failures and switched to alternative treatments (metformin plus basal-bolus insulin and subsequently metformin plus intensive insulin) when glycated hemoglobin A1c >7.5% was reached. Baseline patient characteristics and clinical variables were derived from a Portuguese epidemiological study. Cost estimates were based on direct medical costs only. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: There were fewer non-fatal diabetes-related adverse events (AEs) in patients treated with metformin plus vildagliptin compared with patients treated with metformin plus sulphonylurea (6752 vs 6815). Addition of vildagliptin compared with sulphonylurea led to increased drug acquisition costs but reduced costs of AEs, managing morbidities, and monitoring patients. Treatment with metformin plus vildagliptin yielded a mean per-patient gain of 0.1279 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a mean per-patient increase in total cost of euro1161, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro9072 per QALY. Univariate analyses showed that ICER values were robust and ranged from euro4195 to euro16,052 per QALY when different parameters were varied.

13554,Cost-effectiveness of a 14-gene risk score assay to target adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer,"Life Technologies has developed a 14-gene molecular assay that provides information about the risk of death in early stage non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer patients after surgery. The assay can be used to identify patients at highest risk of mortality, informing subsequent treatments. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this novel assay. Patients and Methods. We developed a Markov model to estimate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs for testing versus standard care. Risk-group classification was based on assay-validation studies, and chemotherapy uptake was based on pre- and post-testing recommendations from a study of 58 physicians. We evaluated three chemotherapy-benefit scenarios: moderately predictive (base case), nonpredictive (i.e., the same benefit for each risk group), and strongly predictive. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results. In the base case, testing and standard-care strategies resulted in 6.81 and 6.66 life years, 3.76 and 3.68 QALYs, and $122,400 and $118,800 in costs, respectively. The ICER was $23,200 per QALY (stage I: $29,200 per QALY; stage II: $12,200 per QALY). The ICER ranged from ""dominant"" to $92,100 per QALY in the strongly predictive and nonpredictive scenarios. The model was most sensitive to the proportion of high-risk patients receiving chemotherapy and the high-risk hazard ratio. The 14-gene risk score assay strategy was cost-effective in 68% of simulations. Conclusion. Our results suggest that the 14-gene risk score assay may be a cost-effective alternative to standard guideline-based adjuvant chemotherapy decision making in early stage non-small cell lung cancer.",2014-01-16783,24710309,Oncologist,Joshua A Roth,2014,19 / 5,466-76,No,24710309,"Joshua A Roth; Paul Billings; Scott D Ramsey; Robert Dumanois; Josh J Carlson; Cost-effectiveness of a 14-gene risk score assay to target adjuvant chemotherapy in early stage non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Oncologist, ; 19(5):1083-7159; 466-76",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,14-gene risk score strategy to target adjuvant chemotherapy vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,68 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,23200,United States,2013,25774.78
13555,Cost-effectiveness of prolonged exposure therapy versus pharmacotherapy and treatment choice in posttraumatic stress disorder (the Optimizing PTSD Treatment Trial): a doubly randomized preference trial,"OBJECTIVE: Cost-effectiveness of treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may depend on type of treatment (eg, pharmacotherapy vs psychotherapy) and patient choice of treatment. We examined the cost-effectiveness of treatment with prolonged exposure therapy versus pharmacotherapy with sertraline, overall treatment preference, preference for choosing prolonged exposure therapy, and preference for choosing pharmacotherapy with sertraline from the US societal perspective. METHOD: Two hundred patients aged 18 to 65 years with PTSD diagnosis based on DSM-IV criteria enrolled in a doubly randomized preference trial. Patients were randomized to receive their treatment of choice (n = 97) or to be randomly assigned treatment (n = 103). In the choice arm, patients chose either prolonged exposure therapy (n = 61) or pharmacotherapy with sertraline (n = 36). In the no-choice arm, patients were randomized to either prolonged exposure therapy (n = 48) or pharmacotherapy with sertraline (n = 55). The total costs, including direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs, were estimated in 2012 US dollars; and total quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was assessed using the EuroQoL Questionnaire-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) instrument in a 12-month period. This study was conducted from July 2004 to January 2009. RESULTS: Relative to pharmacotherapy with sertraline, prolonged exposure therapy was less costly (-$262; 95% CI, -$5,068 to $4,946) and produced more QALYs (0.056; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.100) when treatment was assigned, with 93.2% probability of being cost-effective at $100,000/QALY. Independently, giving a choice of treatment also yielded lower cost (-$1,826; 95% CI, -$4,634 to $749) and more QALYs (0.010; 95% CI, -0.019 to 0.044) over no choice of treatment, with 87.0% probability of cost-effectiveness at $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Giving PTSD patients a choice of treatment appears to be cost-effective. When choice is not possible, prolonged exposure therapy may provide a cost-effective option over pharmacotherapy with sertraline.

13559,Cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis treatment strategies for febrile neutropenia in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (PP) or secondary prophylaxis (SP) with pegfilgrastim, filgrastim (6-day and 11-day), or no prophylaxis to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer receiving docetaxel or topotecan. METHODS: A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PP vs SP from a US payer perspective. Model inputs, including the efficacy of each strategy (relative risk of FN with prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis) and mortality, costs, and utility values were estimated from public sources and peer-reviewed publications. Incremental cost-effectiveness was evaluated in terms of net cost per FN event avoided, incremental cost per life-year saved (LYS), and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over a lifetime horizon. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) were conducted. RESULTS: For patients receiving docetaxel, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for PP vs SP with pegfilgrastim was $7900 per QALY gained, and PP with pegfilgrastim dominated all other comparators. For patients receiving topotecan, PP with pegfilgrastim dominated all comparators. Model results were most sensitive to baseline FN risk. PP vs SP with pegfilgrastim was cost effective in 68% and 83% of simulations for docetaxel and in >99% of simulations for topotecan at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per QALY.

OBJECTIVE: To learn which graft or hardware option used in a single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is most beneficial in terms of cost, quality of life, and overall cost effectiveness. Options studied were autograft, allograft, and polyetheretherketone (PEEK) cages for cervical fusion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: ACDF is commonly used to treat cervical myelopathy and/or radiculopathy. No study has compared the cost effectiveness of autograft, allograft, and PEEK in 1-level ACDF. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature review provided inputs into a Markov decision model to determine the most effective graft or hardware option for 1-level ACDF. Data regarding rate of complications, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and cost for each procedure type was collected. The Markov model was first run in a base case, using all currently available data. The model was then tested using 1-way and 2-way sensitivity analyses to determine the validity of the model''s conclusions if specific aspects of model were changed. This model was run for 10 years postoperatively. RESULTS: The cost per QALY for each option in the base case analysis was $3328/QALY for PEEK, $2492/QALY for autograft, and $2492/QALY for allograft. All graft/hardware options are cost effective ways to improve outcomes for patients living with chronic neck pain. For graft/hardware options the most cost-effective option was allograft.

13563,Cost-effectiveness and equity impacts of three HPV vaccination programmes for school-aged girls in New Zealand,"BACKGROUND: As with many high-income countries, vaccination coverage against human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is not high in New Zealand (NZ) at 47% in school-aged girls for three doses. We estimate the health gains, net-cost and cost-effectiveness of the currently implemented HPV national vaccination programme of vaccination dispersed across schools and primary care, and two alternatives: school-based only (assumed coverage as per Australia: 73%), and mandatory school-based vaccination but with opt-out permitted (coverage 93%). We also generate estimates by social group (sex, ethnic and deprivation group). METHODS: A Markov macro-simulation model was developed for 12-year-old girls and boys in 2011, with future health states of: cervical cancer, pre-cancer (CIN I-III), genital warts, and three other HPV-related cancers (oropharyngeal, anal, vulvar cancer). In each state health sector costs, including additional health sector costs from extra life, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were accumulated. RESULTS: The current HPV vaccination programme has an estimated cost-effectiveness of NZ$18,800/QALY gained (about US$9700/QALY gained using the OECD''s purchasing power parities; 95% UI: US$6900 to $33,700) compared to the status quo in NZ prior to 2008 (no vaccination, screening alone). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of an intensive school-based only programme of girls, compared to the current situation, was US$33,000/QALY gained. Mandatory vaccination appeared least cost-effective (ICER compared to school-based of US$117,000/QALY gained, but with wide 95% uncertainty limits from $56,000 to $220,000). All interventions generated more QALYs per 12-year-old for Maori (indigenous population) and people living in deprived areas (range 5-25% greater QALYs gained). INTERPRETATION: A more intensive school-only vaccination programme seems warranted.

13564,Cost-effectiveness and equity impacts of three HPV vaccination programmes for school-aged girls in New Zealand,"BACKGROUND: As with many high-income countries, vaccination coverage against human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is not high in New Zealand (NZ) at 47% in school-aged girls for three doses. We estimate the health gains, net-cost and cost-effectiveness of the currently implemented HPV national vaccination programme of vaccination dispersed across schools and primary care, and two alternatives: school-based only (assumed coverage as per Australia: 73%), and mandatory school-based vaccination but with opt-out permitted (coverage 93%). We also generate estimates by social group (sex, ethnic and deprivation group). METHODS: A Markov macro-simulation model was developed for 12-year-old girls and boys in 2011, with future health states of: cervical cancer, pre-cancer (CIN I-III), genital warts, and three other HPV-related cancers (oropharyngeal, anal, vulvar cancer). In each state health sector costs, including additional health sector costs from extra life, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were accumulated. RESULTS: The current HPV vaccination programme has an estimated cost-effectiveness of NZ$18,800/QALY gained (about US$9700/QALY gained using the OECD''s purchasing power parities; 95% UI: US$6900 to $33,700) compared to the status quo in NZ prior to 2008 (no vaccination, screening alone). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of an intensive school-based only programme of girls, compared to the current situation, was US$33,000/QALY gained. Mandatory vaccination appeared least cost-effective (ICER compared to school-based of US$117,000/QALY gained, but with wide 95% uncertainty limits from $56,000 to $220,000). All interventions generated more QALYs per 12-year-old for Maori (indigenous population) and people living in deprived areas (range 5-25% greater QALYs gained).

13566,Applying quality assurance in real time to compliant long-term periodontal maintenance patients utilizing cost-effectiveness and cost utility,"BACKGROUND: Little work has been done on quality assurance of long-term maintenance of periodontal therapy MATERIALS/METHODS: A quality assurance model was applied to 80 patients (50 females, 30 males) with an average age of 64.3 years (SD. 8.83, range 45-91) and with 21.6 (SD. 2.65, range 16-26) maintenance years. The main elements were patients'' expectations, objectives and patient-based outcomes, human and financial costs and treatment deviations. For cost-effectiveness, this group was compared with a control group of 25 patients with an average of 9.96 years not complying with maintenance therapy. RESULTS: The patients'' main expectations and reasons for seeking treatment were to save teeth and a desire for better oral health. The patients had a total tooth-year loss of 3.3%. 81.3% reported improved oral health. Total treatment discounted cost was euro5842. The cost of buying an extra tooth year was euro20.2. Patients reported anxiety of 4.6 (SD10.5, range 0-47) and discomfort of 11.8 (SD13.2 range 0-70) for the maintenance visits on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Treatment deviations showed 3.8% extreme downhill patients, 6.3% with poor oral hygiene, 3.8% reported a worsening of their oral health, 3.8% had high anxiety whereas 5.0% experienced a high level of discomfort.

A recent cost utility analysis of caudal epidural injections in managing chronic low back pain of various pathologies showed a high cost utility with improvement in quality of life years, competitive with various other modalities of treatments. However, there are no analyses derived from high-quality controlled studies related to the cost utility of percutaneous adhesiolysis in the treatment of post-lumbar surgery syndrome or lumbar central spinal stenosis. STUDY DESIGN: This analysis is based on 2 previously published controlled studies. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost utility of percutaneous adhesiolysis procedures in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain secondary to post-lumbar surgery syndrome and lumbar central spinal stenosis. SETTING: A private, specialty referral interventional pain management center in the United States. METHODS: Two controlled studies were conducted assessing the clinical effectiveness of percutaneous adhesiolysis for post-lumbar surgery syndrome and lumbar central spinal stenosis in an interventional pain management setting utilizing contemporary interventional pain management practices. A cost utility analysis was performed with direct payment data for a total of 130 patients in treatment groups over a 2-year period. Various outcome measures were included with significant improvement, defined as at least 50% improvement with reduction in pain and disability status. RESULTS: The results of 2 controlled studies of low back pain with 60 and 70 patients and a 2-year follow-up with the actual reimbursement data showed cost utility for 1 year of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of USD $2,652 for post-lumbar surgery syndrome and USD $2,649 for lumbar central spinal stenosis.

13569,A United Kingdom-based economic evaluation of ranibizumab for patients with retinal vein occlusion (RVO),"OBJECTIVE: This study compares the cost-effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab vs observation and/or laser photocoagulation for treatment of macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion in a UK-based model. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using transition probabilities and frequency of adverse events derived using data from the BRAVO, CRUISE, and HORIZON trials. Outcomes associated with treatments and health states were combined to predict overall health costs and outcomes for cohorts treated with each option. RESULTS: In branch retinal vein occlusion, ranibizumab produced a gain of 0.518 quality-adjusted life years at an incremental cost of pound8141, compared with laser photocoagulation. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound15,710 per quality-adjusted life year, and the incremental cost per month free from blindness was pound658. In central retinal vein occlusion, ranibizumab produced a gain of 0.539 quality-adjusted life years at an incremental cost of pound9216, compared with observation only. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound17,103, and the incremental cost per month free from blindness was pound423. CONCLUSIONS: These incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are below the pound20,000-30,000 range typically accepted as a threshold for cost-effectiveness. This suggests that ranibizumab may be regarded as a cost-effective therapy for patients with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion, relative to grid laser photocoagulation (for BRVO) and observation (for CRVO). Limitations include sparse data for utilities associated with the severity of visual impairment in the WSE in patients with RVO.

13571,Real-life treatment paradigms show infliximab is cost-effective for management of ulcerative colitis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Infliximab is effective for induction and maintenance of response in patients with moderate to moderately severe ulcerative colitis. Previous cost analyses of infliximab treatment for ulcerative colitis used models of colectomy vs infliximab and response rates derived from early clinical trials. In real life, therapeutic options are more complex; patients frequently choose to remain in an unwell state rather than undergo colectomy, and rates of response to infliximab are generally higher than those reported from clinical trials. We evaluate the real-life cost-effectiveness of infliximab for treatment of ulcerative colitis where infliximab was readily available compared with not available, causing patients to remain in unwell states. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate disease progression of patients with moderate or moderately severe ulcerative colitis who depended on corticosteroids and/or did not respond to thiopurine therapy. Utility scores and transition probabilities between health states were determined by using data from randomized controlled trials and real-life rates published by expert inflammatory bowel disease centers. Health care costs were obtained from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative and the Alberta Health Schedule of Medical Benefits documents. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for infliximab treatment of ulcerative colitis were $79,000 and $64,000 per quality-adjusted life year, compared with ongoing medical therapy, at 5-year and 10-year treatment time horizons, respectively.

13572,Cost analysis of sofosbuvir/ribavirin versus sofosbuvir/simeprevir for genotype 1 hepatitis C virus in interferon-ineligible/intolerant individuals,"Treatment guidance for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) released by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) offers two options for interferon (IFN)-ineligible/intolerant individuals with genotype 1 infection: sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SOF/RBV) for 24 weeks or sofosbuvir/simeprevir (SOF/SMV) for 12 weeks. A 24-week course of SOF/RBV costs approximately US$169,000, with sustained virologic response (SVR) rates ranging from 52% to 84%; 12 weeks of SOF/SMV costs approximately $150,000, with SVR between 89% and 100%. Because SOF/SMV is currently used off-label, debate exists among physicians and payers about whether it should be prescribed and covered. This article presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of these two treatment regimens accounting for costs of drugs, treatment-related medical care, retreatment for individuals who do not achieve SVR, and natural history of continued HCV infection after failed retreatment. Analysis uses a Markov model with a lifetime horizon and a societal perspective. In the base-case scenario, SOF/SMV dominated SOF/RBV in a modeled 50-year-old cohort of treatment-naive and -experienced subjects, excluding those who failed earlier therapy with telaprevir or boceprevir. SOF/SMV yielded lower costs and more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for the average subject, compared to SOF/RBV ($165,336 and 14.69 QALYs vs. $243,586 and 14.45 QALYs, respectively). In base-case cost analysis, the SOF/SMV treatment strategy saved $91,590 per SVR, compared to SOF/RBV. Under all one-way sensitivity scenarios, SOF/SMV remained dominant and resulted in cost savings. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a 12-week course of SOF/SMV is a more cost-effective treatment for genotype 1 CHC than 24 weeks of SOF/RBV among IFN-ineligible/intolerant individuals, supporting the AASLD/IDSA guidance and offering implications for both clinical and regulatory decision making as well as pharmaceutical pricing.",2014-01-16819,24677184,Hepatology,Liesl M Hagan,2014,60 / 1,37-45,No,24677184,"Liesl M Hagan; Mark S Sulkowski; Raymond F Schinazi; Cost analysis of sofosbuvir/ribavirin versus sofosbuvir/simeprevir for genotype 1 hepatitis C virus in interferon-ineligible/intolerant individuals, Hepatology, ; 60(1):0270-9139; 37-45",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sofosbuvir/simeprevir (SOF/SMV) for 12 weeks vs. Sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SOF/RBV) for 24 weeks,interferon-ineligible/intolerant individuals,64 Years,41 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-327166.67,United States,2013,-363476.23
13573,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a collaborative care programme for depression in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Collaborative care programmes lead to better outcomes in the management of depression. A programme of this nature has demonstrated its effectiveness in primary care in Spain. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this programme compared to usual care. METHODS: A bottom-up cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted within a randomized controlled trial (2007-2010). The intervention consisted of a collaborative care programme with clinical, educational and organizational procedures. Outcomes were monitored over a 12 months period. Primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER): mean differences in costs divided by quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and mean differences in costs divided by depression-free days (DFD). Analyses were performed from a healthcare system perspective (considering healthcare costs) and from a society perspective (including healthcare costs plus loss of productivity costs). RESULTS: Three hundred and thirty-eight adult patients with major depression were assessed at baseline. Only patients with complete data were included in the primary analysis (166 in the intervention group and 126 in the control group). From a healthcare perspective, the average incremental cost of the programme compared to usual care was euro182.53 (p<0.001). Incremental effectiveness was 0.045 QALY (p=0.017) and 40.09 DFD (p=0.011). ICERs were euro4,056/QALY and euro4.55/DFD. These estimates and their uncertainty are graphically represented in the cost-effectiveness plane. LIMITATIONS: The amount of 13.6% of patients with incomplete data may have introduced a bias. Available data about non-healthcare costs were limited, although they may represent most of the total cost of depression. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention yields better outcomes than usual care with a modest increase in costs, resulting in favourable ICERs.

13574,Prevention of gram-positive infections in peritoneal dialysis patients in Hong Kong: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Gram-positive bacteria are the major causative pathogens of peritonitis and exit site infection in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). We investigated the cost-effectiveness of regular application of mupirocin at the exit site in PD recipients from the perspective of health care providers in Hong Kong. METHODS: A decision tree was designed to simulate outcomes of incident PD patients with and without regular application of mupirocin over a 1-year period. Outcome measures included total direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and gram-positive infection-related mortality rate. Model inputs were derived from the literature. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of uncertainty in all model variables. RESULTS: In a base case analysis, the mupirocin group had a higher expected QALY value (0.6496 vs 0.6456), a lower infection-related mortality rate (0.18% vs 1.64%), and a lower total cost per patient (US $258 vs $1661) compared with the control group. The rate of gram-positive peritonitis without mupirocin and the risk of gram-positive peritonitis with mupirocin were influential factors.

We looked for the most cost-effective method of identifying diabetic macular oedema from retinal photographs including the role of automated grading and optical coherence tomography, a technology that directly visualises oedema. METHODS: Patients from seven UK centres were recruited. The following features in at least one eye were required for enrolment: microaneurysms/dot haemorrhages or blot haemorrhages within one disc diameter, or exudates within one or two disc diameters of the centre of the macula. Subjects had optical coherence tomography and digital photography. Manual and automated grading schemes were evaluated. Costs and QALYs were modelled using microsimulation techniques. RESULTS: 3540 patients were recruited, 3170 were analysed. For diabetic macular oedema, England''s scheme had a sensitivity of 72.6% and specificity of 66.8%; Scotland''s had a sensitivity of 59.5% and specificity of 79.0%.

13580,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an awareness campaign for colorectal cancer: a mathematical modeling study,"BACKGROUND: A campaign to increase the awareness of the signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer (CRC) and encourage self-presentation to a GP was piloted in two regions of England in 2011. Short-term data from the pilot evaluation on campaign cost and changes in GP attendances/referrals, CRC incidence, and CRC screening uptake were available. The objective was to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a CRC awareness campaign by using a mathematical model which extrapolates short-term outcomes to predict long-term impacts on cancer mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs. METHODS: A mathematical model representing England (aged 30+) for a lifetime horizon was developed. Long-term changes to cancer incidence, cancer stage distribution, cancer mortality, and QALYs were estimated. Costs were estimated incorporating costs associated with delivering the campaign, additional GP attendances, and changes in CRC treatment. RESULTS: Data from the pilot campaign suggested that the awareness campaign caused a 1-month 10 % increase in presentation rates. Based on this, the model predicted the campaign to cost pound5.5 million, prevent 66 CRC deaths and gain 404 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to ""no campaign"" was pound13,496 per QALY. Results were sensitive to the magnitude and duration of the increase in presentation rates and to disease stage. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a cancer awareness campaign can be estimated based on short-term data. Such predictions will aid policy makers in prioritizing between cancer control strategies.

13585,Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention in South Africa,"BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) are effective in reducing HIV transmission in heterosexual adults. The epidemiologic impact and cost-effectiveness of combined prevention approaches in resource-limited settings remain unclear. METHODS: We develop a dynamic mathematical model of the HIV epidemic in South Africa''s adult population. We assume ART reduces HIV transmission by 95% and PrEP by 60%. We model two ART strategies: scaling up access for those with CD4 counts </= 350 cells/muL (Guidelines) and for all identified HIV-infected individuals (Universal). PrEP strategies include use in the general population (General) and in high-risk individuals (Focused). We consider strategies where ART, PrEP, or both are scaled up to 100% of remaining eligible individuals yearly. We measure infections averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios over 20 years. RESULTS: Scaling up ART to 50% of eligible individuals averts 1,513,000 infections over 20 years (Guidelines) and 3,591,000 infections (Universal). Universal ART is the most cost-effective strategy at any scale ($160-$220/QALY versus comparable scale Guidelines ART expansion). General PrEP is costly and provides limited benefits beyond ART scale-up ($7,680/QALY to add 100% PrEP to 50% Universal ART). Cost-effectiveness of General PrEP becomes less favorable when ART is widely given ($12,640/QALY gained when added to 100% Universal ART). If feasible, Focused PrEP is cost saving or highly cost effective versus status quo and when added to ART strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Expanded ART coverage to individuals in early disease stages may be more cost-effective than current guidelines. PrEP can be cost-saving if delivered to individuals at increased risk of infection.",2014-01-16833,24629217,BMC Med,Sabina S Alistar,2014,12 /,46,No,24629217,"Sabina S Alistar; Philip M Grant; Eran Bendavid; Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV prevention in South Africa, BMC Med, ; 12():1741-7015; 46",QALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Not Stated,Antiretroviral therapy (ART) and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention (scaling access for CD4 counts = 350 cells/µL) vs. None,Not Stated,64 Years,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,413,United States,2012,465.56
13586,Cost-effectiveness of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy for prevention of contralateral breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: A growing number of women with sporadic unilateral, early-stage breast cancers are undergoing ipsilateral therapeutic mastectomy with contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM) to prevent the development of new cancers in the contralateral breast. METHODS: A decision-tree using TreeAge Pro 2012 software was used to model the costs and effects of CPM versus unilateral mastectomy (UM) in women younger than 50 years of age with sporadic unilateral, early stage breast cancers. Cost estimates were obtained from the Medicare Fee Schedule and the Healthcare Utilization Project. Probability estimates were obtained from the literature. Outcome effects were measured by incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. A 10-year risk period for contralateral breast cancer (CBC), a lifetime time horizon, and a societal perspective were used. RESULTS: Treatment with CPM results in 0.2 QALYs less than UM and $279 less in costs during a 10-year risk period and lifetime follow-up. The resulting incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) is a savings of $1397 per QALY lost. The ICER is sensitive to the rate and method of postmastectomy reconstruction and the cost of radiologic surveillance after UM. CONCLUSIONS: CPM is cost-saving for the prevention of CBC in women younger than 50 years of age with sporadic, unilateral, early-stage breast cancers, but also reduces resulting health.

13587,The cost effectiveness of ivabradine in the treatment of chronic heart failure from the U.K. National Health Service perspective,"OBJECTIVE: Ivabradine, a specific heart rate lowering therapy, has been shown in a randomised placebo-controlled study, Systolic HF Treatment with the If Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial (SHIfT), to significantly reduce the composite end point of cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for worsening heart failure (HF) in patients with systolic HF who are in sinus rhythm and with a heart rate >/=70 bpm, when added to optimised medical therapy (HR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.90, p<0.0001). We assessed the cost effectiveness of ivabradine, from a UK National Health Service perspective, based on the results of SHIfT. METHODS: A Markov model estimated the cost effectiveness of ivabradine compared with standard care for two cohorts of patients with HF (heart rate >/=75 bpm in line with the EU labelled indication; and heart rate >/=70 bpm in line with the SHIfT study population). Modelled outcomes included death, hospitalisation, quality of life and New York Heart Association class. Total costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for ivabradine and standard care were estimated over a lifetime horizon.

13588,The cost effectiveness of ivabradine in the treatment of chronic heart failure from the U.K. National Health Service perspective,"OBJECTIVE: Ivabradine, a specific heart rate lowering therapy, has been shown in a randomised placebo-controlled study, Systolic HF Treatment with the If Inhibitor Ivabradine Trial (SHIfT), to significantly reduce the composite end point of cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for worsening heart failure (HF) in patients with systolic HF who are in sinus rhythm and with a heart rate >/=70 bpm, when added to optimised medical therapy (HR: 0.82, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.90, p<0.0001). We assessed the cost effectiveness of ivabradine, from a UK National Health Service perspective, based on the results of SHIfT. METHODS: A Markov model estimated the cost effectiveness of ivabradine compared with standard care for two cohorts of patients with HF (heart rate >/=75 bpm in line with the EU labelled indication; and heart rate >/=70 bpm in line with the SHIfT study population). Modelled outcomes included death, hospitalisation, quality of life and New York Heart Association class. Total costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) for ivabradine and standard care were estimated over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: The incremental cost per additional QALY for ivabradine plus standard care versus standard care has been estimated as pound8498 for heart rate >/=75 bpm and pound13 764 for heart rate >/=70 bpm.

13589,Cost-utility analysis of dasatinib and nilotinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia refractory to first-line treatment with imatinib in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Recently, the second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors dasatinib and nilotinib have emerged as alternative treatments in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) who are resistant to or intolerant of imatinib. OBJECTIVE: This article aimed to assess the cost utility and budget impact of using dasatinib or nilotinib, rather than high-dose (800-mg/d) imatinib, in patients with chronic phase (CP) CML who are resistant to standard-dose (400-mg/d) imatinib in Thailand. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was developed and used to estimate the lifetime costs and outcomes of treating patients aged >/=38 years with CP-CML. The efficacy parameters were synthesized from a systematic review. Utilities using the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions tool and costs were obtained from the Thai CML population. Costs and outcomes were compared and presented as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in 2011 Thai baht (THB) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, treatment with dasatinib was found to yield more QALYs (2.13) at a lower cost (THB 1,631,331) per person than high-dose imatinib. Nilotinib treatment was also found to be more cost-effective than high-dose imatinib, producing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of THB 83,328 per QALY gained. This treatment option also resulted in the highest number of QALYs gained of all of the treatment options. The costs of providing dasatinib, nilotinib, and high-dose imatinib were estimated at THB 5 billion, THB 6 billion, and THB 7 billion, respectively.

13591,Core discrete event simulation model for the evaluation of health care technologies in major depressive disorder,"OBJECTIVE: A review of existing economic models in major depressive disorder (MDD) highlighted the need for models with longer time horizons that also account for heterogeneity in treatment pathways between patients. A core discrete event simulation model was developed to estimate health and cost outcomes associated with alternative treatment strategies. METHODS: This model simulated short- and long-term clinical events (partial response, remission, relapse, recovery, and recurrence), adverse events, and treatment changes (titration, switch, addition, and discontinuation) over up to 5 years. Several treatment pathways were defined on the basis of fictitious antidepressants with three levels of efficacy, tolerability, and price (low, medium, and high) from first line to third line. The model was populated with input data from the literature for the UK setting. Model outputs include time in different health states, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs from National Health Service and societal perspectives. The codes are open source. RESULTS: Predicted costs and QALYs from this model are within the range of results from previous economic evaluations. The largest cost components from the payer perspective were physician visits and hospitalizations. Key parameters driving the predicted costs and QALYs were utility values, effectiveness, and frequency of physician visits. Differences in QALYs and costs between two strategies with different effectiveness increased approximately twofold when the time horizon increased from 1 to 5 years. CONCLUSION: The discrete event simulation model can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of different therapeutic options in MDD, compared with existing Markov models, and can be used to compare a wide range of health care technologies in various groups of patients with MDD.",2014-01-16843,24636376,Value Health,Anne-Lise Vataire,2014,17 / 2,183-95,Yes,24636376,"Anne-Lise Vataire; Samuel Aballea; Fernando Antonanzas; Leona Hakkaart-van Roijen; Raymond W Lam; Paul McCrone; Ulf Persson; Mondher Toumi; Core discrete event simulation model for the evaluation of health care technologies in major depressive disorder, Value Health, ; 17(2):1098-3015; 183-95",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Strategy with high effectiveness and high price vs. Strategy with low effectiveness and low price,Not Stated,74 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, flexible",3.50,3.50,-3115.38,United Kingdom,2011,-5750.63
13592,Cost-effectiveness of statins for primary prevention in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Statins are lipid-lowering drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine whether statin treatment for primary prevention in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes is cost-effective, taking nonadherence, baseline risk, and age into account. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by using a Markov model with a time horizon of 10 years. The baseline 10-year cardiovascular risk was estimated in a Dutch population of primary prevention patients with newly diagnosed diabetes from the Groningen Initiative to Analyse Type 2 Diabetes Treatment (GIANTT) database, using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study risk engine. Statin adherence was measured as pill days covered in the IADB.nl pharmacy research database. Cost-effectiveness was measured in costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from the health care payers'' perspective. RESULTS: For an average patient aged 60 years, the base case, statin treatment was highly cost-effective at euro2245 per QALY. Favorable cost-effectiveness was robust in sensitivity analysis. Differences in age and 10-year cardiovascular risk showed large differences in cost-effectiveness from almost euro100,000 per QALY to almost being cost saving. Treating all patients younger than 45 years at diabetes diagnosis was not cost-effective (weighted cost-effectiveness of almost euro60,000 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the nonadherence levels observed in actual practice, statin treatment is cost-effective for primary prevention in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Because of large differences in cost-effectiveness according to different risk and age groups, the efficiency of the treatment could be increased by targeting patients with relatively higher cardiovascular risk and higher ages.",2014-01-16845,24636380,Value Health,Folgerdiena M de Vries,2014,17 / 2,223-30,Yes,24636380,"Folgerdiena M de Vries; Petra Denig; Sipke T Visser; Eelko Hak; Maarten J Postma; Cost-effectiveness of statins for primary prevention in patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands, Value Health, ; 17(2):1098-3015; 223-30",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Statin treatment for primay prevention vs. Statin treatment in patients at low risk,newly diagnosed,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,10 Years,4.00,1.50,2245,Euro,2012,3254.15
13593,Cost effectiveness of a pharmacist-led information technology intervention for reducing rates of clinically important errors in medicines management in general practices (PINCER),"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We recently showed that a pharmacist-led information technology-based intervention (PINCER) was significantly more effective in reducing medication errors in general practices than providing simple feedback on errors, with cost per error avoided at pound79 (US$131). We aimed to estimate cost effectiveness of the PINCER intervention by combining effectiveness in error reduction and intervention costs with the effect of the individual errors on patient outcomes and healthcare costs, to estimate the effect on costs and QALYs. METHODS: We developed Markov models for each of six medication errors targeted by PINCER. Clinical event probability, treatment pathway, resource use and costs were extracted from literature and costing tariffs. A composite probabilistic model combined patient-level error models with practice-level error rates and intervention costs from the trial. Cost per extra QALY and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated from the perspective of NHS England, with a 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: The PINCER intervention generated pound2,679 less cost and 0.81 more QALYs per practice [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): - pound3,037 per QALY] in the deterministic analysis. In the probabilistic analysis, PINCER generated 0.001 extra QALYs per practice compared with simple feedback, at pound4.20 less per practice. Despite this extremely small set of differences in costs and outcomes, PINCER dominated simple feedback with a mean ICER of - pound3,936 (standard error pound2,970). At a ceiling ''willingness-to-pay'' of pound20,000/QALY, PINCER reaches 59 % probability of being cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: PINCER produced marginal health gain at slightly reduced overall cost.

It remains to be seen whether dabigatran will be cost effective in a practice environment where warfarin is significantly underused and the costs of both warfarin and international normalized ration INR monitoring are cheap. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis with a Markov model to evaluate the value of dabigatran to prevent stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) in Taiwan. Dabigatran was given through sequential dosing, where patients<80 years old received 150 mg of dabigatran twice a day and the dosage was reduced to 110 mgs for patients >/= 80 years old. Dabigatran was compared with warfarin under two scenarios: the ""real-world adjusted-dose warfarin"" assuming all AF patients eligible for warfarin were given the medication and maintained at the INR observed in routine clinical practice in Taiwan, and the ""real-world prescribing behaviour"" similar to the treatment with antithrombotics in real-world practice in Taiwan, where eligible patients could receive warfarin, aspirin, or no treatment. RESULTS: The percentage of AF patients who received warfarin, aspirin or no treatment in Taiwan was 16%, 62% and 22%, respectively. The event rates of ischemic stroke per 100 patient-years were 4.5, 8.0, and 6.0 for sequential dabigatran, real-world prescribing behaviour and real-world warfarin use, respectively.

13598,Should we await IFN-free regimens to treat HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive patients? A cost-effectiveness analysis (ANRS 95141),"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In treatment-naive patients mono-infected with genotype 1 chronic HCV, treatments with telaprevir/boceprevir (TVR/BOC)-based triple therapy are standard-of-care. However, more efficacious direct-acting antivirals (IFN-based new DAAs) are available and interferon-free (IFN-free) regimens are imminent (2015). METHODS: A mathematical model estimated quality-adjusted life years, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of (i) IFN-based new DAAs vs. TVR/BOC-based triple therapy; and (ii) IFN-based new DAAs initiation strategies, given that IFN-free regimens are imminent. The sustained virological response in F3-4/F0-2 was 71/89% with IFN-based new DAAs, 85/95% with IFN-free regimens, vs. 64/80% with TVR/BOC-based triple therapy. Serious adverse events leading to discontinuation were taken as: 0-0.6% with IFN-based new DAAs, 0% with IFN-free regimens, vs. 1-10% with TVR/BOC-based triple therapy. Costs were euro60,000 for 12weeks of IFN-based new DAAs and two times higher for IFN-free regimens. RESULTS: Treatment with IFN-based new DAAs when fibrosis stage F2 is cost-effective compared to TVR/BOC-based triple therapy (euro37,900/QALY gained), but not at F0-1 (euro103,500/QALY gained). Awaiting the IFN-free regimens is more effective, except in F4 patients, but not cost-effective compared to IFN-based new DAAs. If we decrease the cost of IFN-free regimens close to that of IFN-based new DAAs, then awaiting the IFN-free regimen becomes cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IFN-based new DAAs at stage F2 is both effective and cost-effective compared to TVR/BOC triple therapy.

METHODS: A mathematical model estimated quality-adjusted life years, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of (i) IFN-based new DAAs vs. TVR/BOC-based triple therapy; and (ii) IFN-based new DAAs initiation strategies, given that IFN-free regimens are imminent. The sustained virological response in F3-4/F0-2 was 71/89% with IFN-based new DAAs, 85/95% with IFN-free regimens, vs. 64/80% with TVR/BOC-based triple therapy. Serious adverse events leading to discontinuation were taken as: 0-0.6% with IFN-based new DAAs, 0% with IFN-free regimens, vs. 1-10% with TVR/BOC-based triple therapy. Costs were euro60,000 for 12weeks of IFN-based new DAAs and two times higher for IFN-free regimens. RESULTS: Treatment with IFN-based new DAAs when fibrosis stage F2 is cost-effective compared to TVR/BOC-based triple therapy (euro37,900/QALY gained), but not at F0-1 (euro103,500/QALY gained). Awaiting the IFN-free regimens is more effective, except in F4 patients, but not cost-effective compared to IFN-based new DAAs. If we decrease the cost of IFN-free regimens close to that of IFN-based new DAAs, then awaiting the IFN-free regimen becomes cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IFN-based new DAAs at stage F2 is both effective and cost-effective compared to TVR/BOC triple therapy. Awaiting IFN-free regimens and then treating regardless of fibrosis is more efficacious, except in F4 patients; however, the cost-effectiveness of this strategy is highly dependent on its cost.",2014-01-16864,24650691,J Hepatol,Sylvie Deuffic-Burban,2014,61 / 1,7-14,No,24650691,"Sylvie Deuffic-Burban; Michael Schwarzinger; Dorothee Obach; Vincent Mallet; Stanislas Pol; Georges-Philippe Pageaux; Valerie Canva; Pierre Deltenre; Francoise Roudot-Thoraval; Dominique Larrey; Daniel Dhumeaux; Philippe Mathurin; Yazdan Yazdanpanah; Should we await IFN-free regimens to treat HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive patients?
