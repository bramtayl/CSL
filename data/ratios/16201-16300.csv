16201,Portable electronic vision enhancement systems in comparison with optical magnifiers for near vision activities: an economic evaluation alongside a randomized crossover trial,"PURPOSE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of portable electronic vision enhancement system (p-EVES) devices compared with optical low vision aids (LVAs), for improving near vision visual function, quality of life and well-being of people with a visual impairment. METHODS: An AB/BA randomized crossover trial design was used. Eighty-two participants completed the study. Participants were current users of optical LVAs who had not tried a p-EVES device before and had a stable visual impairment. The trial intervention was the addition of a p-EVES device to the participant''s existing optical LVA(s) for 2 months, and the control intervention was optical LVA use only, for 2 months. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were conducted from a societal perspective. RESULTS: The mean cost of the p-EVES intervention was pound448. Carer costs were pound30 (4.46 hr) less for the p-EVES intervention compared with the LVA only control. The mean difference in total costs was pound417. Bootstrapping gave an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound736 (95% CI pound481 to pound1525) for a 7% improvement in near vision visual function. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) ranged from pound56 991 (lower 95% CI = pound19 801) to pound66 490 (lower 95% CI = pound23 055). Sensitivity analysis varying the commercial price of the p-EVES device reduced ICERs by up to 75%, with cost per QALYs falling below pound30 000. CONCLUSION: Portable electronic vision enhancement system (p-EVES) devices are likely to be a cost-effective use of healthcare resources for improving near vision visual function, but this does not translate into cost-effective improvements in quality of life, capability or well-being.",2016-01-22039,27682985,Acta Ophthalmol,Nathan Bray,2016,/,,No,27682985,"Nathan Bray; Andrew Brand; John Taylor; Zoe Hoare; Christine Dickinson; Rhiannon T Edwards; Portable electronic vision enhancement systems in comparison with optical magnifiers for near vision activities: an economic evaluation alongside a randomized crossover trial, Acta Ophthalmol , 2016 Sep 29; ():1755-3768",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Portable Electronic Vision Enhancement System (p-EVES) device vs. Standard/Usual Care- Optical low vision aids (LVAs),Participants were current users of Optical low vision aids (LVAs) who had not tried a Portable Electronic Vision Enhancement System (p-EVES) device before and had a stable visual impairment.,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,56991.43,United Kingdom,2014,102706.96

16203,Cost versus utility of aclidinium bromide 400 microg plus formoterol fumarate dihydrate 12 microg compared to aclidinium bromide 400 microg alone in the management of moderate-to-severe COPD,"PURPOSE: Aclidinium-formoterol 400/12 microg is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and a long-acting beta2-agonist in a fixed-dose combination used in the management of patients with COPD. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of aclidinium-formoterol 400/12 microg against the long-acting muscarinic antagonist aclidinium bromide 400 microg. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A five-health-state Markov transition model with monthly cycles was developed using MS Excel to simulate patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and their initial lung-function improvement following treatment with aclidinium-formoterol 400/12 microg or aclidinium 400 microg. Health states were based on severity levels defined by Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease 2010 criteria. The analysis was a head-to-head comparison without step-up therapy, from the NHS Scotland perspective, over a 5-year time horizon. Clinical data on initial lung-function improvement were provided by a pooled analysis of the ACLIFORM and AUGMENT trials. Management, event costs, and utilities were health state-specific. Costs and effects were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. The outcome of the analysis was expressed as cost (UK pound) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The analysis included one way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of parameter uncertainty on model outputs. RESULTS: Aclidinium-formoterol 400/12 microg provided marginally higher costs ( pound41) and more QALYs (0.014), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound2,976/QALY. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust to key parameter variations, and the main drivers were: mean baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), risk of exacerbation, FEV1 improvement from aclidinium-formoterol 400/12 microg, and lung-function decline. The probability of aclidinium-formoterol 400/12 microg being cost-effective (using a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000/QALY) versus aclidinium 400 microg was 79%. CONCLUSION: In Scotland, aclidinium-formoterol 400/12 microg can be considered a cost-effective treatment option compared to aclidinium 400 microg alone in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD.",2016-01-22051,27672337,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Mafalda Ramos,2016,8 /,445-56,No,27672337,"Mafalda Ramos; John Haughney; Nathaniel Henry; Leandro Lindner; Mark Lamotte; Cost versus utility of aclidinium bromide 400 microg plus formoterol fumarate dihydrate 12 microg compared to aclidinium bromide 400 microg alone in the management of moderate-to-severe COPD, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2016; 8():1178-6981; 445-56",QALY,Scotland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Aclidinium-formoterol 400/12 µg vs. Standard/Usual Care- Aclidinium 400 µg alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,2976,United Kingdom,2014,5363.19
16204,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV-1 prevention in the Netherlands: a mathematical modelling study,"BACKGROUND: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with tenofovir and emtricitabine prevents HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM). PrEP can be given on a daily or intermittent basis. Unfortunately, PrEP is not reimbursed in most European countries. Cost-effectiveness analyses of PrEP among MSM in Europe are absent but are key for decision makers to decide upon PrEP implementation. METHODS: We developed a deterministic mathematical model, calibrated to the well defined Dutch HIV epidemic among MSM, to predict the effect and cost-effectiveness of PrEP. PrEP was targeted to 10% of highly sexually active Dutch MSM over the coming 40 years. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to predict the cost-effectiveness of daily and on-demand PrEP. Cost-effectiveness ratios below euro20 000 were considered to be cost-effective in this analysis. FINDINGS: Within the context of a stable HIV epidemic, at 80% effectiveness and current PrEP pricing, PrEP can cost as much as euro11 000 (IQR 9400-14 100) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained when used daily, or as little as euro2000 (IQR 1300-3000) per QALY gained when used on demand. At 80% effectiveness, daily PrEP can be considered cost-saving if the price of PrEP is reduced by 70%, and on-demand PrEP can be considered cost-saving if the price is reduced by 30-40%. INTERPRETATION: PrEP for HIV prevention among MSM in the Netherlands is cost-effective. The use of PrEP is most cost-effective when the price of PrEP is reduced through on-demand use or through availability of generic PrEP, and can quickly be considered cost-saving.

16210,Optimizing HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis implementation among men who have sex with men in a large urban centre: a dynamic modelling study,"INTRODUCTION: Once-daily tenofovir/emtricitabine-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can reduce HIV acquisition in men who have sex with men (MSM), by 44% in the iPrEx trial, and reaching up to 99% with high adherence. We examined the potential population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of different PrEP implementation strategies. METHODS: We developed a dynamic, stochastic compartmental model of HIV transmission among the estimated 57,400 MSM in Toronto, Canada. Parameterization was performed using local epidemiologic data. Strategies examined included (1) uniform PrEP delivery versus targeting the highest risk decile of MSM (with varying coverage proportions); (2) increasing PrEP efficacy as a surrogate of adherence (44% to 99%); and (3) varying HIV test frequency (once monthly to once yearly). Outcomes included HIV infections averted and the incremental cost ($CAD) per incremental quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained over 20 years. RESULTS: Use of PrEP among all HIV-uninfected MSM at 25, 50, 75 and 100% coverage prevented 1970, 3427, 4317, and 4581 infections, respectively, with cost/QALY increasing from $500,000 to $800,000 CAD. Targeted PrEP for the highest risk MSM at 25, 50, 75 and 100% coverage prevented 1166, 2154, 2816, and 3012 infections, respectively, with cost/QALY ranging from $35,000 to $70,000 CAD. Maximizing PrEP efficacy, in a scenario of 25% coverage of high-risk MSM with PrEP, prevented 1540 infections with a cost/QALY of $15,000 CAD. HIV testing alone (Q3 months) averted 898 of infections with a cost savings of $4,000 CAD per QALY.

We examined the potential population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of different PrEP implementation strategies. METHODS: We developed a dynamic, stochastic compartmental model of HIV transmission among the estimated 57,400 MSM in Toronto, Canada. Parameterization was performed using local epidemiologic data. Strategies examined included (1) uniform PrEP delivery versus targeting the highest risk decile of MSM (with varying coverage proportions); (2) increasing PrEP efficacy as a surrogate of adherence (44% to 99%); and (3) varying HIV test frequency (once monthly to once yearly). Outcomes included HIV infections averted and the incremental cost ($CAD) per incremental quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained over 20 years. RESULTS: Use of PrEP among all HIV-uninfected MSM at 25, 50, 75 and 100% coverage prevented 1970, 3427, 4317, and 4581 infections, respectively, with cost/QALY increasing from $500,000 to $800,000 CAD. Targeted PrEP for the highest risk MSM at 25, 50, 75 and 100% coverage prevented 1166, 2154, 2816, and 3012 infections, respectively, with cost/QALY ranging from $35,000 to $70,000 CAD. Maximizing PrEP efficacy, in a scenario of 25% coverage of high-risk MSM with PrEP, prevented 1540 infections with a cost/QALY of $15,000 CAD.

We examined the potential population-level impact and cost-effectiveness of different PrEP implementation strategies. METHODS: We developed a dynamic, stochastic compartmental model of HIV transmission among the estimated 57,400 MSM in Toronto, Canada. Parameterization was performed using local epidemiologic data. Strategies examined included (1) uniform PrEP delivery versus targeting the highest risk decile of MSM (with varying coverage proportions); (2) increasing PrEP efficacy as a surrogate of adherence (44% to 99%); and (3) varying HIV test frequency (once monthly to once yearly). Outcomes included HIV infections averted and the incremental cost ($CAD) per incremental quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained over 20 years. RESULTS: Use of PrEP among all HIV-uninfected MSM at 25, 50, 75 and 100% coverage prevented 1970, 3427, 4317, and 4581 infections, respectively, with cost/QALY increasing from $500,000 to $800,000 CAD.

16228,Determining Cost-Effectiveness of Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty Using the Short Form-6D Utility Measure,"BACKGROUND: With the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, cost-effectiveness analyses are becoming increasingly important for resource allocation, and particularly for the justification of costly procedures, such as total knee and total hip arthroplasties (TKAs and THAs). Therefore, using the Short Form-6D (SF-6D) utility values, the purpose of this study was to determine (1) the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and (2) and the cost-effectiveness of undergoing THA and TKA. METHODS: A total of 844 patients (357 men, 487 women) who had a mean age of 65 years (range, 39 to 80 years) underwent primary TKA, and 224 patients who had a mean age of 69 years (range, 44 to 88 years) underwent primary THAs at 7 institutions. The SF-6D values were derived for each patient preoperatively and at 1-year follow-up. QALYs were estimated at 1 year, and lifetime QALYs gained were determined using predicted life-expectancy values, at a discounted rate of 3% per year of life expectancy, to reflect a diminishing gain with time. National-level costs were determined using the 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were deduced for both groups. RESULTS: The preoperative SF-6D values for the THA and TKA cohorts were 0.614 (range, 0.37 to 1) and 0.62 (range, 0.3 to 0.93). Postoperatively, SF-6D values improved significantly at 1 year in both groups. One-year QALYs for TKA and THA were 0.768 and 0.799. Lifetime QALYs gained for the groups were 2.07 and 1.85 (1.39 and 1.34 if discounted at a rate of 3% per year). The estimated ICER for TKA vs baseline presurgery was $43,107 per QALY, and $39,453 per QALY for THA vs baseline presurgery. CONCLUSION: The ICER showed that THA and TKA are cost-effective, compared to the $50,000 USD/QALY threshold for cost-effectiveness, and justify resources allocated to these surgeries.

16230,Pulmonary artery pressure-guided heart failure management: US cost-effectiveness analyses using the results of the CHAMPION clinical trial,"AIMS: Haemodynamic-guided heart failure (HF) management effectively reduces decompensation events and need for hospitalizations. The economic benefit of clinical improvement requires further study. METHODS AND RESULTS: An estimate of the cost-effectiveness of haemodynamic-guided HF management was made based on observations published in the randomized, prospective single-blinded CHAMPION trial. A comprehensive analysis was performed including healthcare utilization event rates, survival, and quality of life demonstrated in the randomized portion of the trial (18 months). Markov modelling with Monte Carlo simulation was used to approximate comprehensive costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from a payer perspective. Unit costs were estimated using the Truven Health MarketScan database from April 2008 to March 2013. Over a 5-year horizon, patients in the Treatment group had average QALYs of 2.56 with a total cost of US$56 974; patients in the Control group had QALYs of 2.16 with a total cost of US$52 149. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$12 262 per QALY. Using comprehensive cost modelling, including all anticipated costs of HF and non-HF hospitalizations, physician visits, prescription drugs, long-term care, and outpatient hospital visits over 5 years, the Treatment group had a total cost of US$212 004 and the Control group had a total cost of US$200 360. The ICER was US$29 593 per QALY.

16231,Optimal timing for hepatitis C therapy in US patients eligible for liver transplantation: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) following liver transplantation (LT) is universal for those with ongoing viraemia and is associated with higher rates of allograft failure and death. However, the optimal timing of HCV treatment for patients awaiting transplant remains unclear. AIM: To evaluate the comparative cost-effectiveness of treating HCV pre-LT vs. post-LT (pre-emptive or after HCV recurrence). METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was created to simulate the progression of a cohort of HCV-genotype 1 or 4 cirrhotic patients from the time of transplant listing until death. We then used this model to study the cost-effectiveness of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) with ribavirin for 12 weeks, administered for three separate treatment strategies: (i) pre-LT; (ii) post-LT preemptively prior to HCV recurrence; or (iii) post-LT after HCV recurrence. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis using a median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score <25 at the time of transplant, we found that pre-LT treatment of HCV led to more QALYs for fewer dollars compared to other strategies. Analysis limited to living donor LT recipients revealed that pre-LT treatment was also the most cost-effective strategy. When the analysis was repeated for MELD >/=25, decompensated disease (Child-Pugh class B or C), and hepatocellular carcinoma cases, preemptive post-LT strategy was more cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of HCV prior to liver transplantation appears to be the most cost-effective strategy for patients with a MELD score <25.

16232,Optimal timing for hepatitis C therapy in US patients eligible for liver transplantation: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) following liver transplantation (LT) is universal for those with ongoing viraemia and is associated with higher rates of allograft failure and death. However, the optimal timing of HCV treatment for patients awaiting transplant remains unclear. AIM: To evaluate the comparative cost-effectiveness of treating HCV pre-LT vs. post-LT (pre-emptive or after HCV recurrence). METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was created to simulate the progression of a cohort of HCV-genotype 1 or 4 cirrhotic patients from the time of transplant listing until death. We then used this model to study the cost-effectiveness of ledipasvir-sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) with ribavirin for 12 weeks, administered for three separate treatment strategies: (i) pre-LT; (ii) post-LT preemptively prior to HCV recurrence; or (iii) post-LT after HCV recurrence. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis using a median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score <25 at the time of transplant, we found that pre-LT treatment of HCV led to more QALYs for fewer dollars compared to other strategies. Analysis limited to living donor LT recipients revealed that pre-LT treatment was also the most cost-effective strategy. When the analysis was repeated for MELD >/=25, decompensated disease (Child-Pugh class B or C), and hepatocellular carcinoma cases, preemptive post-LT strategy was more cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of HCV prior to liver transplantation appears to be the most cost-effective strategy for patients with a MELD score <25.

16237,The cost-effectiveness of TheraBite(R) as treatment for acute myogenic temporomandibular disorder,"OBJECTIVE: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a very common and costly pain problem concerning the temporomandibular joint. A previous study has shown that for the treatment of acute myogenic TMD, TheraBite(R) (TB) offers a faster and greater effect than usual care consisting of physical therapy (PT). This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of TB compared to PT. METHODS: Differences in costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between TB and PT are analyzed using a decision model. RESULTS: The point estimate for the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is -28,068 EUR (-30,191 USD) per QALY (dominant) for TB versus PT. At the willingness-to-pay ratio of 20,000 EUR (21,513 USD) per QALY, TB has a 97% probability of being cost-effective compared to PT.

Objective: To compare total and AAA-related use of health care services, costs, and cost-effectiveness between groups randomized to open or endovascular repair. Design, Setting, and Participants: This unblinded randomized clinical trial enrolled 881 patients undergoing planned elective repair of AAA who were candidates for open and endovascular repair procedures. Patients were randomized from October 15, 2002, to April 15, 2008, at 42 Veterans Affairs medical centers. Follow-up was completed on October 15, 2011, and data were analyzed from April 15, 2013, to April 15, 2016, based on intention to treat. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean total and AAA-related health care cost per life-year and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results: A total of 881 patients (876 men [99.4%]; 5 women [0.6%]; mean [SD] age, 70 [7.8] years) were included in the analysis. After a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, mean life-years were 4.89 in the endovascular group and 4.84 in the open repair group (P = .68), and mean QALYs were 3.72 in the endovascular group and 3.70 in the open repair group (P = .82). Total mean health care costs did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (endovascular group, $142745; open repair group, $153533; difference, -$10788; 95% CI, -$29796 to $5825; P = .25). Costs related to AAA, including the initial repair, constituted nearly 40% of total costs and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (endovascular group, $57501; open repair group, $57893; difference, -$393; 95% CI, -$12071 to $7928; P = .94). Lower costs due to shorter hospitalization for initial endovascular repair were offset by increased costs from AAA-related secondary procedures and imaging studies. The probability of endovascular repair being less costly and more effective was 56.8% when effectiveness was measured in life-years and 55.4% when effectiveness was measured in QALYs for total costs and 31.3% and 34.3%, respectively, for AAA-related costs. Conclusions and Relevance: In this multicenter randomized clinical trial with follow-up to 9 years, survival, quality of life, costs, and cost-effectiveness did not differ between elective open and endovascular repair of AAA.

16239,Cost-effectiveness of Intensive Blood Pressure Management,"Importance: Among high-risk patients with hypertension, targeting a systolic blood pressure of 120 mm Hg reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality compared with a higher target. However, intensive blood pressure management incurs additional costs from treatment and from adverse events. Objective: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of intensive blood pressure management compared with standard management. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cost-effectiveness analysis conducted from September 2015 to August 2016 used a Markov cohort model to estimate cost-effectiveness of intensive blood pressure management among 68-year-old high-risk adults with hypertension but not diabetes. We used the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) to estimate treatment effects and adverse event rates. We used Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Life Tables to project age- and cause-specific mortality, calibrated to rates reported in SPRINT. We also used population-based observational data to model development of heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and subsequent mortality. Costs were based on published sources, Medicare data, and the National Inpatient Sample. Interventions: Treatment of hypertension to a systolic blood pressure goal of 120 mm Hg (intensive management) or 140 mm Hg (standard management). Main Outcomes and Measures: Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), discounted at 3% annually. Results: Standard management yielded 9.6 QALYs and accrued $155261 in lifetime costs, while intensive management yielded 10.5 QALYs and accrued $176584 in costs. Intensive blood pressure management cost $23777 per QALY gained. In a sensitivity analysis, serious adverse events would need to occur at 3 times the rate observed in SPRINT and be 3 times more common in the intensive management arm to prefer standard management. Conclusions and Relevance: Intensive blood pressure management is cost-effective at typical thresholds for value in health care and remains so even with substantially higher adverse event rates.",2016-01-22144,27627731,JAMA Cardiol,Ilana B Richman,2016,1 / 8,872-879,No,27627731,"Ilana B Richman; Michael Fairley; Mads Emil Jorgensen; Alejandro Schuler; Douglas K Owens; Jeremy D Goldhaber-Fiebert; Cost-effectiveness of Intensive Blood Pressure Management, JAMA Cardiol, 2016 Nov 01; 1(8):2380-6591; 872-879",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensive Blood Pressure Management vs. Standard/Usual Care- Sstandard management,Among 68-year-old high-risk adults with hypertension but not diabetes,68 Years,68 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,23777,United States,2016,25639.87
16240,Cost-effectiveness analysis of quadrivalent versus trivalent influenza vaccine in Taiwan: A lifetime multi-cohort model,"A government-funded trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) program to prevent seasonal influenza was implemented in Taiwan since 1998. However, mismatch between the vaccine and circulating strains may occur. Alternatively, a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) includes all 4 influenza lineages could minimize the risk of mismatches. Therefore, QIV could be considered as an alternative strategy to enhance protection against seasonal influenza. The objective of the study was to analyze, from a governmental perspective, the cost-effectiveness of using QIV vs. TIV as a vaccination strategy in Taiwan. A lifetime multi-cohort, static Markov model was constructed with 9 age groups to assess the costs and effectiveness of QIV vs. TIV. Direct costs were obtained from a database released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Outcomes included life-years gained, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, influenza cases avoided and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The discount rate of costs and effectiveness was set at 3.5% and the time horizon used in the model was 100 y. Results show that a vaccination strategy utilizing QIV instead of TIV would bring an additional 10,557 QALYs at an extra cost of US$39.4 million, yielding an ICER of US$3,015.07 per QALY gained. When setting the willingness-to-pay threshold at US$10,000, compared to TIV, the probability that QIV would be cost-effective was 98%. Sensitivity analyses show that ICER was sensitive to the changes of circulation of influenza virus subtypes and vaccine mismatch.

Its main complication is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), pain persisting or occurring after the rash onset. HZ treatment aims to reduce acute pain, impede the onset complications, and disease progression. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination compared with no vaccination strategy, within the Italian context. METHODS: The natural history of HZ and PHN was mapped through a Markov model with lifetime horizon. A population of patients aged between 60 and 79 years was hypothesized. Third party payer (Italian National Health Service, I-NHS) and societal perspectives were adopted. Data were derived from literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the vaccination equaled EUR 11,943 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) under the I-NHS perspective and EUR 11,248 per QALY under the societal perspective.

16242,The cost-effectiveness of bike lanes in New York City,"BACKGROUND: Our objective is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of investments in bike lanes using New York City''s (NYC) fiscal year 2015 investment as a case study. We also provide a generalizable model, so that localities can estimate their return on bike lane investments. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bike lane construction using a two-stage model. Our regression analysis, to estimate the marginal addition of lane miles on the expansion in bike ridership, reveals that the 45.5 miles of bike lanes NYC constructed in 2015 at a cost of $8 109 511.47 may increase the probability of riding bikes by 9.32%. In the second stage, we constructed a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of bike lane construction. This model compares the status quo with the 2015 investment. We consider the reduced risk of injury and increased probability of ridership, costs associated with bike lane implementation and maintenance, and effectiveness due to physical activity and reduced pollution. We use Monte Carlo simulation and one-way sensitivity analysis to test the reliability of the base-case result. This model reveals that over the lifetime of all people in NYC, bike lane construction produces additional costs of $2.79 and gain of 0.0022 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per person. This results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1297/QALY gained (95% CI -$544/QALY gained to $5038/QALY gained).

16243,Suture Button Fixation Versus Syndesmotic Screws in Supination-External Rotation Type 4 Injuries,"BACKGROUND: In stress-positive, unstable supination-external rotation type 4 (SER IV) ankle fractures, implant selection for syndesmotic fixation is a debated topic. Among the available syndesmotic fixation methods, the metallic screw and the suture button have been routinely compared in the literature. In addition to strength of fixation and ability to anatomically restore the syndesmosis, costs associated with implant use have recently been called into question. PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of the suture button and determine whether suture button fixation is more cost-effective than two 3.5-mm syndesmotic screws not removed on a routine postoperative basis. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: Studies with the highest evidence levels in the available literature were used to estimate the hardware removal and failure rates for syndesmotic screws and suture button fixation. Costs were determined by examining the average costs for patients who underwent surgery for unstable SER IV ankle fractures at a single level-1 trauma institution. A decision analysis model that allowed comparison of the 2 fixation methods was developed. RESULTS: Using a 20% screw hardware removal rate and a 4% suture button hardware removal rate, the total cost for 2 syndesmotic screws was US$20,836 and the total effectiveness was 5.846. This yielded a total cost of $3564 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) over an 8-year time period. The total cost for suture button fixation was $19,354 and the total effectiveness was 5.904, resulting in a total cost of $3294 per QALY over the same time period. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted to assess suture button fixation costs as well as screw and suture button hardware removal rates. Other possible treatment scenarios were also examined, including 1 screw and 2 suture buttons for operative fixation of the syndesmosis. To become more cost-effective, the screw hardware removal rate would have to be reduced to less than 10%. Furthermore, fixation with a single suture button continued to be the dominant treatment strategy compared with 2 suture buttons, 1 screw, and 2 screws for syndesmotic fixation. CONCLUSION: This cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that for unstable SER IV ankle fractures, suture button fixation is more cost-effective than syndesmotic screws not removed on a routine basis. Suture button fixation was a dominant treatment strategy, because patients spent on average $1482 less and had a higher quality of life by 0.058 QALYs compared with patients who received fixation with 2 syndesmotic screws. Assuming that functional outcomes and failure rates were equivalent, screw fixation only became more cost-effective when the screw hardware removal rate was reduced to less than 10% or when the suture button cost exceeded $2000. In addition, fixation with a single suture button device proved more cost-effective than fixation with either 1 or 2 syndesmotic screws.",2016-01-22196,27601151,Am J Sports Med,Kaitlin C Neary,2017,45 / 1,,No,27601151,"Kaitlin C Neary; Matthew A Mormino; Hongmei Wang; Suture Button Fixation Versus Syndesmotic Screws in Supination-External Rotation Type 4 Injuries, Am J Sports Med, 2017 Jan; 45(1):1552-3365",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,TightRope (Arthrex) suture button fixation vs. 2 syndesmotic screws,"stress-positive, unstable supination–external rotation type 4 (SER IV) ankle fractures",Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,8 Years,3.00,Not Stated,-25551.72,United States,2014,-27934.35
16244,Clinical and economic benefits of integrated pump/CGM technology therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes in Colombia,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term clinical and economic impact of integrated pump/CGM technology therapy as compared to multiple daily injections (MDI), for the treatment of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in Colombia. METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model was used to simulate a hypothetical cohort of patients with T1D. Mean baseline characteristics were taken from a clinical study conducted in Colombia and a healthcare payer perspective was adopted, with a 5% annual discount rate applied to both costs and outcomes. RESULTS: The integrated pump/CGM improved mean life expectancy by 3.51 years compared with MDI. A similar increase occurred in mean quality-adjusted life expectancy with an additional 3.81 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Onset of diabetes-related complications was also delayed as compared to MDI, and mean survival time free of complication increased by 1.74 years with integrated pump/CGM. Although this increased treatment costs of diabetes as compared to MDI, savings were achieved thanks to reduced expenditure on diabetes-related complications. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for SAP was Colombian Pesos (COP) 44,893,950 (approximately USD$23,200) per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Improved blood glucose control associated to integrated pump/CGM results in a decreased incidence of diabetes-related complications and improves life expectancy as compared to MDI. Using recommended thresholds from the World Health Organization and previous coverage decisions about health technologies in Colombia, it is a cost-effective alternative to MDI for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in Colombia.",2016-01-22205,27595241,Endocrinol Nutr,Ana Maria Gomez,2016,63 / 9,466-474,No,27595241,"Ana Maria Gomez; Rafael Alfonso-Cristancho; John Jairo Orozco; Peter Matthew Lynch; Diana Prieto; Rhodri Saunders; Stephane Roze; Juan Esteban Valencia; Clinical and economic benefits of integrated pump/CGM technology therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes in Colombia, Endocrinol Nutr, 2016 Nov; 63(9):1579-2021; 466-474",QALY,Colombia,Not Stated,Not Stated,integrated pump/continuous glucose monitoring technology vs. multiple dose insulin injections,type 1 diabetes,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,43795.22,Colombia,2013,26.81
16245,Cost-utility analysis of competing treatment strategies for drug-resistant epilepsy in children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,"BACKGROUND: The management of drug-resistant epilepsy in children with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is challenging because of the multitude of treatment options, wide range of associated costs, and uncertainty of seizure outcomes. The most cost-effective approach for children whose epilepsy has failed to improve with first-line medical therapy is uncertain. METHODS: A review of MEDLINE from 1990 to 2015 was conducted. A cost-utility analysis, from a third-party payer perspective, was performed for children with drug-resistant epilepsy that had failed to improve with 2 antiseizure drugs (ASDs) and that was amenable to resective epilepsy surgery, across a time-horizon of 5years. Four strategies were included: (1) resective epilepsy surgery, (2) vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) implantation, (3) ketogenic diet, and (4) addition of a third ASD (specifically, carbamazepine). The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was analyzed. RESULTS: Given a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $100,000 per QALY, the addition of a third ASD ($6600 for a gain of 4.14 QALYs) was the most cost-effective treatment strategy. In a secondary analysis, if the child whose epilepsy had failed to improve with 3 ASDs, ketogenic diet, addition of a fourth ASD, and resective epilepsy surgery were incrementally cost-effective treatment strategies. Vagus nerve stimulator implantation was more expensive yet less effective than alternative strategies and should not be prioritized.

16248,Cost-effectiveness of apixaban and warfarin in the prevention of thromboembolic complications among atrial fibrillation patients,"BACKGROUND: To reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications, clinical guidelines recommend anticoagulation treatment for almost all atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Although warfarin has long been the primary treatment alternative, now newer alternatives such as apixaban have proven effective in prevention of the thromboembolic complications of non-valvular AF. The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of apixaban when compared with warfarin in the prevention of AF-associated thromboembolic complications in Finland. METHODS: The assessment was performed with a lifetime Markov-model with the following health states: non-valvular AF, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, other intracranial bleed, other major bleed, clinically relevant non-major bleed, myocardial infarction, and systemic embolism. The treatment efficacies were obtained from the ARISTOTLE trial. Representative Finnish input data were used for the model states, including background mortality, resource use, costs (in 2014 values), and EQ-5D-3L-based quality of life. The results (with 3 % annual discounting) are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICER, cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained], the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), and the probability of apixaban being cost-effective at various willingness-to-pay levels. RESULTS: Apixaban increased life-expectancy by 0.17 years and quality-adjusted life-expectancy by 0.14 QALYs when compared with warfarin. Additional QALY was gained with apixaban at a cost of 1824 euros based on the deterministic analysis. The maximum EVPI was 649 euros/patient at 1282 euros per QALY gained in the probabilistic analysis. The probability of apixaban being cost-effective reached 80 % when the willingness-to-pay per QALY gained was 14,857 euros. In deterministic sensitivity analyses, ICERs varied from dominance of apixaban to additional QALY being gained at a cost of 12,312 euros. CONCLUSIONS: The ICERs obtained were well below the WHO-CHOICE threshold values for cost-effective interventions, suggesting that apixaban is a very cost-effective treatment alternative for warfarin in Finnish patients with AF.",2016-01-22217,27588247,Springerplus,Taru Hallinen,2016,5 / 1,1354,No,27588247,"Taru Hallinen; Erkki J Soini; Miika Linna; Samuli I Saarni; Cost-effectiveness of apixaban and warfarin in the prevention of thromboembolic complications among atrial fibrillation patients, Springerplus, 2016; 5(1):2193-1801; 1354",QALY,Finland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixiban vs. Standard/Usual Care- Warfarin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1824,Euro,2014,2651.47
16249,Cost-effectiveness analysis of left atrial appendage occlusion compared with pharmacological strategies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is a promising therapy for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) but its cost-effectiveness remains understudied. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of LAAO for stroke prophylaxis in NVAF. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of LAAO with 7 pharmacological strategies: aspirin alone, clopidogrel plus aspirin, warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban, and rivaroxaban. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Base-case data were derived from ACTIVE, RE-LY, ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, PROTECT-AF and PREVAIL trials. One-way sensitivity analysis varied by CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons, and LAAO costs; and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations was conducted to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: LAAO was considered cost-effective compared with aspirin, clopidogrel plus aspirin, and warfarin, with ICER of US$5,115, $2,447, and $6,298 per QALY gained, respectively. LAAO was dominant (i.e. less costly but more effective) compared to other strategies. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated favorable ICERs of LAAO against other strategies in varied CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons (5 to 15 years) and LAAO costs. LAAO was cost-effective in 86.24 % of 10,000 simulations using a threshold of US$50,000/QALY.

This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of LAAO for stroke prophylaxis in NVAF. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of LAAO with 7 pharmacological strategies: aspirin alone, clopidogrel plus aspirin, warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban, and rivaroxaban. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Base-case data were derived from ACTIVE, RE-LY, ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, PROTECT-AF and PREVAIL trials. One-way sensitivity analysis varied by CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons, and LAAO costs; and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations was conducted to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: LAAO was considered cost-effective compared with aspirin, clopidogrel plus aspirin, and warfarin, with ICER of US$5,115, $2,447, and $6,298 per QALY gained, respectively. LAAO was dominant (i.e. less costly but more effective) compared to other strategies. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated favorable ICERs of LAAO against other strategies in varied CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons (5 to 15 years) and LAAO costs. LAAO was cost-effective in 86.24 % of 10,000 simulations using a threshold of US$50,000/QALY.

This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of LAAO for stroke prophylaxis in NVAF. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of LAAO with 7 pharmacological strategies: aspirin alone, clopidogrel plus aspirin, warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban, and rivaroxaban. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Base-case data were derived from ACTIVE, RE-LY, ARISTOTLE, ROCKET-AF, PROTECT-AF and PREVAIL trials. One-way sensitivity analysis varied by CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons, and LAAO costs; and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations was conducted to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: LAAO was considered cost-effective compared with aspirin, clopidogrel plus aspirin, and warfarin, with ICER of US$5,115, $2,447, and $6,298 per QALY gained, respectively. LAAO was dominant (i.e. less costly but more effective) compared to other strategies.

This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of LAAO for stroke prophylaxis in NVAF. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of LAAO with 7 pharmacological strategies: aspirin alone, clopidogrel plus aspirin, warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban, and rivaroxaban. Outcome measures included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).

One-way sensitivity analysis varied by CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons, and LAAO costs; and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations was conducted to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: LAAO was considered cost-effective compared with aspirin, clopidogrel plus aspirin, and warfarin, with ICER of US$5,115, $2,447, and $6,298 per QALY gained, respectively.

Sensitivity analysis demonstrated favorable ICERs of LAAO against other strategies in varied CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons (5 to 15 years) and LAAO costs. LAAO was cost-effective in 86.24 % of 10,000 simulations using a threshold of US$50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter LAAO is cost-effective for prevention of stroke in NVAF compared with 7 pharmacological strategies.

RESULTS: LAAO was considered cost-effective compared with aspirin, clopidogrel plus aspirin, and warfarin, with ICER of US$5,115, $2,447, and $6,298 per QALY gained, respectively. LAAO was dominant (i.e. less costly but more effective) compared to other strategies. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated favorable ICERs of LAAO against other strategies in varied CHADS2 score, HAS-BLED score, time horizons (5 to 15 years) and LAAO costs. LAAO was cost-effective in 86.24 % of 10,000 simulations using a threshold of US$50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Transcatheter LAAO is cost-effective for prevention of stroke in NVAF compared with 7 pharmacological strategies. The transcatheter left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) is considered cost-effective against the standard 7 oral pharmacological strategies including acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone, clopidogrel plus ASA, warfarin, dabigatran 110 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, apixaban, and rivaroxaban for stroke prophylaxis in non-valvular atrial fibrillation management.",2016-01-22231,27581874,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,Vivian Wing-Yan Lee,2016,16 / 1,167,No,27581874,"Vivian Wing-Yan Lee; Ronald Bing-Ching Tsai; Ines Hang-Iao Chow; Bryan Ping-Yen Yan; Mehmet Gungor Kaya; Jai-Wun Park; Yat-Yin Lam; Cost-effectiveness analysis of left atrial appendage occlusion compared with pharmacological strategies for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, BMC Cardiovasc Disord, 2016; 16(1):1471-2261; 167",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dabigatran 150 mg vs. Standard/Usual Care- Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) Occlusion,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 5 Years, 10 Years, 15 Years",3.00,3.00,56034,United States,2014,61259.02
