20801,Cost-effectiveness of screening for HLA-B*1502 prior to initiation of carbamazepine in epilepsy patients of Asian ancestry in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: Carbamazepine, widely used in the treatment of partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, has been associated with life-threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis among some Asians. The HLA-B*1502 genotype that occurs with varying frequency among Asians is recommended for screening prior to starting carbamazepine. Our goal is to explore the cost-effectiveness of screening for the presence of this genetic allele. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model in a hypothetical cohort of adult Asian patients with epilepsy in the United States being considered for carbamazepine to investigate the cost-effectiveness of two alternative strategies: (1) no HLA-B*1502 gene allele screening and using carbamazepine and (2) HLA-B*1502 gene allele screening and starting levetiracetam in the case of a positive screen. RESULTS: For the lifetime horizon, HLA-B*1502 gene screening was the cost-effective choice compared to no gene screening, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $27 058 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), below the $50 000/QALY threshold in 99.69% of probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Although gene screening strategy was more expensive than a no screening strategy, it was more effective, yielding more QALYs, across all Asian ethnic groups.

20806,Cost Effectiveness of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy in Multiply Relapsed or Refractory Adult Large B-Cell Lymphoma,"PURPOSE: Two anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies are approved for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel; each costs $373,000. We evaluated their cost effectiveness. METHODS: We used a decision analytic Markov model informed by recent multicenter, single-arm trials to evaluate axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in multiply relapsed/refractory, adult, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness assumptions, each therapy was compared with salvage chemoimmunotherapy regimens and stem-cell transplantation. Main outcomes were undiscounted life years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3% annual discount rate). Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty. RESULTS: In an optimistic scenario, assuming a 40% 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), axi-cel increased life expectancy by 8.2 years at $129,000/QALY gained (95% uncertainty interval, $90,000 to $219,000). At a 30% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were more modest (6.4 years) and expensive ($159,000/QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, $105,000 to $284,000]). In an optimistic scenario, assuming a 35% 5-year PFS, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancy by 4.6 years at $168,000/QALY gained (95% uncertainty interval, $105,000 to $414,000/QALY). At a 25% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were smaller (3.4 years) and more expensive ($223,000/QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, $123,000 to $1,170,000/QALY]). Administering CAR-T to all indicated patients would increase US health care costs by approximately $10 billion over 5 years. Price reductions to $250,000 and $200,000, respectively, or payment only for initial complete response (at current prices) would allow axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel to cost less than $150,000/QALY, even at 25% PFS. CONCLUSION: At 2018 prices, it is possible that both CAR-T therapies meet a less than $150,000/QALY threshold. This depends on long-term outcomes compared with chemoimmunotherapy and stem-cell transplantation, which are uncertain.

20811,Cost Effectiveness of Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-Cell Therapy in Multiply Relapsed or Refractory Adult Large B-Cell Lymphoma,"PURPOSE: Two anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies are approved for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel; each costs $373,000. We evaluated their cost effectiveness. METHODS: We used a decision analytic Markov model informed by recent multicenter, single-arm trials to evaluate axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in multiply relapsed/refractory, adult, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness assumptions, each therapy was compared with salvage chemoimmunotherapy regimens and stem-cell transplantation. Main outcomes were undiscounted life years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3% annual discount rate). Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty. RESULTS: In an optimistic scenario, assuming a 40% 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), axi-cel increased life expectancy by 8.2 years at $129,000/QALY gained (95% uncertainty interval, $90,000 to $219,000). At a 30% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were more modest (6.4 years) and expensive ($159,000/QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, $105,000 to $284,000]). In an optimistic scenario, assuming a 35% 5-year PFS, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancy by 4.6 years at $168,000/QALY gained (95% uncertainty interval, $105,000 to $414,000/QALY). At a 25% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were smaller (3.4 years) and more expensive ($223,000/QALY gained [95% uncertainty interval, $123,000 to $1,170,000/QALY]). Administering CAR-T to all indicated patients would increase US health care costs by approximately $10 billion over 5 years. Price reductions to $250,000 and $200,000, respectively, or payment only for initial complete response (at current prices) would allow axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel to cost less than $150,000/QALY, even at 25% PFS. CONCLUSION: At 2018 prices, it is possible that both CAR-T therapies meet a less than $150,000/QALY threshold. This depends on long-term outcomes compared with chemoimmunotherapy and stem-cell transplantation, which are uncertain. Widespread adoption would substantially increase non-Hodgkin lymphoma health care costs.

METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling to evaluate the efficiency of the immunisation programmes from payer''s perspective. Eight strategies with different ages to receive VVL or RZV were set, namely: 65-84year old (y.o.), 70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o., and 80-84 y.o. VVL- or RZV-strategy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with curative care scenario were calculated. The health statuses following the target cohort were as follows: acute HZ followed by recovery, post-herpetic neuralgia followed by recovery, post HZ/PHN, recurrence of HZ, and general death. RESULTS: At the vaccination cost yen8000 (US$73) for 1-dose ZVL and yen30,000 (US$273) for 2-dose RZV, ICERs ranged from yen2,633,587/US$23,942 (age 80-84 y.o.) to yen3,434,267 or US$31,221 (age 65-84 y.o.)/QALY gained for VVL-strategies; from yen5,262,227 or US$47,838 (age 80-84 y.o.) to yen6,278,557 or US$57,078/QALY gained (age 65-84 y.o.) for RZV-strategies.

20826,Cost-effectiveness of Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV) and Varicella Vaccine Live (VVL) against herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia among adults aged 65 and over in Japan,"BACKGROUND: The approval of the extended use of 1-dose varicella vaccine (VVL) in adults aged 50 and older against herpes zoster (HZ) in 2016 and the 2-dose recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) in 2018 raised the need to evaluate the value for money between these two vaccines. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling to evaluate the efficiency of the immunisation programmes from payer''s perspective. Eight strategies with different ages to receive VVL or RZV were set, namely: 65-84year old (y.o.), 70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o., and 80-84 y.o. VVL- or RZV-strategy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with curative care scenario were calculated. The health statuses following the target cohort were as follows: acute HZ followed by recovery, post-herpetic neuralgia followed by recovery, post HZ/PHN, recurrence of HZ, and general death. RESULTS: At the vaccination cost yen8000 (US$73) for 1-dose ZVL and yen30,000 (US$273) for 2-dose RZV, ICERs ranged from yen2,633,587/US$23,942 (age 80-84 y.o.) to yen3,434,267 or US$31,221 (age 65-84 y.o.)/QALY gained for VVL-strategies; from yen5,262,227 or US$47,838 (age 80-84 y.o.) to yen6,278,557 or US$57,078/QALY gained (age 65-84 y.o.) for RZV-strategies. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves derived from probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that if the cost-effective threshold was at yen3,000,000 or US$27,273/QALY, the acceptability was 90.7% and 8.8% for 65-84 VVL-strategy and 65-84 RZV-strategy, respectively; if at yen5,000,000 or US$45,455/QALY, 56.2% and 43.8%, and if at yen10,000,000 or US$90,909/QALY 11.9% and 88.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Vaccinating individuals aged 65-84 y.o., 70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o., 80-84 y.o. with VVL or RZV to prevent HZ-associated disease in Japan can be cost-effective from payer''s perspective, with vaccination costs at yen8,000 per shot for VVL, yen30,000 for 2-dose RZV.

20827,Milk Powder Fortified with Potassium and Phytosterols to Decrease the Risk of Cardiovascular Events among the Adult Population in Malaysia: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the consumption of a milk powder product fortified with potassium (+1050.28 mg/day) and phytosterols (+1200 mg/day) to lower systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, respectively, and, therefore, the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke among the 35-75-year-old population in Malaysia. A Markov model was created against a do-nothing option, from a governmental perspective, and with a time horizon of 40 years. Different data sources, encompassing clinical studies, practice guidelines, grey literature, and statistical yearbooks, were used. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainty on the base case estimates. With an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio equal to international dollars (int$) 22,518.03 per quality-adjusted life-years gained, the intervention can be classified as very cost-effective. If adopted nationwide, it would help prevent at least 13,400 MIs, 30,500 strokes, and more than 10,600 and 17,100 MI- and stroke-related deaths. The discounted cost savings generated for the health care system by those who consume the fortified milk powder would amount to int$8.1 per person, corresponding to 0.7% of the total yearly health expenditure per capita. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Together with other preventive interventions, the consumption of milk powder fortified with potassium and phytosterols represents a cost-effective strategy to attenuate the rapid increase in cardiovascular burden in Malaysia.",2019-01-29369,31151244,Nutrients,Anita E Gandola,2019,11 / 6,,No,31151244,"Anita E Gandola; Livia Dainelli; Diane Zimmermann; Maznah Dahlui; Patrick Detzel; Milk Powder Fortified with Potassium and Phytosterols to Decrease the Risk of Cardiovascular Events among the Adult Population in Malaysia: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Nutrients, 2019 May 30; 11(6):2072-6643",QALY,Malaysia,Not Stated,Other,Milk powder fortified with potassium and phytosterols vs. None,Not Stated,75 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,22518.03,International,2016,24282.27

20830,Cost-Effectiveness of Early Treatment with Originator Biologics or Their Biosimilars After Methotrexate Failure in Patients with Established Rheumatoid Arthritis,"INTRODUCTION: Evidence supports the clinical benefits of early aggressive biologic treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have an inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), but the cost-effectiveness of early intervention with originator biologics such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) or their biosimilars has not been well studied. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and utilities for patients with established RA who do not respond to methotrexate (MTX) therapy. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted comparing a standard intervention pathway (addition of originator biologic TNFis to MTX monotherapy at 12 months) and two early intervention pathways (either addition of originator biologic TNFis or addition of biosimilar TNFis to MTX monotherapy at 6 months). RESULTS: Early intervention with an originator biologic TNFi at 6 months was associated with increases in total lifetime costs of pound1692 and utilities of 0.10 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient compared with standard intervention at 12 months, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound17,335/QALY. Early intervention with a biosimilar TNFi increased costs by pound70 and utilities by 0.10 QALYs per patient and was associated with an ICER of pound713/QALY.

20832,Cost-effectiveness of repeated interventions on failing arteriovenous fistulas,"OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) used for hemodialysis commonly undergo multiple percutaneous and open interventions to maintain functional patency, but it is unclear whether this strategy is cost-effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of performing repeated interventions vs starting a new AVF. METHODS: We reviewed all patients with mature radiocephalic, brachiocephalic, and brachiobasilic AVFs at a single academic institution between 2007 and 2015 and assessed the clinical effectiveness of each open and percutaneous intervention to maintain functional patency after the fistula was created. These data were used to parameterize a Markov simulation model to determine the cost-effectiveness for performing an open or percutaneous intervention vs creating an AVF at a new anatomic location. This model compared strategies of creating a new AVF after the first to fourth reintervention within a 1-year time window, with the reference being creation of a new AVF on the fourth reintervention. Costs were measured from Medicare''s perspective, and effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and time in functional access. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated by taking the ratio of the difference in cost and the difference in effectiveness between two strategies. RESULTS: A total of 720 AVFs that were created during the 8-year period reached maturity, and 407 (56%) underwent at least one intervention to maintain functional patency, with the median (interquartile range) time to first reintervention of 12.6 (10-17) months. For the strategies of creating a new AVF after the first versus the fourth reintervention, payer costs ranged from $3519 to $3922 for open procedures and $2134 to $3922 for percutaneous procedures. The ICERs for open interventions on failing AVFs were $357,143/QALY after the first reintervention and $95,876/QALY after the second reintervention. The ICERs for percutaneous interventions on failing AVFs ranged from $1,522,078/QALY after the first reintervention to $443,243/QALY after the third reintervention.

METHODS: We reviewed all patients with mature radiocephalic, brachiocephalic, and brachiobasilic AVFs at a single academic institution between 2007 and 2015 and assessed the clinical effectiveness of each open and percutaneous intervention to maintain functional patency after the fistula was created. These data were used to parameterize a Markov simulation model to determine the cost-effectiveness for performing an open or percutaneous intervention vs creating an AVF at a new anatomic location. This model compared strategies of creating a new AVF after the first to fourth reintervention within a 1-year time window, with the reference being creation of a new AVF on the fourth reintervention. Costs were measured from Medicare''s perspective, and effectiveness was measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and time in functional access. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated by taking the ratio of the difference in cost and the difference in effectiveness between two strategies. RESULTS: A total of 720 AVFs that were created during the 8-year period reached maturity, and 407 (56%) underwent at least one intervention to maintain functional patency, with the median (interquartile range) time to first reintervention of 12.6 (10-17) months. For the strategies of creating a new AVF after the first versus the fourth reintervention, payer costs ranged from $3519 to $3922 for open procedures and $2134 to $3922 for percutaneous procedures. The ICERs for open interventions on failing AVFs were $357,143/QALY after the first reintervention and $95,876/QALY after the second reintervention. The ICERs for percutaneous interventions on failing AVFs ranged from $1,522,078/QALY after the first reintervention to $443,243/QALY after the third reintervention. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas the clinical effectiveness of performing percutaneous interventions on failing AVFs diminishes after each reintervention, they are nevertheless less costly than creating a new AVF.

20838,A Cost-Utility Study of Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for the Treatment of Symptomatic Gallstones,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a high-volume surgery that is an end-stage treatment for gallstones. There is little understanding of the surgery''s effect on the gain in patients'' health relative to its cost. The objective of this study is to measure health gain, cost and cost utility of elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: Participants completed the EQ-5D(3L) pre-operatively and post-operatively. Quality adjusted life years attributable to cholecystectomy were calculated by comparing health state utility values between the pre- and post-operative time points. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy cost was calculated from a health system perspective and included hospital and specialists'' fees (in 2016 Canadian dollars). Cost per QALY was calculated for the entire sample and demographic sub-groups. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 135 participants who completed surveys between February 2013 and June 2017. The response rate among eligible patients was 50%. Assuming that health gain accrued to the participant for 25 years after cholecystectomy, the mean gain in QALYs was 1.7430, corresponding to an average cost per QALY of $2102. Older patients, on average, had less gain in QALYs than younger patients. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic cholecystectomies are inexpensive relative to the gains in health they provide patients. The gains in health were not uniform across age categories. These results should provide health system planners confidence that incremental increases in surgical capacity for elective cholecystectomies is beneficial.",2019-01-29389,31144191,J Gastrointest Surg,Jason M Sutherland,2019,/,,No,31144191,"Jason M Sutherland; Janice Mok; Guiping Liu; Ahmer Karimuddin; Trafford Crump; A Cost-Utility Study of Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for the Treatment of Symptomatic Gallstones, J Gastrointest Surg, 2019 May 29; ():1091-255X",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Surgical,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy vs. None,symptomatic gallstones,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"25 Years, Lifetime",3.50,3.50,2102,Canada,2016,1713.18
20839,Cost-Effectiveness of Canagliflozin Versus Dapagliflozin Added to Metformin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes in China,"Purpose: Agents that inhibit sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), including canagliflozin and dapagliflozin, become available for the treatment of Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This study assessed the economic outcomes of canagliflozin 100 mg versus dapagliflozin 10 mg in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin in the Chinese context. Materials and Methods: Economic outcomes were projected by using the validated Chinese Outcomes Model for T2DM (COMT). Efficacy and safety, medical expenditure, and utility data were derived from the literature, which were assigned to model variables for estimating the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The analysis was conducted from the perspective of Chinese healthcare service providers. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Health outcomes and costs were discounted at 5%. Results: Relative to dapagliflozin 10 mg, treatment with canagliflozin 100 mg was associated with additional 0.015 expected life years per patients treated and 0.013 QALYs gained, which was driven by the reduced risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications over lifetime horizon. The incremental cost of canagliflozin 100 mg versus dapagliflozin 10 mg was US $-129, which indicated the canagliflozin 100 mg strategy was a dominant option. The univariate sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were sensitive to several model inputs. Conclusion: These results suggested that canagliflozin was a cost-saving treatment option compared with dapagliflozin from the perspective of Chinese health care services providers for Chinese patients with T2DM who are inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.",2019-01-29391,31143117,Front Pharmacol,Xingyun Hou,2019,10 /,480,No,31143117,"Xingyun Hou; Xu Wan; Bin Wu; Cost-Effectiveness of Canagliflozin Versus Dapagliflozin Added to Metformin in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes in China, Front Pharmacol, 2019; 10():1663-9812; 480",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Canagliflozin 100 mg vs. Dapagliflozin 10 mg,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-6450,United States,2017,-6810.26
20840,Stage- and age-adjusted cost-effectiveness analysis of laparoscopic surgery in rectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: It has been argued that laparoscopy should be a standard treatment in rectal cancer due to its greater technical complexity. The objective of this study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare laparoscopy with open surgery for rectal cancer adjusting for age and clinical stage. METHODS: A real-world prospective cost-effectiveness cohort study was conducted with data on costs and effectiveness at individual patient level. A ""genetic matching"" algorithm was used to correct for selection bias. After balancing the sample groups, combined multivariate analysis of total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was performed using seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) models. These models were first constructed without interactions and, subsequently, effects of any age-stage interaction were analyzed. RESULTS: The sample included 601 patients (400 by laparoscopy and 201 by open surgery). Crude cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that overall laparoscopy was cheaper and associated with higher QALYs. The SUR models without interactions showed that while laparoscopy remained dominant, the incremental effectiveness decreased to the point that it offered no statistically significant benefits over open surgery. In the subgroup analysis, at advanced stages of the disease, although none of the coefficients were significant, the mean incremental effectiveness (QALYs value) for laparoscopy was positive in younger patients and negative in older patients. Further, for advanced stages, the mean cost of open surgery was lower in both age subgroups but differences did not reach statistical significance. In early stages, laparoscopy cost was significantly lower in the subgroup younger than 70 and higher in the older subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of laparoscopy in surgery for rectal cancer justifies this being the standard surgical procedure in young patients and those at initial stages. The choice of procedure should be discussed with patients who are older and/or in advanced stages of the disease.

20841,The impact and cost-effectiveness of user fee exemption by contracting out essential health package services in Malawi,"Objectives: To examine the impact and cost-effectiveness of user fee exemption by contracting out essential health package services to Christian Health Association of Malawi (CHAM) facilities through service-level agreements (SLAs) to inform policy-making in Malawi. Methods: The analysis was conducted from the government perspective. Financial and service utilisation data were collected for January 2015 through December 2016. The impact of SLAs on utilisation of maternal and child health (MCH) services was examined using propensity score matching and random-effects models. Subsequently, the improved services were converted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were generated. Findings: Over the 2 years, a total of $1.5 million was disbursed to CHAM facilities through SLAs, equivalent to $1.24 per capita. SLAs were associated with a 13.8%, 13.1%, 19.2% and 9.6% increase in coverage of antenatal visits, postnatal visits, delivery by skilled birth attendants and BCG vaccinations, respectively. This was translated into 434 lives saved (95% CI 355 to 512) or 11 161 QALYs gained (95% CI 9125 to 13 174). The ICER of SLAs was estimated at $134.7/QALYs gained (95% CI $114.1 to $164.7). Conclusions: The cost per QALY gained for SLAs was estimated at $134.7, representing 0.37 of Malawi''s per capita gross domestic product ($363). Thus, MCH services provided with Malawi''s SLAs proved cost-effective. Future refinements of SLAs could introduce pay for performance, revising the price list, streamlining the reporting system and strengthening CHAM facilities'' financial and monitoring management capacity.",2019-01-29403,31139447,BMJ Glob Health,Wu Zeng,2019,4 / 2,e001286,No,31139447,"Wu Zeng; Daxin Sun; Henry Mphwanthe; Tianwen Huan; Jae Eun Nam; Pascal Saint-Firmin; Gerald Manthalu; Suneeta Sharma; Arin Dutta; The impact and cost-effectiveness of user fee exemption by contracting out essential health package services in Malawi, BMJ Glob Health, 2019; 4(2):2059-7908; e001286",QALY,Malawi,Not Stated,Care Delivery,Contracting out essential health package services vs. Non-service level agreement and mixed user fee charge system,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,134.7,United States,2016,145.25
20842,Association of Pharmacist Prescription of Hormonal Contraception With Unintended Pregnancies and Medicaid Costs,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate unintended pregnancies averted and the cost effectiveness of pharmacist prescription of hormonal contraception. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to determine the cost effectiveness of expanding the scope of pharmacists to prescribe hormonal contraception compared with the standard of care and contraceptive access in clinics. Our perspective was that of the payor, Oregon Medicaid. Our primary outcome was unintended pregnancies averted. Secondary outcomes included: costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Model inputs were obtained from an analysis of Medicaid claims for the first 24 months after policy implementation in Oregon, and the literature. Univariate and bivariate sensitivity analyses, as well as a Monte Carlo simulation, were performed. RESULTS: Among Oregon''s Medicaid population at risk for unintended pregnancy, the policy expanding the scope of pharmacists to prescribe hormonal contraception averted an estimated 51 unintended pregnancies and saved $1.6 million dollars. Quality of life was also improved, with 158 QALYs gained per 198,000 women. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the model was most sensitive to the effect on contraceptive continuation rates. If contraceptive continuation rates among women receiving care from a pharmacist are 10% less than among clinicians, than pharmacist prescription of hormonal contraception will not avert unintended pregnancies. CONCLUSION: Pharmacist prescription of hormonal contraception averts unintended pregnancies and is cost effective. Full implementation of the policy is needed for maximum benefits.

20846,Evaluation of Cancer-Based Criteria for Use in Mainstream BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genetic Testing in Patients With Breast Cancer,"Importance: Increasing BRCA1 and BRCA2 (collectively termed herein as BRCA) gene testing is required to improve cancer management and prevent BRCA-related cancers. Objective: To evaluate mainstream genetic testing using cancer-based criteria in patients with cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: A quality improvement study and cost-effectiveness analysis of different BRCA testing selection criteria and access procedures to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and mutation detection performance was conducted at the Royal Marsden National Health Service Foundation Trust as part of the Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics (MCG) Programme. Participants included 1184 patients with cancer who were undergoing genetic testing between September 1, 2013, and February 28, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mutation rates, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were the primary outcomes. Results: Of the 1184 patients (1158 women [97.8%]) meeting simple cancer-based criteria, 117 had a BRCA mutation (9.9%). The mutation rate was similar in retrospective United Kingdom (10.2% [235 of 2294]) and prospective Malaysian (9.7% [103 of 1061]) breast cancer studies. If traditional family history criteria had been used, more than 50% of the mutation-positive individuals would have been missed. Of the 117 mutation-positive individuals, 115 people (98.3%) attended their genetics appointment and cascade to relatives is underway in all appropriate families (85 of 85). Combining with the equivalent ovarian cancer study provides 5 simple cancer-based criteria for BRCA testing with a 10% mutation rate: (1) ovarian cancer; (2) breast cancer diagnosed when patients are 45 years or younger; (3) 2 primary breast cancers, both diagnosed when patients are 60 years or younger; (4) triple-negative breast cancer; and (5) male breast cancer. A sixth criterion-breast cancer plus a parent, sibling, or child with any of the other criteria-can be added to address family history. Criteria 1 through 5 are considered the MCG criteria, and criteria 1 through 6 are considered the MCGplus criteria. Testing using MCG or MCGplus criteria is cost-effective with cost-effectiveness ratios of $1330 per discounted QALYs and $1225 per discounted QALYs, respectively, and appears to lead to cancer and mortality reductions (MCG: 804 cancers, 161 deaths; MCGplus: 1020 cancers, 204 deaths per year over 50 years). Use of MCG or MCGplus criteria might allow detection of all BRCA mutations in patients with breast cancer in the United Kingdom through testing one-third of patients. Feedback questionnaires from 259 patients and 23 cancer team members (12 oncologists, 8 surgeons, and 3 nurse specialists) showed acceptability of the process with 100% of patients pleased they had genetic testing and 100% of cancer team members confident to approve patients for genetic testing. Use of MCGplus criteria also appeared to be time and resource efficient, requiring 95% fewer genetic consultations than the traditional process. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that mainstream testing using simple, cancer-based criteria might be able to efficiently deliver consistent, cost-effective, patient-centered BRCA testing.",2019-01-29451,31125106,JAMA Netw Open,Zoe Kemp,2019,2 / 5,e194428,No,31125106,"Zoe Kemp; Alice Turnbull; Shawn Yost; Sheila Seal; Shazia Mahamdallie; Emma Poyastro-Pearson; Margaret Warren-Perry; Anthony Eccleston; Min-Min Tan; Soo Hwang Teo; Nicholas Turner; Ann Strydom; Angela George; Nazneen Rahman; Evaluation of Cancer-Based Criteria for Use in Mainstream BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genetic Testing in Patients With Breast Cancer, JAMA Netw Open, 2019 May 3; 2(5):2574-3805; e194428",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Medical Device, Other",BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genetic Testing using Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics criteria vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,1225,United States,2017,1293.42

Design, Setting, and Participants: A quality improvement study and cost-effectiveness analysis of different BRCA testing selection criteria and access procedures to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and mutation detection performance was conducted at the Royal Marsden National Health Service Foundation Trust as part of the Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics (MCG) Programme. Participants included 1184 patients with cancer who were undergoing genetic testing between September 1, 2013, and February 28, 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mutation rates, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were the primary outcomes. Results: Of the 1184 patients (1158 women [97.8%]) meeting simple cancer-based criteria, 117 had a BRCA mutation (9.9%). The mutation rate was similar in retrospective United Kingdom (10.2% [235 of 2294]) and prospective Malaysian (9.7% [103 of 1061]) breast cancer studies. If traditional family history criteria had been used, more than 50% of the mutation-positive individuals would have been missed. Of the 117 mutation-positive individuals, 115 people (98.3%) attended their genetics appointment and cascade to relatives is underway in all appropriate families (85 of 85). Combining with the equivalent ovarian cancer study provides 5 simple cancer-based criteria for BRCA testing with a 10% mutation rate: (1) ovarian cancer; (2) breast cancer diagnosed when patients are 45 years or younger; (3) 2 primary breast cancers, both diagnosed when patients are 60 years or younger; (4) triple-negative breast cancer; and (5) male breast cancer. A sixth criterion-breast cancer plus a parent, sibling, or child with any of the other criteria-can be added to address family history. Criteria 1 through 5 are considered the MCG criteria, and criteria 1 through 6 are considered the MCGplus criteria. Testing using MCG or MCGplus criteria is cost-effective with cost-effectiveness ratios of $1330 per discounted QALYs and $1225 per discounted QALYs, respectively, and appears to lead to cancer and mortality reductions (MCG: 804 cancers, 161 deaths; MCGplus: 1020 cancers, 204 deaths per year over 50 years). Use of MCG or MCGplus criteria might allow detection of all BRCA mutations in patients with breast cancer in the United Kingdom through testing one-third of patients. Feedback questionnaires from 259 patients and 23 cancer team members (12 oncologists, 8 surgeons, and 3 nurse specialists) showed acceptability of the process with 100% of patients pleased they had genetic testing and 100% of cancer team members confident to approve patients for genetic testing. Use of MCGplus criteria also appeared to be time and resource efficient, requiring 95% fewer genetic consultations than the traditional process. Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that mainstream testing using simple, cancer-based criteria might be able to efficiently deliver consistent, cost-effective, patient-centered BRCA testing.",2019-01-29451,31125106,JAMA Netw Open,Zoe Kemp,2019,2 / 5,e194428,No,31125106,"Zoe Kemp; Alice Turnbull; Shawn Yost; Sheila Seal; Shazia Mahamdallie; Emma Poyastro-Pearson; Margaret Warren-Perry; Anthony Eccleston; Min-Min Tan; Soo Hwang Teo; Nicholas Turner; Ann Strydom; Angela George; Nazneen Rahman; Evaluation of Cancer-Based Criteria for Use in Mainstream BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genetic Testing in Patients With Breast Cancer, JAMA Netw Open, 2019 May 3; 2(5):2574-3805; e194428",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Medical Device",BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genetic Testing using Mainstreaming Cancer Genetics criteria vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,1330,United States,2017,1404.29
20848,Cost-effectiveness of the coronary sinus Reducer and its impact on the healthcare burden of refractory angina patients,"AIMS: The Coronary Sinus Reducer is a percutaneous device proven to improve angina symptoms in refractory angina (RA). We evaluated its potential cost-effectiveness and impact on the healthcare resource use. METHODS AND RESULTS: Angina-related healthcare resource usage and quality-of-life data were collected for 215 consecutive RA patients undergoing Reducer implantion in Belgium, The Netherlands and Italy. Costs were assessed from each country''s healthcare system perspective. Data from the date of RA diagnosis to Reducer implantation (Standard-of-Care [SoC]-period) and from Reducer implantation to follow-up (Reducer-period) were compared: during Reducer-period a significant reduction in angina-driven hospitalizations, outpatient vists, coronary angiograms and percutaneous coronary interventions per patient-year was observed, translating into significantly reduced costs per patient-year.To assess cost-effectiveness, costs and utilities of one-year SoC were compared with those of one-year Reducer-period. Assumptions on Reducer efficacy duration were further explored with modeled projections. Reducer was associated with higher quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs: 0.665 vs 0.580, p < 0.001) and incremental costs, yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 53197, 34948, 63146 euro/QALY gained in Belgium, Netherlands and Italy, respectively. Under both the assumptions of 2 and 3 years Reducer effect duration with a 30%-year efficacy decrease, the device yielded ICERs in the range of 1977 - 20796 euro/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with RA, Reducer device decreases healthcare resource use and related costs.

20851,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of population-based glaucoma screening in China: a decision-analytic Markov model,"BACKGROUND: Glaucoma, particularly primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), is a leading cause of global blindness. Nearly half of all people with PACG are of Chinese descent. Population-level glaucoma screening has generally not been found to be cost-effective in high-income countries; however, this assessment has rarely been done in low-income or middle-income countries. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of population-level glaucoma screening in China. METHODS: We developed decision-analytic Markov models for separate and combined screening for PACG and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) to evaluate costs and benefits of community-level screening versus opportunistic case finding from a societal perspective. A cohort of individuals was followed in the model from age 50 years through a total of 30 1-year Markov cycles. Analyses were done separately for rural and urban settings. We did a meta-analysis of glaucoma prevalence studies in China to obtain prevalence estimates for PACG and POAG. Screening costs were taken from a Chinese screening programme and treatment costs from a tertiary Chinese eye hospital. Main outcomes were incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) using quality-adjusted life-years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) using years of blindness avoided. We did one-way deterministic and simulated probabilistic sensitivity analyses to reflect uncertainty around ICURs and ICERs. FINDINGS: Compared with no screening, combined screening of POAG and PACG in rural China is predicted to result in an ICUR of US$569 (95% CI 17 to 4180) and an ICER of $1280 (-58 to 7940), both of which are below the WHO cost-effectiveness threshold of one to three times rural gross domestic product. For the urban China setting, combined screening is predicted to result in fewer net costs and greater gain in health benefits than no screening. Findings were robust in all sensitivity analyses. Over 30 years, a total of 246 (95% CI 63 to 628) and 1325 (510 to 2828) years of blindness are predicted to be avoided for every 100 000 rural and urban residents screened, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Population screening for glaucoma (POAG and PACG combined) is likely to be cost-effective in both urban and rural China.

20857,Is risk-stratified breast cancer screening economically efficient in Germany?,"OBJECTIVES: Risk stratification has so far been evaluated under the assumption that women fully adhere to screening recommendations. However, the participation in German cancer screening programs remains low at 54%. The question arises whether risk-stratified screening is economically efficient under the assumption that adherence is not perfect. METHOD: We have adapted a micro-simulation Markov model to the German context. Annual, biennial, and triennial routine screening are compared with five risk-adapted strategies using thresholds of relative risk to stratify screening frequencies. We used three outcome variables (mortality reduction, quality-adjusted life years, and false-positive results) under the assumption of full adherence vs. an adherence rate of 54%. Strategies are evaluated using efficiency frontiers and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). RESULTS: The reduced adherence rate affects both performance and cost; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios remain constant. The results of PSA show that risk-stratified screening strategies are more efficient than biennial routine screening under certain conditions. At any willingness-to-pay (WTP), there is a risk-stratified alternative with a higher likelihood of being the best choice. However, without explicit decision criteria and WTP, risk-stratified screening is not more efficient than biennial routine screening. Potential improvements in the adherence rates have significant health gains and budgetary implications. CONCLUSION: If the participation rate for mammographic screening is as low as in Germany, stratified screening is not clearly more efficient than routine screening but dependent on the WTP. A more promising design for future stratified strategies is the combination of risk stratification mechanisms with interventions to improve the low adherence in selected high-risk groups.",2019-01-29463,31120970,PLoS One,Matthias Arnold,2019,14 / 5,e0217213,No,31120970,"Matthias Arnold; Katharina Pfeifer; Anne S Quante; Is risk-stratified breast cancer screening economically efficient in Germany?, PLoS One , 2019; 14(5):1932-6203; e0217213",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Screening,Annual breast cancer screening vs. Triennial routine screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,43591,Euro,2017,52011.44
20858,Economic evaluation of a phase III international randomised controlled trial of very early mobilisation after stroke (AVERT),"OBJECTIVES: While very early mobilisation (VEM) intervention for stroke patients was shown not to be effective at 3 months, 12 month clinical and economical outcomes remain unknown. The aim was to assess cost-effectiveness of a VEM intervention within a phase III randomised controlled trial (RCT). DESIGN: An economic evaluation alongside a RCT, and detailed resource use and cost analysis over 12 months post-acute stroke. SETTING: Multi-country RCT involved 58 stroke centres. PARTICIPANTS: 2104 patients with acute stroke who were admitted to a stroke unit. INTERVENTION: A very early rehabilitation intervention within 24 hours of stroke onset METHODS: Cost-utility analyses were undertaken according to pre-specified protocol measuring VEM against usual care (UC) based on 12 month outcomes. The analysis was conducted using both health sector and societal perspectives. Unit costs were sourced from participating countries. Details on resource use (both health and non-health) were sourced from cost case report form. Dichotomised modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores (0 to 2 vs 3 to 6) and quality adjusted-life years (QALYs) were used to compare the treatment effect of VEM and UC. The base case analysis was performed on an intention-to-treat basis and 95% CI for cost and QALYs were estimated by bootstrapping. Sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the robustness of base case results. RESULTS: VEM and UC groups were comparable in the quantity of resource use and cost of each component. There were no differences in the probability of achieving a favourable mRS outcome (0.030, 95% CI -0.022 to 0.082), QALYs (0.013, 95% CI -0.041 to 0.016) and cost (AUD1082, 95% CI -$2520 to $4685 from a health sector perspective or AUD102, 95% CI -$6907 to $7111, from a societal perspective including productivity cost). Sensitivity analysis achieved results with mostly overlapped CIs. CONCLUSIONS: VEM and UC were associated with comparable costs, mRS outcome and QALY gains at 12 months. Compared with to UC, VEM is unlikely to be cost-effective. The long-term data collection during the trial also informed resource use and cost of care post-acute stroke across five participating countries.

20859,"Health gains, costs and cost-effectiveness of a population-based screening programme for abdominal aortic aneurysms","BACKGROUND: Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture carries a high fatality rate. AAAs can be detected before rupture by abdominal ultrasound imaging, allowing elective repair. Population-based screening for AAA in older men reduces AAA-related mortality by about 40 per cent. The UK began an AAA screening programme offering one-off scans to men aged 65 years in 2009. Sweden has a similar programme. Currently, there is no AAA screening programme in New Zealand. This cost-utility analysis aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a UK-style screening programme in the New Zealand setting. METHODS: The analysis compared a formal AAA screening programme (one-off abdominal ultrasound imaging for about 20 000 men aged 65 years in 2011) with no systematic screening. A Markov macrosimulation model was adapted to estimate the health gains (in quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs), health system costs and cost-effectiveness in New Zealand. A health system perspective and lifetime horizon was adopted. RESULTS: With New Zealand-specific inputs, the adapted model produced an estimate of about NZ $15 300 (euro7746) per QALY gained, with a 95 per cent uncertainty interval (UI) of NZ $8700 to 31 000 (euro4405 to 15 694) per QALY gained. Health gains were estimated at 117 (95 per cent UI 53 to 212) QALYs. Health system costs were NZ $1.68 million (euro850 535), with a 95 per cent UI of NZ $820 200 to 3.24 million (euro415 243 to euro1.65 million). CONCLUSION: Using New Zealand''s gross domestic product per capita (about NZ $45 000 or euro22 100) as a cost-effectiveness threshold, a UK-style AAA screening programme would be cost-effective in New Zealand.",2019-01-29479,31115915,J Clin Psychopharmacol,N Nair,2019,106 / 8,1043-1054,No,31115915,"N Nair; G Kvizhinadze; G T Jones; R Rush; M Khashram; J Roake; A Blakely; Health gains, costs and cost-effectiveness of a population-based screening programme for abdominal aortic aneurysms, J Clin Psychopharmacol, 2019 Jul; 106(8):0271-0749; 1043-1054",QALY,New Zealand,Not Stated,Screening,Abdominal aortic aneurysm screening programs vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,13666.67,New Zealand,2011,19890.26
20860,"Cost-Effectiveness of Active Surveillance, Radical Prostatectomy, and External Beam Radiotherapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: An Analysis of the ProtecT Trial","BACKGROUND: Despite increasing emphasis on value-based care, the cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) management options has not been compared using prospective clinical trial data. The prostate testing for cancer and treatment (ProtecT) trial demonstrated no difference in survival for patients randomized to active surveillance (AS), external beam radiotherapy (RT), or radical prostatectomy (RP). Herein, we compare the cost-effectiveness among the arms of ProtecT. METHODS: A Markov model compared the cost-effectiveness of AS, RP, and RT based on ProtecT outcomes; specifically, 6-year quality of life data and 10 year oncologic data. Costs were based on 2017 Medicare reimbursement while utility values were assigned from the literature. Univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: At 6 years after randomization, mean costs per patient were $12,143 (AS), $17,781 (RP), and $29,238 (RT). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to AS was $133,314/QALY for RP and $389,915/QALY for RT. At 10 years after randomization, both RP ($5,627/QALY) and RT ($78,291/QALY) were found to be more cost-effective than AS. The model was sensitive to the metastasis rate on AS, with a threshold of 2.4% at 10 years, below which AS was more cost-effective than RP. On multivariable sensitivity analysis at 10 years, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, the most cost-effective strategy was RP in 45%, RT in 30%, and AS in 25% of model micro-simulations.

20862,Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with nedaplatin versus cisplatin in stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Nedaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy became an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregional, advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, we simulated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma from disease-free to death. Input data for the model were collected from published literature and the standard fee database of West China Hospital. The outcome was expressed in quality-adjusted-years (QALYs), net monetary benefit at the threshold of $25,841, three times the Gross Domestic Product of China in 2017. The costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually and a half-cycle correction was considered. The input parameters were varied in one-way sensitivity analysis to confirm the robustness of the model. All of the primary analyses used second-order probabilistic sensitivity analysis to capture the impact of parameter uncertainty based on 10,000 Monte-Carlo simulations. RESULTS: The mean QALYs of treatment in stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma were comparable: 2.90 QALYs for nedaplatin and 3.12 QALYs for cisplatin. Nedaplatin cost $34,505 compared with $27,167 for cisplatin, generating an incremental net monetary benefit of nedaplatin versus cisplatin of $-13,357 at the ceiling ratio of $25,841. The results of nedaplatin remained cost-ineffective over the majority of the sensitivity analyses. The cost-effectiveness curve showed that the probability of strategies being cost-effective were 0% for nedaplatin and 100% for cisplatin in stage II-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma at any willingness-to-pay threshold.

METHODS: We developed a state-transition Markov model simulating the progression of CHC. Long-term outcomes included remaining life expectancy in life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Short-term outcomes included sustained virological response rates (SVR). Direct medical costs were obtained from Brazilian databases. A lifelong time horizon was considered and a 5% annual discount rate was applied for costs and clinical outcomes. A willingness-to-pay threshold of approximately $20 000 per QALY was used. We performed multiple sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For short- and long-term scenarios, therapy with boceprevir was dominated by telaprevir, which was more effective than standard dual therapy (75.0% vs 40.4% SVR rate, 13.47 vs 12.59 LYs, and 9.74 vs 8.49 QALYs, respectively) and was also more expensive ($15 742 vs $5413).

This study aim to assess the cost-effectiveness for the treatment of diarrhea in emergency services in the management of children of acute gastroenteritis with non-severe dehydration. METHODS: A stochastic decision tree model considering the perspective of the Brazilian public health system was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of the 5 interventions: oral rehydration therapy (ORT) at home, and if it fails supervised ORT; they would receive; ORT at home, and if it fails intravenous rehydration therapy (IVT). ORT at home and if it fails, the half of them will receive supervised ORT, and the other half would receive IVT; Patient receives supervised oral treatment; Patient receives IVT. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used to measure the clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The strategy of initiating oral rehydration in children younger than 5 is the most efficient practice with a cost of $14.28 and effectiveness of 0.89 QALYs.

20872,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Adding Palbociclib as a Second-Line Endocrine Therapy for HR(+)/HER2(-) Metastatic Breast Cancer From the US and Chinese Perspectives,"PURPOSE: As a second-line endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR(+)/HER2(-)) metastatic breast cancer, palbociclib has demonstrated significant efficacy in prolonging progression-free survival when added to a regimen containing fulvestrant. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of palbociclib from the perspectives of the United States and China. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs, overall life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to predict the uncertainty of the model developed. The time horizon was 10 years, and the perspective was that of the payer. FINDINGS: Within a 10-year time horizon, the palbociclib-containing strategy provided an additional 0.568 QALY, with an ICER of 88,854 USD/QALY, in the United States. When palbociclib cost 30%, 20%, and 10% of the current price, the ICERs were 185,526, 42,193, and 98,860 USD/QALY, respectively. In China, the ICER was 182,779 USD/QALY. When palbociclib cost 30%, 20%, and 10% of the current price, the ICERs were 79,558, 64,812, and 50,066 USD/QALY, respectively. In order to meet 50% probability of cost-effectiveness, the estimated price would have to be 32.52 USD/100 mg at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 58,480 USD/QALY (3 x per-capita domestic product of Beijing, China). IMPLICATIONS: Adding palbociclib to a regimen of fulvestrant is unlikely to be cost-effective as a second-line endocrine therapy for HR(+)/HER2(-) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with at the current price in the United States and China.

20879,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Adding Palbociclib as a Second-Line Endocrine Therapy for HR(+)/HER2(-) Metastatic Breast Cancer From the US and Chinese Perspectives,"PURPOSE: As a second-line endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR(+)/HER2(-)) metastatic breast cancer, palbociclib has demonstrated significant efficacy in prolonging progression-free survival when added to a regimen containing fulvestrant. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of palbociclib from the perspectives of the United States and China. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate lifetime costs, overall life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to predict the uncertainty of the model developed. The time horizon was 10 years, and the perspective was that of the payer. FINDINGS: Within a 10-year time horizon, the palbociclib-containing strategy provided an additional 0.568 QALY, with an ICER of 88,854 USD/QALY, in the United States. When palbociclib cost 30%, 20%, and 10% of the current price, the ICERs were 185,526, 42,193, and 98,860 USD/QALY, respectively. In China, the ICER was 182,779 USD/QALY.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab, an interleukin-17A inhibitor, versus other biologics in PsA from the Argentinean social security perspective. METHODS: A semi-Markov model evaluated subcutaneous (sc) treatment with secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg against other sc treatments such as adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, ustekinumab, and intravenous treatment infliximab in biologic-naive (with or without moderate to severe psoriasis) and biologic-experienced PsA patients over a lifetime horizon. Response to treatments was determined using the PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) at 12 weeks. Model inputs were derived from randomized controlled trials, network meta-analyses, published literature, and other Argentinean sources. Model outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Sensitivity analyses and alternative scenarios with a higher cost option were also conducted. RESULTS: Among biologic-naive PsA patients without psoriasis, secukinumab 150 mg provided the highest QALYs (7.18) versus all sc biologics at the lowest cost ($3 755 678 Argentine peso), thus dominating them. Among biologic-naive PsA patients with psoriasis and biologic-experienced PsA patients, secukinumab 300 mg provided highest QALYs (6.99 and 7.53, respectively), dominated infliximab, and was cost-effective versus other sc biologics. Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated sensitivity of results to variation in PsARC rates, drug acquisition costs, Health Assessment Questionnaire change, and utilities. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed maximum net monetary benefits with both secukinumab doses. Results from an alternative scenario analysis were similar to base-case analysis.

20886,Ulipristal acetate compared to levonorgestrel emergency contraception among current oral contraceptive users: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of ulipristal acetate (UPA) and levonorgestrel (LNG) emergency contraception (EC) on pregnancy prevention among combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill users with an extended pill-free interval. We accounted for the potential interaction of COCs and obesity on EC efficacy. METHODS: We built a decision-analytic model using TreeAge software to evaluate the optimal oral EC strategy in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 twenty-five-year-old women midcycle with a prolonged ""missed"" pill episode (8-14days). We used a 5-year time horizon and 3% discount rate. From a healthcare perspective, we obtained probabilities, utilities and costs inflated to 2018 dollars from the literature. We set the threshold for cost-effectiveness at a standard $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. We included the following clinical outcomes: number of protected cycles, unintended pregnancies, abortions, deliveries and costs. RESULTS: We found that UPA was the optimal method of oral EC, as it resulted in 720 fewer unintended pregnancies, 736 fewer abortions and 80 fewer deliveries at a total cost savings of $50,323 and 79 additional adjusted life-years. UPA continued to be the optimal strategy even in the case of obesity or COCs impacting UPA efficacy, in which a COC interaction would have to change efficacy of UPA by 160% before LNG was the dominant strategy. CONCLUSION: Our models found that UPA was the dominant choice of oral EC among COC users with a prolonged ""missed"" pill episode, regardless of body mass index or an adverse interaction of COCs on UPA.

The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sacubitril/valsartan use in South Korea for treating patients with HFrEF compared with that of enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). METHODS: A Markov model was designed to estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of treatment for patients with HFrEF. Cohorts in the alive-state incurred a monthly risk of hospitalization because of deteriorated HF, adverse events (AEs), or death. Transition probabilities of sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril were estimated by using data from the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial. The effectiveness of ARBs (eg, reduction in mortality and hospitalization rates) was assumed to be identical to that of enalapril, according to the results of the meta-analysis. However, there was no comparative evidence for AEs. We therefore conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis and adjusted the incidence rate of AEs for ARBs. The utility for estimating quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was elicited by the survey of the general South Korean population by using EuroQol-5 dimensions. We calculated the medical costs, including medication, monitoring, hospitalization, AEs, and terminal care, from the health care sector perspective. Costs and effectiveness were discounted by 5%. One-way sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to determine the model robustness. FINDINGS: The total cost per patient for sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril was $25,832 and $18,295, respectively. Sacubitril/valsartan was associated with an approximately 8- month longer life expectancy compared with enalapril and a QALY gain of 0.59. As a result, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for sacubitril/valsartan versus enalapril was $12,722 per QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of sacubitril/valsartan versus ARB was $11,970 with an incurred cost of $18,741 for the ARB group. The main results and those of various sensitivity analyses were lower than a threshold of $20,000.

20889,"Management of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes with Once-Weekly Semaglutide Versus Dulaglutide, Exenatide ER, Liraglutide and Lixisenatide: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis in the Danish Setting","INTRODUCTION: Once-weekly semaglutide is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) that has been associated with greater reductions in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight versus GLP-1 receptor agonists dulaglutide, exenatide extended-release (ER), liraglutide and lixisenatide in the SUSTAIN trial program and a network meta-analysis (NMA). The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of semaglutide versus all available GLP-1 receptor agonists in Denmark, using a clinically orientated treatment approach. METHODS: Outcomes were projected over patient lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model. Baseline characteristics and treatment effects were sourced from the corresponding SUSTAIN trials and the NMA. Patients were assumed to initiate GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy and subsequently treatment-intensify according to clinical treatment guidelines, with addition of basal insulin and switching to basal-bolus insulin occurring when HbA1c exceeded recommended targets. Patients were assumed to receive a GLP-1 receptor agonist plus basal insulin therapy once HbA1c levels reached 7.5% and a basal-bolus insulin regimen once HbA1c exceeded 8.0%. Costs were captured in 2017 Danish kroner (DKK), with future costs and outcomes discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: Primary analyses indicated that semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.11 and 0.34 quality-adjusted life years, respectively, versus dulaglutide, achieved at cost savings of DKK 289 and DKK 13,416, respectively. Supporting analyses indicated that both doses of semaglutide were either cost-effective or dominant versus exenatide ER, liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg and lixisenatide. CONCLUSION: Semaglutide represents a cost-effective alternative to other GLP-1 receptor agonist therapies available in Denmark, demonstrating clinical benefits versus dulaglutide, exenatide ER, liraglutide and lixisenatide for the treatment of patients with T2D.

RESULTS: Primary analyses indicated that semaglutide 0.5 mg and 1 mg were associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.11 and 0.34 quality-adjusted life years, respectively, versus dulaglutide, achieved at cost savings of DKK 289 and DKK 13,416, respectively. Supporting analyses indicated that both doses of semaglutide were either cost-effective or dominant versus exenatide ER, liraglutide 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg and lixisenatide. CONCLUSION: Semaglutide represents a cost-effective alternative to other GLP-1 receptor agonist therapies available in Denmark, demonstrating clinical benefits versus dulaglutide, exenatide ER, liraglutide and lixisenatide for the treatment of patients with T2D.

20899,Cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program,"PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP). METHODS: Using a modified CISNET breast cancer simulation model, we estimated outcomes for women aged 40-64 years associated with three scenarios: breast cancer screening within the NBCCEDP, screening in the absence of the NBCCEDP (no program), and no screening through any program. We report screening outcomes, cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and sensitivity analyses results. RESULTS: Compared with no program and no screening, the NBCCEDP lowers breast cancer mortality and improves QALYs, but raises health care costs. Base-case ICER for the program was $51,754/QALY versus no program and $50,223/QALY versus no screening. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis ICER for the program was $56,615/QALY [95% CI $24,069, $134,230/QALY] versus no program and $51,096/QALY gained [95% CI $26,423, $97,315/QALY] versus no screening.
