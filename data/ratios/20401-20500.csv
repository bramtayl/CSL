20401,Cost-effectiveness of a low-dose computed tomography screening programme for lung cancer in New Zealand,"OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer is uncertain. This study estimated the health gains, costs (net health system, and including ''unrelated'') and cost-effectiveness of biennial LDCT screening among 55-74 years olds with a smoking history of at least 30 pack years, and (if a former smoker) having quit within last 15 years, in New Zealand. METHODS: We used a macrosimulation stage shift model with New Zealand-specific lung cancer incidence rates and intervention parameters from the National Lung Screening Trial, a health system perspective, and a lifetime horizon for quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs discounted at 3% per annum. We also examined heterogeneity by gender, ethnicity (Maori (indigenous population) versus non-Maori), age and current versus ex-smoking status. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We estimated 0.037 QALYs gained (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.024-0.053) per eligible participant, at a cost of US$3606 ($2689-4681). The overall incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was US$104,000 per QALY gained (95% UI US$59,000-US$175,000). The cost-effectiveness varied moderately by socio-demographics, with the ''best'' ICER being US$52,000 for 70-74 year old Maori females and the ''worst'' ICER being US$142,000 for 55-59 year old non-Maori females. The ICER varied little by current smoking status, due to higher competing mortality risk limiting QALY gains for current smokers. The two scenarios that lowered the ICER the most were increasing the screening uptake to 100% (ICER=US$50,000 per QALY), and improving the sensitivity (from 93.8%-98%) and specificity (from 73.4%-95%) of the screening test (ICER=US$42,000 per QALY).

This study estimated the health gains, costs (net health system, and including ''unrelated'') and cost-effectiveness of biennial LDCT screening among 55-74 years olds with a smoking history of at least 30 pack years, and (if a former smoker) having quit within last 15 years, in New Zealand. METHODS: We used a macrosimulation stage shift model with New Zealand-specific lung cancer incidence rates and intervention parameters from the National Lung Screening Trial, a health system perspective, and a lifetime horizon for quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs discounted at 3% per annum. We also examined heterogeneity by gender, ethnicity (Maori (indigenous population) versus non-Maori), age and current versus ex-smoking status.

20421,Cost-effectiveness of a low-dose computed tomography screening programme for lung cancer in New Zealand,"OBJECTIVES: The cost-effectiveness of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer is uncertain. This study estimated the health gains, costs (net health system, and including ''unrelated'') and cost-effectiveness of biennial LDCT screening among 55-74 years olds with a smoking history of at least 30 pack years, and (if a former smoker) having quit within last 15 years, in New Zealand. METHODS: We used a macrosimulation stage shift model with New Zealand-specific lung cancer incidence rates and intervention parameters from the National Lung Screening Trial, a health system perspective, and a lifetime horizon for quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs discounted at 3% per annum. We also examined heterogeneity by gender, ethnicity (Maori (indigenous population) versus non-Maori), age and current versus ex-smoking status. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We estimated 0.037 QALYs gained (95% uncertainty interval (UI) 0.024-0.053) per eligible participant, at a cost of US$3606 ($2689-4681).

20423,Cost-utility analysis of a potential lung cancer screening program for a high-risk population in Germany: A modelling approach,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in Germany. Although several randomized trials in Europe have evaluated the effectiveness of lung cancer screening programs, evidence on the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer screening is scarce. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a population-based lung cancer screening program from the perspective of a German payer. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from the public payer perspective for a high-risk population defined as heavy former and current smokers (>/=20 cigarettes per day) between 55 and 75 years of age. The underlying model consisted of two Markov models. We differentiated between a population-based annual screening program and standard clinical care. Depending on stage at diagnosis, simulated patients were assigned to one of five treatment paths according to the German clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Costs, life years saved, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were used as outcomes. Values for input parameters were taken from the literature. The model was run for 60 cycles with a cycle length of three months. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the base case, annual lung cancer screening led to an increase in incremental costs (euro 1,153 per person) compared to standard clinical care. However, the screening approach was associated with an incremental gain in life years (0.06 per person) and QALYs (0.04 per person). Thus, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was euro 19,302 per life year saved and euro 30,291 per QALY. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis with 10,000 draws resulted in average ICERs of euro 22,118 per life year and euro 34,841 per QALY.

20424,Cost-effectiveness analysis of lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a combination treatment for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination for the treatment of CF homozygous for F508del CF Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) mutation. METHODS: A Markov-state transition model following a cohort of 12 year-old CF patients homozygous for F508del CFTR mutation in the United States (US) over two, four, six, eight and ten years from a payer''s perspective was developed using TreeAge Pro 2016. Markov states included: mild (percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s or FEV1 > 70%), moderate (FEV1 40-70%), severe (FEV1 < 40%) disease, post-transplant, and death. Pulmonary exacerbation and lung transplant were included as transition states. All the input parameters were estimated from the literature. A 1-year cycle length and 3% discount rate were applied. To assess uncertainty in long-term treatment effects, several scenarios were modelled: 100% long-term effectiveness (base-case), defined as improvement in FEV1 in the first year followed by no annual FEV1 decline and a constant reduction in pulmonary exacerbations throughout, 75%, 50%, 25% and 0% (worst case) long-term effectiveness, where treatment effects were intermediate from the second year of treatment until the end of the time horizon. Other scenarios included changing the starting age of the cohort to 6 and 25 years. Primary outcome included incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to determine uncertainty. RESULTS: Under the base-case, Lumacaftor/ivacaftor resulted in higher QALYs (7.29 vs 6.84) but at a very high cost ($1,778,920.88) compared to usual care ($116,155.76) over a 10-year period. The ICER for base-case and worst-case scenarios were $3,655,352 / QALY, and $8,480,265/QALY gained, respectively. In the base-case, lumacaftor/ivacaftor was cost-effective at a threshold of $150,000/QALY-gained when annual drug costs were lower than $4153. The results were not substantially affected by the sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention produces large QALY gains but at an extremely high cost, resulting in an ICER that would not typically be covered by any insurer.

Ranolazine has been shown to reduce angina frequency versus placebo in patients with T2D and stable angina. We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ranolazine when added to standard-of-care (SoC) versus SoC alone in patients with T2D and stable, but symptomatic coronary disease despite treatment with 1-2 antianginals. METHODS: A Markov model was developed and evaluated using cohort simulation. The model utilized a US societal perspective, 1-monthcycle length and 1-year time horizon and was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ranolazine versus SoC. Patients entered the model in 1 of 4 angina frequency health states based on baseline Seattle Angina Questionnaire Angina Frequency scores (100=no; 61-99=monthly; 31-60=weekly; 0-30=daily) and could transition between health states (first cycle only) or to death (any cycle) based on probabilities derived from the Type 2 Diabetes Evaluation of Ranolazine in Subjects with Chronic Stable Angina trial. RESULTS: Our model estimated patients treated with ranolazine lived a mean of 0.728 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of $16,654. Those not receiving ranolazine lived a mean of 0.702 QALYs and incurred costs of $15,476. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the addition of ranolazine to SoC was $45,308/QALY. Short Form-36 data suggest improvements in patients'' bodily pain drove the gain in QALYs associated with ranolazine (2.73 versus 3.96, p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Our model suggests the addition of ranolazine to SoC is likely cost-effective from a US societal perspective for the treatment of patients with T2D and stable, symptomatic coronary disease despite treatment with 1-2 antianginals.",2018-01-28870,30266352,Int J Cardiol,Elaine Nguyen,2018,273 /,34-38,No,30266352,"Elaine Nguyen; Craig I Coleman; Christine G Kohn; Erin R Weeda; Ranolazine in patients with type 2 diabetes and chronic angina: A cost-effectiveness analysis and assessment of health-related quality-of-life, Int J Cardiol, 2018 Dec 15; 273():0167-5273; 34-38",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Ranolazine vs. None,Chronic Angina,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,45308,United States,2016,48857.78

METHODS: We constructed a state-transition Markov model to compare the cost utility of THA and NM in the 6 BMI groups over a 15-year period. Model parameters for transition probability (risk of revision, re-revision, and death), utility, and costs (inflation adjusted to 2017 US dollars) were estimated from the literature. Direct medical costs of managing hip arthritis were accounted in the model. Indirect societal costs were not included. A 3% annual discount rate was used for costs and utilities. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of THA vs NM. One-way and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses of the model parameters were performed to determine the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Over the 15-year time period, the ICERs for THA vs NM were the following: normal weight ($6043/QALYs [quality-adjusted life years]), overweight ($5770/QALYs), obese ($5425/QALYs), severely obese ($7382/QALYs), morbidly obese ($8338/QALYs), and super obese ($16,651/QALYs).

20431,"Cost-Effectiveness of Total Hip Arthroplasty Versus Nonoperative Management in Normal, Overweight, Obese, Severely Obese, Morbidly Obese, and Super Obese Patients: A Markov Model","BACKGROUND: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of performing total hip arthroplasty (THA) vs nonoperative management (NM) among 6 body mass index (BMI) cohorts. METHODS: We constructed a state-transition Markov model to compare the cost utility of THA and NM in the 6 BMI groups over a 15-year period. Model parameters for transition probability (risk of revision, re-revision, and death), utility, and costs (inflation adjusted to 2017 US dollars) were estimated from the literature. Direct medical costs of managing hip arthritis were accounted in the model. Indirect societal costs were not included. A 3% annual discount rate was used for costs and utilities. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of THA vs NM. One-way and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses of the model parameters were performed to determine the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Over the 15-year time period, the ICERs for THA vs NM were the following: normal weight ($6043/QALYs [quality-adjusted life years]), overweight ($5770/QALYs), obese ($5425/QALYs), severely obese ($7382/QALYs), morbidly obese ($8338/QALYs), and super obese ($16,651/QALYs). The 2 highest BMI groups had higher incremental QALYs and incremental costs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that THA would be cost-effective in 100% of the normal, overweight, obese, severely obese, and morbidly obese simulations, and 99.95% of super obese simulations at an ICER threshold of $50,000/QALYs.

20432,Congenital heart defect repair with ADAPT tissue engineered pericardium scaffold: An early-stage health economic model,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of tissue engineered bovine tissue pericardium scaffold (CardioCel) for the repair of congenital heart defects in comparison with surgery using xenogeneic, autologous, and synthetic patches over a 40-year time horizon from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: A six-state Markov state-transition model to model natural history of disease and difference in the interventional effect of surgeries depending on patch type implanted. Patches differed regarding their probability of re-operation due to patch calcification, based on a systematic literature review. Transition probabilities were based on the published literature, other clinical inputs were based on UK registry data, and cost data were based on UK sources and the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was determined as incremental costs per quality adjusted life years (QALY) gained. We used a 40-year analytic time-horizon and adopted the payer perspective. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: According to the model predictions, CardioCel was associated with reduced incidence of re-operation, increased QALY, and costs savings compared to all other patches. Cost savings were greatest compared to synthetic patches. Estimated cost savings associated with CardioCel were greatest within atrioventricular septal defect repair and lowest for ventricular septal defect repair. Based on our model, CardioCel relative risk for re-operations is 0.938, 0.956and 0.902 relative to xenogeneic, autologous, and synthetic patches, respectively.

20435,Cost-effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel for adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma in the United States,"PURPOSE: Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) was recently approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) following two or more prior therapies. As the first CAR T-cell therapy available for adults in the US, there are important questions about clinical and economic value. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of axi-cel compared to salvage chemotherapy using a decision model and a US payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model was developed to estimate life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime cost for adult patients with R/R LBCL treated with axi-cel vs salvage chemotherapy (R-DHAP). Patient-level analyses of the ZUMA-1 and SCHOLAR-1 studies were used to inform the model and to estimate the proportion achieving long-term survival. Drug and procedure costs were derived from US average sales prices and Medicare reimbursement schedules. Future healthcare costs in long-term remission was derived from per capita Medicare spending. Utility values were derived from patient-level data from ZUMA-1 and external literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. Outcomes were calculated over a lifetime horizon and were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: In the base case, LYs, QALYs, and lifetime costs were 9.5, 7.7, and $552,921 for axi-cel vs 2.6, 1.1, and $172,737 for salvage chemotherapy, respectively. The axi-cel cost per QALY gained was $58,146. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the fraction achieving long-term remission, discount rate, and axi-cel price. The likelihood that axi-cel is cost-effective was 95% at a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Axi-cel is a potentially cost-effective alternative to salvage chemotherapy for adults with R/R LBCL.

20436,Economic benefits of microprocessor controlled prosthetic knees: a modeling study,"BACKGROUND: Advanced prosthetic knees allow for more dynamic movements and improved quality of life, but payers have recently started questioning their value. To answer this question, the differential clinical outcomes and cost of microprocessor-controlled knees (MPK) compared to non-microprocessor controlled knees (NMPK) were assessed. METHODS: We conducted a literature review of the clinical and economic impacts of prosthetic knees, convened technical expert panel meetings, and implemented a simulation model over a 10-year time period for unilateral transfemoral Medicare amputees with a Medicare Functional Classification Level of 3 and 4 using estimates from the published literature and expert input. The results are summarized as an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) from a societal perspective, i.e., the incremental cost of MPK compared to NMPK for each quality-adjusted life-year gained. All costs were adjusted to 2016 U.S. dollars and discounted using a 3% rate to the present time. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that compared to NMPK over a 10-year time period: for every 100 persons, MPK results in 82 fewer major injurious falls, 62 fewer minor injurious falls, 16 fewer incidences of osteoarthritis, and 11 lives saved; on a per person per year basis, MPK reduces direct healthcare cost by $3676 and indirect cost by $909, but increases device acquisition and repair cost by $6287 and total cost by $1702; on a per person basis, MPK is associated with an incremental total cost of $10,604 and increases the number of life years by 0.11 and quality adjusted life years by 0.91. MPK has an ICER ratio of $11,606 per quality adjusted life year, and the economic benefits of MPK are robust in various sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced prosthetics for transfemoral amputees, specifically MPKs, are associated with improved clinical benefits compared to non-MPKs.

20437,Cost Effectiveness of Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccines Compared with Trivalent Influenza Vaccines in Young Children and Older Adults in Korea,"INTRODUCTION: Trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) are currently reimbursed for subjects aged >/= 65 years and children between 6 and 59 months of age under a national immunization program in South Korea. Quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs) are expected to address the potential problem of influenza B-lineage mismatch for TIVs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to compare the cost effectiveness of QIV versus TIV in children aged 6-59 months and older adults >/= 65 years of age in South Korea. METHODS: A 1-year static population model was employed to compare the costs and outcomes of a QIV vaccination program compared with TIV in children aged 6-59 months and older adults >/= 65 years of age in South Korea. Influenza-related parameters (probabilities, health resource use, and costs) were derived from an analysis of the National Health Insurance System claims database between 2010 and 2013 under a broad and narrow set of International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes used to identify influenza. Other inputs were extracted from published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2016 South Korean Won [KRW] per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) were estimated using a ''limited'' societal perspective as per the Korean pharmacoeconomic guidelines. QALYs lost due to premature mortality were discounted at 5% annually. RESULTS: For both age groups combined, under the narrow definition of influenza, QIV is expected to prevent nearly 16,000 (2923 in children and 13,011 in older adults) medically attended influenza cases, nearly 8000 (672 in children, 7048 in older adults) cases of complications, and over 230 (0 in children, 238 in older adults) deaths annually compared with TIV. The impact of using QIV versus TIV in this setting translates into savings of KRW 24 billion (KRW 0.6 billion in children, KRW 23.4 billion in older adults) in annual medical costs, and over 2100 (18 in children, 2084 in older adults) QALYs. Under the broad definition, the corresponding results are over 190,000 (50,697 in children, 140,644 in older adults) influenza cases, over 37,000 (12,623 in children, 24,526 in older adults) complications, 270 deaths (0 in children, 270 in older adults), KRW 94.22 billion (KRW 16 billion in children, KRW 78.2 billion in older adults), and over 3500 QALYs saved (316 in children, 3260 in older adults).

The impact of using QIV versus TIV in this setting translates into savings of KRW 24 billion (KRW 0.6 billion in children, KRW 23.4 billion in older adults) in annual medical costs, and over 2100 (18 in children, 2084 in older adults) QALYs. Under the broad definition, the corresponding results are over 190,000 (50,697 in children, 140,644 in older adults) influenza cases, over 37,000 (12,623 in children, 24,526 in older adults) complications, 270 deaths (0 in children, 270 in older adults), KRW 94.22 billion (KRW 16 billion in children, KRW 78.2 billion in older adults), and over 3500 QALYs saved (316 in children, 3260 in older adults). CONCLUSION: The use of QIV over TIV was estimated to not be cost effective in children 6-59 months of age, but cost saving in older adults, using the narrow definition of influenza; however, QIV use was cost saving in both age groups using the broad definition. QIV is expected to yield more benefits in older adults >/= 65 years of age than in children aged 6-59 months due to higher influenza-related mortality and costs among the older adults.

20441,Comparison between low-dose chemotherapy and surgery for the treatment of extremity-associated solitary bone lesions in children with Langerhans cell histiocytosis in South China: A case-control study,"Background: The treatment algorithm for solitary bone lesions of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (SBL-LCH) in children extremities still remains controversial. We conducted a retrospective case-control study to compare the feasibility of low-dose chemotherapy (LDC) and surgery for SBL-LCH in children extremities. Patients and methods: This study compares 43 pediatric patients starting LDC with a surgery control group (n=44), matched for gender, age, follow-up time, and lesion sites and sizes, treated between 2001 and 2015 at our institution. Hospital stay (HS), time to symptom relief (TTSR), recovery time (RT), complications, relapse-free survival (RFS), health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and cost-effectiveness were analyzed for each strategy. Results: HS, TTSR and RT in the LDC group were shorter than those in the surgery group (p<0.01). Chemotherapy-related complications included nausea (16.30%), aminotransferase elevation (9.30%), slight hair loss (11.63%), decline in immune function (23.26%), growth retardation (16.30%), and moon face (9.30%). Chemotherapy-related side effects were mild and well tolerated. Pathologic fractures (6.81%), loosening of instrumentation (6.00%,), surgical site infection (4.00%) and rejection of bone grafting (9.09%) developed in surgery patients. LDC treatment resulted in a longer RFS (87 months) than surgery alone (59 months) (p=0.011). Furthermore, compared with surgery patients, patients in the LDC group had a better HRQOL at 3 months'' follow-up for the physical, role, emotional and social function domains assessed (p<0.001, p=0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.003, respectively) according to the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30(R) survey. However, HRQOL scores at 2 years'' follow-up were similar between the two groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was yen-137,030/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for LDC versus surgery. Conclusions: Compared with surgery, LDC promotes more rapid recovery, is less invasive, is characterized by increased safety and a superior HRQOL, and is a more cost-effective treatment strategy for pediatric patients with SBL-LCH in the extremities.",2018-01-28937,30237968,J Bone Oncol,Hongyi Li,2018,12 /,1-6,No,30237968,"Hongyi Li; Xianbiao Xie; Junqiang Yin; Jian Tu; Xiaoshuai Wang; Weihai Liu; Jiajun Zhang; Hongbo Li; Changye Zou; Yongqian Wang; Jingnan Shen; Gang Huang; Comparison between low-dose chemotherapy and surgery for the treatment of extremity-associated solitary bone lesions in children with Langerhans cell histiocytosis in South China: A case-control study, J Bone Oncol, 2018 Sep; 12():2212-1366; 1-6",QALY,China,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",Low Dose Chemotherapy for Solitary Bone Lesions vs. Surgery for Solitary Bone Lesions,Not Stated,16 Years,0 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-137030,China,2016,-22253.85
20442,Pegylated versus non-pegylated interferon beta 1a in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"Background: Pegylated (PEG) interferon beta 1a has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) as an alternative to interferon beta 1a for multiple sclerosis (MS). Due to its higher price, this study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PEG-interferon beta 1-a compared with interferon beta 1a from an Iranian payer perspective. Methods: A Markov model was designed according to health states based on Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and one-month cycles over a 10-year time horizon. Direct medical and non-medical costs were included from a payer perspective. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated around 11111 US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for the PEG-interferon versus interferon regimen [with currency rate of 29,000 Iranian Rial (IRR) to 1 USD in 2016].

The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of standard-dose PPI medications in the initial non-eradication treatment of DU. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Clinicaltrials.gov, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP database, and the Wanfang database from their earliest records to September 2017. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating omeprazole (20 mg/day), pantoprazole (40 mg/day), lansoprazole (30 mg/day), rabeprazole (20 mg/day), ilaprazole (10 mg/day), ranitidine (300 mg/day), famotidine (40 mg/day), or placebo for DU were included. The outcomes were 4-week ulcer healing rate (4-UHR) and the incidence of adverse events (AEs). A network meta-analysis (NMA) using a Bayesian random effects model was conducted, and a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision tree was performed from the payer''s perspective over 1 year. Results: A total of 62 RCTs involving 10,339 participants (eight interventions) were included.

20447,Choice of Prosthetic Implant Combinations in Total Hip Replacement: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Using UK and Swedish Hip Joint Registries Data,"BACKGROUND: Prosthetic implants used in total hip replacements (THR) have a range of bearing surface combinations (metal-on-polyethylene, ceramic-on-polyethylene, ceramic-on-ceramic, and metal-on-metal), head sizes (small [<36 mm in diameter] and large [>/=36 mm in diameter]), and fixation techniques (cemented, uncemented, hybrid, and reverse hybrid). These can influence prosthesis survival, patients'' quality of life, and healthcare costs. OBJECTIVES: To compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of implants for patients of different age and sex profiles. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of various implants against small-head cemented metal-on-polyethylene implants.

OBJECTIVES: To compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of implants for patients of different age and sex profiles. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of various implants against small-head cemented metal-on-polyethylene implants.

20467,Cost-Effectiveness of Reclassifying Triptans in Australia: Application of an Economic Evaluation Approach to Regulatory Decisions,"BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common, chronic, disabling headache disorder. Triptans, used as an acute treatment for migraine, are available via prescription in Australia. An Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) committee rejected reclassifying sumatriptan and zolmitriptan from prescription medicine to pharmacist-only between 2005 and 2009, largely on the basis of concerns about patient risk. Nevertheless, pharmacist-only triptans may reduce migraine duration and free up healthcare resources. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of reclassifying triptans from prescription-only to pharmacist-only in Australia. METHODS: The study design included decision-analytic modeling combining data from various sources. Behavior before and after reclassification was estimated using medical practitioner and patient surveys and also administrative data. Health outcomes included migraine frequency and duration as well as adverse events (AEs) discussed by the TGA committee. Efficacy and AEs were estimated using randomized controlled trials and observational studies. RESULTS: Reclassifying triptans will reduce migraine duration but increase AEs. This will result in 337 quality-adjusted life-years gained at an increased cost of A$5.9 million over 10 years for all Australian adults older than 15 years (19.6 million). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be A$17 412/quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is likely to be considered cost-effective by Australian decision makers. Serotonin syndrome, a key concern of the TGA committee, had little impact on the results. Further research is needed regarding pharmacist-only triptan use by migraineurs currently using over-the-counter medicines and by nonmigraineurs, the efficacy of triptans, and the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular AEs and chronic headaches with triptans.",2019-01-28041,30832967,Value Health,Bonny Parkinson,2019,22 / 3,293-302,Yes,30832967,"Bonny Parkinson; Mutsa Gumbie; Henry Cutler; Natalie Gauld; Virginia Mumford; Philip Haywood; Cost-Effectiveness of Reclassifying Triptans in Australia: Application of an Economic Evaluation Approach to Regulatory Decisions, Value Health, 2019 Mar; 22(3):1098-3015; 293-302",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical",Triptans (re-classified as pharmacist only) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Triptans (classified as prescription only),Not Stated,Not Stated,15 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,17412,Australia,2016,13963.18
20468,Cost-utility analysis of colonoscopy or faecal immunochemical test for population-based organised colorectal cancer screening,"Background: Organised programmes for colorectal cancer screening demand a high burden of medical and economic resources. The preferred methods are the faecal immunochemical test and primary colonoscopy. Objective: The purpose of this study was to perform an economic analysis and comparison between these tests in Europe. Methods: We used a Markov cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective comparing biennial faecal immunochemical test or colonoscopy every 10 years screening versus non-screening in Portugal. The population was screened, aged from 50-74 years, and efficacy was evaluated in quality-adjusted life years. For the base-case scenario, the faecal immunochemical test cost was euro3 with 50% acceptance and colonoscopy cost was euro397 with 38% acceptance. The threshold was set at euro39,760/quality-adjusted life years and the primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: Screening by biennial faecal immunochemical test and primary colonoscopy every 10 years resulted in incremental utilities of 0.00151 quality-adjusted life years and 0.00185 quality-adjusted life years at additional costs of euro4 and euro191, respectively. The faecal immunochemical test was the most cost-effective option providing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro2694/quality-adjusted life years versus euro103,633/quality-adjusted life years for colonoscopy.

20472,Cost effectiveness analysis of HPV primary screening and dual stain cytology triage compared with cervical cytology,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) primary screening triage with p16/Ki-67 dual stain cytology compared to cytology. METHODS: We conducted an Excel(R)-based budget impact model to estimate the preinvasive and invasive cervical cancer cases identified, mortality rate, direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of two strategies from the healthcare payer perspective. The study population is a cohort of women 30-65 years of age presenting for cervical screening. RESULTS: HPV primary screening triage with p16/Ki-67 dual stain showed higher sensitivity without losing specificity compared to conventional Pap smear. The improving the screening performance leads to decrease the prevalence of precancerous lesion, annual incidence and mortality of cervical cancer. The incidence of cervical cancer case detected by new algorithm compared with conventional method were 31,607 and 38,927, respectively. In addition, the new algorithm was more effective and more costly (average QALY 24.03, annual cost $13,262,693) than conventional cytology (average QALY 23.98, annual cost $7,713,251). The incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER) per QALY gained was $1,395. The sensitivity analysis showed if the cost of cytology and HPV test increased three times, the ICER would fall to $303/QALY gained and increased to $4,970/QALY gained, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our model results suggest that screening by use of HPV genotyping test as a primary screening test combined with dual stain cytology as the triage of HPV positive women in Thai population 30-65 years old is expected to be more cost-effective than conventional Pap cytology.",2019-01-28049,30740950,J Gynecol Oncol,Wichai Termrungruanglert,2019,30 / 2,e17,No,30740950,"Wichai Termrungruanglert; Nipon Khemapech; Tanitra Tantitamit; Piyalamporn Havanond; Cost effectiveness analysis of HPV primary screening and dual stain cytology triage compared with cervical cytology, J Gynecol Oncol, 2019 Mar; 30(2):2005-0380; e17",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Screening,HPV screening triage with dual stain cytology vs. Cervical cytology screening,Not Stated,65 Years,30 Years,Female,Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,11098880000,United States,2018,11439395284.4
20473,The Cost-Effectiveness of Financial Incentives for Viral Suppression: HPTN 065 Study,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of financial incentives for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral suppression compared to standard of care. STUDY DESIGN: Mathematical model of 2-year intervention offering financial incentives ($70 quarterly) for viral suppression (<400 copies/ml(3)) based on the HPTN 065 clinical trial with HIV patients in the Bronx, NY and Washington, D.C. METHODS: A disease progression model with HIV transmission risk equations was developed following guidelines from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. We used health care sector and societal perspectives, 3% discount rate, and lifetime horizon. Data sources included trial data (baseline N = 16,208 patients), CDC HIV Surveillance data, and published literature. Outcomes were costs (2017 USD), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), HIV infections prevented, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Financial incentives for viral suppression were estimated to be cost-saving from a societal perspective and cost-effective ($49,877/QALY) from a health care sector perspective. Compared to the standard of care, financial incentives gain 0.06 QALYs and lower discounted lifetime costs by $4210 per patient. The model estimates that incentivized patients transmit 9% fewer infections than the standard-of-care patients. In the sensitivity analysis, ICER 95% credible intervals ranged from cost-saving to $501,610/QALY with 72% of simulations being cost-effective using a $150,000/QALY threshold. Modeling results are limited by uncertainty in efficacy from the clinical trial.

20474,The Cost-Effectiveness of Financial Incentives for Viral Suppression: HPTN 065 Study,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of financial incentives for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral suppression compared to standard of care. STUDY DESIGN: Mathematical model of 2-year intervention offering financial incentives ($70 quarterly) for viral suppression (<400 copies/ml(3)) based on the HPTN 065 clinical trial with HIV patients in the Bronx, NY and Washington, D.C. METHODS: A disease progression model with HIV transmission risk equations was developed following guidelines from the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. We used health care sector and societal perspectives, 3% discount rate, and lifetime horizon. Data sources included trial data (baseline N = 16,208 patients), CDC HIV Surveillance data, and published literature.

20475,Assessing the Cost-Effectiveness of Updated Breast Cancer Screening Guidelines for Average-Risk Women,"BACKGROUND: Several specialty societies have recently updated their breast cancer screening guidelines in late 2015/early 2016. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of US-based mammography screening guidelines. METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model to generate the natural history of invasive breast cancer and capture how screening and treatment modified the natural course of the disease. We used the model to assess the cost-effectiveness of screening strategies, including annual screening starting at the age of 40 years, biennial screening starting at the age of 50 years, and a hybrid strategy that begins screening at the age of 45 years and transitions to biennial screening at the age of 55 years, combined with three cessation ages: 75 years, 80 years, and no upper age limit. Findings were summarized as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) and cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier. RESULTS: The screening strategy that starts annual mammography at the age of 45 years and switches to biennial screening between the ages of 55 and 75 years was the most cost-effective, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40,135/QALY. Probabilistic analysis showed that the hybrid strategy had the highest probability of being optimal when the societal willingness to pay was between $44,000/QALY and $103,500/QALY. Within the range of commonly accepted societal willingness to pay, no optimal strategy involved screening with a cessation age of 80 years or older.

STUDY DESIGN: Markov model with annual periods from payer perspective. METHODS: The modeled population represented pooled patients from the CARE-MS I and II trials. Therapies'' comparative efficacy at reducing relapses and slowing disability worsening was obtained from network meta-analyses. Safety information was extracted from package inserts. Withdrawal rates, treatment waning, resource use, cost, and utility inputs were derived from published studies and clinical expert opinion. To project the natural history of disease worsening, data from the British Columbia cohort was used. RESULTS: Alemtuzumab dominated comparators by accumulating higher total quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (8.977) and lower total costs ($421 996) compared with fingolimod (7.955; $1 085 814), natalizumab (8.456; $1 048 599), ocrelizumab (8.478; $908 365), and generic glatiramer acetate (7.845; $895 661) over a 20-year time horizon. Alemtuzumab''s dominance was primarily driven by savings in treatment costs because alemtuzumab has long-term duration of response and is initially administered as 2 annual courses, with 36.1% of patients requiring retreatment over 5 years, whereas comparators are used chronically.

We modeled the cost-utility of VN compared with standard of care (SoC). STUDY DESIGN: A 2-state Markov model, alive and dead, with a lifetime horizon. METHODS: Visual acuity (VA) and visual field (VF) were tracked to model quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). VN led to an improvement in VA and VF that we assumed was maintained for 10 years followed by a 10-year waning period. The cost of VN was $850 000, and other direct medical costs for depression and trauma were included for a US healthcare system perspective. A modified societal perspective also included direct nonmedical costs and indirect costs. RESULTS: VN provided an additional 1.3 QALYs over the remaining lifetime of an individual. The average total lifetime direct medical cost for individuals treated with VN was $1 039 000 compared with $213 400 for SoC, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $643 800/QALY from the US healthcare system perspective. Direct nonmedical costs totalled $1 070 900 for VN and $1 203 300 for SoC, and indirect costs totalled $405 400 for VN and $482 900 for SoC, leading to an ICER of $480 100/QALY from the modified societal perspective.

20485,Interventions and Innovation to Prevent Surgical Site Infection in Colorectal Surgery: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Surgical site infection (SSI), particularly in colorectal surgery, continues to cause substantial morbidity and cost. Both process- and product-based interventions have been proposed and implemented. No cost-effectiveness analysis of such interventions has been published. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study used a decision-analytic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of strategies for the prevention of SSI. Costs, utilities, and transition probabilities were obtained from literature review. We used a lifetime time horizon, captured with explicit event modeling for a year plus quantification of enduring health outcomes. We represented costs in 2017 US dollars and health effects in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Both process- and device-based strategies were dominant-clinically superior and also less expensive-compared with no intervention. Two types of double-ring wound protection barrier devices with greater anticontamination functionality were found to be both clinically superior and cost-saving compared with bundled process measures and simpler single-ring devices. Gains in QALYs were 230 per 1000 patients, and cost savings were 2.2 million dollars per 1000 patients, driven primarily by the high cost of SSI. CONCLUSIONS: We found process-based interventions and wound protection devices to be superior to no intervention in the prevention of SSI. Double ring devices offered a distinct advantage over simpler devices, with small reductions in SSI risk leading to substantial cost savings.

However, the economic impact is unclear yet in China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate 1-month patient transitions in a 10-year time horizon from Chinese heath care system perspective. The health and economic outcomes of four first-line strategies (pemetrexed plus cisplatin [PC], gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) among NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations were estimated and assessed via indirect comparisons. Costs in the Chinese setting were estimated by using local hospital data and literatures. A 5% annual discount rate was applied to both costs and outcomes. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Afatinib achieved additional 0.382, 0.216 and 0.174 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with marginal $7930, $3680 and $2818 costs in comparison with PC, gefitinib and erlotinib, which resulted in the ICERs of $20,758, $17,693 and $16,197 per QALY gained, respectively.

This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus SoC platinum-based chemotherapy from the French healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A three-state partitioned-survival model was adapted to project outcomes and costs of squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients respectively, over a 10-year time horizon. Clinical and utility data were collected from the trial. A network meta-analysis was performed to consider platinum-based triplets also used for non-squamous NSCLC. Direct medical costs were considered based on ressources identified from the trial and literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4% per year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as cost per Life Year (LY) and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: For squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.93 LY (11 months), and 0.74 QALY (9 months) for an incremental cost of euro62,032 compared with platinum-based doublets. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based doublets was euro66,825/LY and euro84,097/QALY. For non-squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.85-1.32 LYs (10.2-15.8 months) and 0.64-1.02 QALYs (7.7-12.2 months) for an incremental cost varying from euro-14,947-+47,064 depending on the specific comparator. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was euro62,846/LY and euro78,729/QALY; regimens including pemetrexed were dominated.

Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated as cost per Life Year (LY) and cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: For squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.93 LY (11 months), and 0.74 QALY (9 months) for an incremental cost of euro62,032 compared with platinum-based doublets. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based doublets was euro66,825/LY and euro84,097/QALY. For non-squamous NSCLC, pembrolizumab was projected to increase life expectancy of patients by 0.85-1.32 LYs (10.2-15.8 months) and 0.64-1.02 QALYs (7.7-12.2 months) for an incremental cost varying from euro-14,947-+47,064 depending on the specific comparator. The ICER of pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab was euro62,846/LY and euro78,729/QALY; regimens including pemetrexed were dominated. Results were most sensitive to extrapolations of survival outcomes and assumptions for continued effectiveness and treatment duration of pembrolizumab.

20496,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pembrolizumab versus standard-of-care chemotherapy for first-line treatment of PD-L1 positive (>50%) metastatic squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer in France,"INTRODUCTION: In the KEYNOTE-024 trial, pembrolizumab demonstrated significant improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) versus Standard-of-Care (SoC) platinum-based doublets for first-line treatment of PD-L1 -positive (>/=50%) metastatic Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients with no EGFR mutations or ALK translocations. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab versus SoC platinum-based chemotherapy from the French healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A three-state partitioned-survival model was adapted to project outcomes and costs of squamous and non-squamous NSCLC patients respectively, over a 10-year time horizon. Clinical and utility data were collected from the trial. A network meta-analysis was performed to consider platinum-based triplets also used for non-squamous NSCLC. Direct medical costs were considered based on ressources identified from the trial and literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 4% per year.

20497,Cost Effectiveness of Meningococcal Serogroup B Vaccination in College-Aged Young Adults,"INTRODUCTION: Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B is the most common form of meningococcal infection in young adults in the U.S. Vaccines have recently become available, but it is not clear that the benefits outweigh the costs. The purpose of this study was to assess cost effectiveness and determine potentially favorable conditions for universal vaccination. METHODS: Costs and benefits of universal vaccination at college entry versus no universal vaccination with an outbreak response were estimated in 2018 in the context of a mid-sized U.S.-based 4-year college from both a health sector and a societal perspective. Probability, cost, and utility data were obtained from the published literature. Costs (2015 U.S.$) and benefits were discounted at 3%. One-way and multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed including variations in the specific vaccine used. Further testing of the model''s parameters at extremes was used to identify favorable conditions for universal vaccination. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained with universal vaccination was $13.9 million under the health sector perspective and $13.8 million under the societal perspective, each perspective was compared with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Multivariable probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that universal vaccination was not the preferred strategy for <$15 million per quality-adjusted life year. Under an extremely favorable model, a universal vaccination strategy became cost effective for vaccine series costing <$65.

20499,Cost-Effectiveness of a US National Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax With a Multistakeholder Approach: Who Pays and Who Benefits,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the health impact and cost-effectiveness of a national penny-per-ounce sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax, overall and with stratified costs and benefits for 9 distinct stakeholder groups. METHODS: We used a validated microsimulation model (CVD PREDICT) to estimate cardiovascular disease reductions, quality-adjusted life years gained, and cost-effectiveness for US adults aged 35 to 85 years, evaluating full and partial consumer price pass-through. RESULTS: From health care and societal perspectives, the SSB tax was highly cost-saving. When we evaluated health gains, taxes paid, and out-of-pocket health care savings for 6 distinct consumer categories, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $20 247 to $42 662 per quality-adjusted life year for 100% price pass-through (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios similar with 50% pass-through). For the beverage industry, net costs were $0.92 billion with 100% pass-through (largely tax-implementation costs) and $49.75 billion with 50% pass-through (largely because of partial industry coverage of the tax). For government, the SSB tax positively affected both tax revenues and health care cost savings.
