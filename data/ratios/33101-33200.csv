33101,Cost-Effectiveness of Pediatric Influenza Vaccination in The Netherlands,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of extending the Dutch influenza vaccination program for elderly and medical high-risk groups to include pediatric influenza vaccination, taking indirect protection into account. METHODS: An age-structured dynamic transmission model was used that was calibrated to influenza-associated GP visits over 4 seasons (2010-2011 to 2013-2014). The clinical and economic impact of different pediatric vaccination strategies were compared over 20 years, varying the targeted age range, the vaccine type for children or elderly and high-risk groups. Outcome measures include averted symptomatic infections and deaths, societal costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 4% and 1.5% annually. RESULTS: At an assumed coverage of 50%, adding pediatric vaccination for 2- to 17-year-olds with quadrivalent live-attenuated vaccine to the current vaccination program for elderly and medical high-groups with quadrivalent inactivated vaccine was estimated to avert, on average, 401 820 symptomatic cases and 72 deaths per year. Approximately half of averted symptomatic cases and 99% of averted deaths were prevented in other age groups than 2- to 17-year-olds due to herd immunity. The cumulative discounted 20-year economic impact was 35 068 QALYs gained and €1687 million saved, that is, the intervention was cost-saving. This vaccination strategy had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy considered, dominating pediatric strategies targeting 2- to 6-year-olds or 2- to 12-year-olds or strategies with trivalent inactivated vaccine.

33111,Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of catch-up 9-valent HPV vaccination of individuals through age 45 years in the United States,"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended catch-up 9-valent Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination through age 26 years, and shared clinical decision-making for adults aged 27-45 years, compared with catch-up through age 26 years and 21 years for females and males, respectively (status quo; pre-June-2019 recommendations). This study assessed the public health impact and cost-effectiveness of expanded catch-up vaccination through age 45 years (expanded catch-up) compared with status quo. We used an HPV dynamic transmission infection and disease model to assess disease outcomes and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of expanded catch-up compared with status quo. Costs (2018 USD), calculated from a healthcare sector perspective, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were discounted at 3% annually. Historical vaccination coverage was estimated using NIS-TEEN survey data (NHANES data for sensitivity analysis). Alternative scenario analyses included restricting upper age of expanded catch-up through 26 years (June-2019 ACIP recommendation), 29 years, and further 5-year increments. Our results show expanded catch-up vaccination would prevent additional 37,856 cancers, 314,468 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia-2/3s, 1,743,461 genital warts, and 10,698 deaths compared with status quo over 100 years at cost of $141,000/QALY. With NHANES coverage, the ICER was $96,000/QALY. The June-2019 ACIP recommendation also provided public health benefits with an ICER of $117,000/QALY, compared with status quo. The ICER for expanded vaccination through age 34 years was $107,000/QALY. Expanding catch-up vaccination program through age 45 years-old in the US is expected to provide public health benefits, and cost-effectiveness improves with expanding catch-up through age 34.",2021-01-34737,33427033,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Vincent Daniels,2021,/,1-9,No,33427033,"Vincent Daniels; Vimalanand S Prabhu; Cody Palmer; Salome Samant; Smita Kothari; Craig Roberts; Elamin Elbasha; Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of catch-up 9-valent HPV vaccination of individuals through age 45 years in the United States, Hum Vaccin Immunother , 2021 Feb 25; ():2164-554X; 1-9",QALY,United States of America,"Bacterial, viral and other infectious agents","Immunization, Screening",human papillomavirus vaccination (9-valent) and cervical screening vs. human papillomavirus vaccination (9-valent) and cervical screening (11-26 year olds),Not Stated,45 Years,9 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,141000,United States,2018,152153.34
33112,Cost-utility analysis of emicizumab prophylaxis in haemophilia A patients with factor VIII inhibitors in Korea,"AIMS: Haemophilia A patients with factor VIII inhibitors (HAPI) experience frequent spontaneous bleeding, approximately once a week, and require expensive bypassing agent (BPA) treatments to control bleeding over their lifetime. According to the HAVEN 1 trial, weekly emicizumab (Hemlibra®) prophylaxis injection reduces annualized bleeding rates (ABR) by 87% compared with BPA on-demand treatment (BPA-OD) administered at the time of bleeding. Our study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of emicizumab prophylaxis in HAPI in Korea. METHODS: Using a lifetime Markov model with health states of ''alive with bleeds'' and ''dead'', we simulated the experience of HAPI receiving emicizumab prophylaxis (treatment arm) or BPA-OD (control arm) and estimated expected clinical and economic outcomes under each treatment arm. Model parameters included comparative effectiveness, clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of Korean HAPI, costs of drug treatment and medical events and utility for ''alive with bleeds'' state under each treatment. We utilized local data, including National Health Insurance claims data, national statistics, literature and expert surveys with haematologists. RESULTS: Base-case analysis results showed that compared with BPA-OD, lifetime emicizumab prophylaxis prevented 807 bleedings, extended 3.04 quality-adjusted life-years and reduced costs by 2.6 million US dollars.

33113,Retrospective Impact Analysis and Cost-Effectiveness of the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Infant Program in Australia,"Australia introduced the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPCV) on the universal infant National Immunisation Program (NIP) in 2005 and replaced it with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPCV) in 2011, both under a 3?+?0 schedule. The objective of this analysis was to quantify the clinical and economic impact of the universal infant PCV program in Australia from its introduction. A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the historical impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) programs in Australia from a direct health care perspective. Historical incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia, and otitis media (OM) were obtained from available Australian epidemiologic databases supplemented with published data. Costs were from Medicare Benefits Schedule in 2018 Australian dollars and utility weights from published sources. Historical observed changes in disease for the universal PCV NIP era (2005-2017) were compared against a ""no-vaccine"" scenario. The expected incidence for the no-vaccine scenario in years 2005-2017 was calculated using pre-universal PCV NIP era (2001-2004) data. Averted cases, deaths, incremental costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were obtained by subtracting the vaccine scenario totals from the no-vaccine scenario totals. From the inclusion in the universal infant NIP, 7vPCV and 13vPCV are estimated to have prevented 1,770,024 cases of pneumococcal disease (IPD?=?16,392; OM?=?1,575,491; pneumonia?=?102,059) and 1195 associated deaths. Over this period, there was a total 24,335 QALYs gained. Costs for the universal infant NIP were offset by $733 million direct costs saved, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $3347 per QALY gained. PCVs have provided substantial public health and economic value from sustained use in Australia. Results are conservative, since long-term pneumococcal disease consequences and broader socioeconomic benefits were not considered. Maintaining 13vPCV on the Australian infant NIP under the newly implemented 2?+?1 schedule will likely provide more return on investment and sustained reductions in pneumococcal disease.",2021-01-34753,33575966,Infect Dis Ther,Johnna Perdrizet,2021,10 / 1,507-520,No,33575966,"Johnna Perdrizet; Yuen S Lai; Scott Williams; Valda A Struwig; Matt Wasserman; Klaus Witte; Gerd Hasenfuss; Axel Kloppe; Daniel Burkhoff; Michelle Green; Joe Moss; Alison Peel; Stuart Mealing; Isabelle Durand Zaleski; Martin R Cowie; Retrospective Impact Analysis and Cost-Effectiveness of the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Infant Program in Australia, Infect Dis Ther, 2021 Mar; 10(1):2193-8229; 507-520",QALY,Australia,"Bacterial, viral and other infectious agents, Diseases of middle ear and mastoid",Immunization,universal infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7-valent and 13-valent) vs. do nothing,Not Stated,1 Years,Not Stated,"Male, Female",Full,13 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,3347,Australia,2018,2699.66

We aimed to compare the EGFR mutation-guided target therapy versus empirical chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in the public healthcare setting of Hong Kong. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to simulate outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of advanced (stage IIIB/IV) NSCLC adult patients with un-tested EGFR-sensitizing mutation status. Four treatment strategies were evaluated: Empirical first-line chemotherapy with cisplatin-pemetrexed (empirical chemotherapy group), and EGFR mutation-guided use of a TKI (afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib). Model outcome measures were direct medical cost, progression-free survival, overall survival, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost per QALY gained (ICER) was estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine robustness of model results. RESULTS: Empirical chemotherapy and EGFR mutation-guided gefitinib gained lower QALYs at higher costs than the erlotinib group. Comparing with EGFR mutation-guided erlotinib, the afatinib strategy gained additional QALYs with ICER (540,633 USD/QALY).

33128,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Rivaroxaban Plus Aspirin Compared with Aspirin Alone in Patients with Coronary and Peripheral Artery Diseases in Italy,"BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban is a selective inhibitor of coagulation factor Xa and its combination with aspirin showed better outcomes in the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular disease than aspirin alone. OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to economically compare the cost effectiveness of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) plus aspirin (100 mg once daily) with aspirin alone in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or peripheral artery disease (PAD) and related subgroups. METHODS: The analysis simulates the perspective of the Italian National Healthcare Service and used a state-transition decision Markov model. Clinical efficacy data and health events risks were gathered from the COMPASS trial. Health outcomes and costs (in Euros) were evaluated over a lifetime horizon and were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Direct healthcare costs entered the analysis. Results were expressed in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For the CAD or PAD population, rivaroxaban plus aspirin was more effective and costly compared with aspirin alone. Incremental costs and efficacy produced an ICER of €16,522 per QALY gained. Analyses found similar trends for the PAD and CAD groups, with respective ICERs of €8003 and €18,599, while ICERs for the other groups were lower than €13,000 per QALY.

33134,International cost-effectiveness analysis evaluating endoscopic screening for gastric cancer for populations with low and high risk,"BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer remains one of the 3 most common causes of cancer death worldwide. Understanding the health and economic factors that affect screening cost-effectiveness in different countries will help address when and where it makes most sense to screen for gastric cancer. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model to compare screening and surveillance strategies for gastric cancer in Brazil, France, Japan, Nigeria, and the United States. Primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We then performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how each variable affected the overall model. RESULTS: In all countries, the most cost-effective strategies, measured by incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to no screening, were screening every 10 years, surveillance of high- and low-risk patients every 5 and 10 years, respectively, and screening every 5 years.

The most important variables across different screening strategies and countries were starting age of screening, cost of endoscopy, and baseline probability of local gastric cancer at time of diagnosis.

33174,A preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis of lung protective ventilation with extra corporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO(2)R) in the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS),"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation (MV) is the cornerstone in the management of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Recent research suggests that decreasing the intensity of MV using lung protective ventilation (LPV) with lower tidal volume (Vt) and driving pressure (?P) could improve survival. Extra-corporal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) precisely enables LPV by allowing lower Vt, ?P and mechanical power while maintaining PaCO(2) within a physiologic range. This study evaluates the potential cost-effectiveness of ECCO(2)R-enabled LPV in France. METHODS: We modelled the distribution over time of ventilated ARDS patients across 3 health-states (alive & ventilated, alive & weaned from ventilation, dead). We compared the outcomes of 3 strategies: MV (no ECCO(2)R), LPV (ECCO(2)R when PaCO(2) > 55 mmHg) and Ultra-LPV (ECCO(2)R for all). Patients characteristics, ventilation settings, survival and lengths of stay were derived from a large ARDS epidemiology study. Survival benefits associated with lower ?P were taken from the analysis of more than 3000 patients enrolled in 9 randomized trials. Health outcomes were expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were computed with both Day 60 cost and Lifetime cost. RESULTS: Both LPV and ULPV as enabled by ECCO2R provided favorable results at Day 60 as compared to MV. Survival rates were increased with the protective strategies, notably with ULPV that provided even more manifest benefits as compared to MV. LPV and ULPV produced +0.162 and + 0.627 incremental QALYs as compared to MV, respectively. LPV and ULPV costs were augmented because of their survival benefits. Nonetheless, ICERs of LPV and ULPV vs. MV were all well below the €50,000 threshold. ULPV also presented with favorable ICERs as compared to LPV (i.e. less than €25,000/QALY).

However, high costs limit clinical applications. Thus, we conducted this cost-effectiveness analysis to explore an optimal first-line treatment for advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Survival data were extracted from six clinical trials, including ARCHER1050 (dacomitinib vs. gefitinib); FLAURA (osimertinib vs. gefitinib/erlotinib); JO25567 and NEJ026 (bevacizumab +erlotinib vs. erlotinib); NEJ009 (gefitinib +chemotherapy vs. gefitinib); and NCT02148380 (gefitinib +chemotherapy vs. gefitinib vs. chemotherapy) trials. Cost-related data were obtained from hospitals and published literature. The effect parameter (quality-adjusted life year [QALY]) was the reflection of both survival and utility. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER), and net benefit were calculated, and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set at $30828/QALY from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. Sensitivity analysis was performed to explore the stability of results. RESULTS: We compared treatment groups with control groups in each trial.

Moreover, ACER and net benefit showed that the combination of EGFR-TKI with chemotherapy and osimertinib was of more economic benefit following first-generation EGFR-TKIs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the impact of utilities and monotherapy could be cost-effective with a 50% cost reduction.

33194,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Helicobacter pylori Eradication Therapy in First-Degree Relatives of Patients with Gastric Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of gastric cancer in patients who have a family history of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of H. pylori eradication therapy in a select population in the People''s Republic of China. METHODS: A Markov model was applied to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of H. pylori eradication therapy. The long-term costs of H. pylori eradication therapy were calculated from the Chinese perspective. Health outcomes were measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Epidemiological information and health utilities used in the model were collected from published literatures or statistical bureaus. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the influence of parameters on the uncertainty of the model. RESULTS: Compared with the no eradication therapy group, H. pylori eradication therapy prolonged an average of 4.52 QALYs (32.64 QALYs vs 28.12 QALYs) and saved $3227.07 ($2472.83 vs $5699.90). The cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that no H. pylori eradication therapy cost more and produced less QALYs. It was dominated by H. pylori eradication therapy. The one-way sensitive analyses proved that the results were robust to the fluctuations of the input parameters. CONCLUSION: H. pylori eradication therapy not only reduced the risk of gastric cancer in first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer but also was an economical strategy with lower costs and greater efficacy.",2021-01-34667,33519193,Patient Prefer Adherence,Hanrui Zheng,2021,15 /,77-85,No,33519193,"Hanrui Zheng; Qian Xie; Mei Zhan; Chaohui Jin; Qiu Li; Steffie K Naber; Patricia C J L Bruijning-Verhagen; Marieke L A de Hoog; Anoukh van Giessen; Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Helicobacter pylori Eradication Therapy in First-Degree Relatives of Patients with Gastric Cancer, Patient Prefer Adherence, 2021; 15():1177-889X; 77-85",QALY,China,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,"Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy + endoscopic monitoring vs. no eradication therapy + endoscopic monitoring every 2 years,first-degree relative with gastric cancer,Not Stated,40 Years,"Male, Female",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,-712.38,United States,2019,-755.05

Findings from the phase III NETTER-1 trial showed that treatment of unresectable/metastatic progressive gastrointestinal (GI) NETs with (177)Lu-Dotatate resulted in a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with best supportive care (BSC) with high dose octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) 60?mg. A health economic analysis was performed using input data from clinical studies and data derived from an indirect comparison to determine the cost-effectiveness of (177)Lu-Dotatate in the treatment of GI-NETs and pancreatic NETs (P-NETs) in Scotland. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the payer perspective using a three-state partitioned survival model. In the base case (177)Lu-Dotatate was compared with BSC in gastrointestinal (GI)-NETs using clinical data from the NETTER-1 trial. A secondary analysis comparing (177)Lu-Dotatate with BSC, everolimus or sunitinib in patients with P-NETs was also performed using hazard ratios inferred from indirect comparisons. The base case analysis was performed over a 20-year time horizon with an annual discount rate of 3.5% for both costs and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: For unresectable/metastatic progressive GI-NETs treatment with (177)Lu-Dotatate led to a gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.33 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with BSC due to extended PFS and OS. Mean total lifetime costs were GBP 35,701 higher with (177)Lu-Dotatate, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 26,830 per QALY gained.

Mean total lifetime costs were GBP 35,701 higher with (177)Lu-Dotatate, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 26,830 per QALY gained. In analyses in patients with P-NETs (177)Lu-Dotatate was associated with ICERs below GBP 30,000 per QALY gained in comparisons with BSC, sunitinib and everolimus.

33198,Lutetium oxodotreotide ((177)Lu-Dotatate) for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic progressive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors: a cost-effectiveness analysis for Scotland,"BACKGROUND: Gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) represent a heterogenous group of tumors. Findings from the phase III NETTER-1 trial showed that treatment of unresectable/metastatic progressive gastrointestinal (GI) NETs with (177)Lu-Dotatate resulted in a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with best supportive care (BSC) with high dose octreotide long-acting repeatable (LAR) 60?mg. A health economic analysis was performed using input data from clinical studies and data derived from an indirect comparison to determine the cost-effectiveness of (177)Lu-Dotatate in the treatment of GI-NETs and pancreatic NETs (P-NETs) in Scotland. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the payer perspective using a three-state partitioned survival model. In the base case (177)Lu-Dotatate was compared with BSC in gastrointestinal (GI)-NETs using clinical data from the NETTER-1 trial. A secondary analysis comparing (177)Lu-Dotatate with BSC, everolimus or sunitinib in patients with P-NETs was also performed using hazard ratios inferred from indirect comparisons. The base case analysis was performed over a 20-year time horizon with an annual discount rate of 3.5% for both costs and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: For unresectable/metastatic progressive GI-NETs treatment with (177)Lu-Dotatate led to a gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 1.33 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with BSC due to extended PFS and OS.

33199,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of renal replacement therapy strategies in Guangzhou city, southern China","OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of three renal replacement therapy (RRT) modalities as well as proposed changes of scheduled policies in RRT composition in Guangzhou city. METHODS: From a payer perspective, we designed Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analyses to compare the cost-effectiveness of three RRT modalities and four different scheduled policies to RRT modalities in Guangzhou over three time horizons (5, 10 and 15 years). The current situation (scenario 1: haemodialysis (HD), 73%; peritoneal dialysis (PD), 14%; kidney transplantation (TX), 13%) was compared with three different scenarios: an increased proportion of incident RRT patients on PD (scenario 2: HD, 47%; PD, 40%; TX, 13%); on TX (scenario 3: HD, 52%; PD, 14%; TX, 34%); on both PD and TX (Scenario 4: HD, 26%; PD, 40%; TX, 34%). RESULTS: Over 5-year time horizon, HD was dominated by PD. At a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$44 300, TX was cost-effective compared with PD with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$35?518 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The scenario 2 held a dominant position over the scenario 1, with a net saving of US$ 5.92?million and an additional gain of 6.24 QALYs. The scenarios 3 and 4 were cost-effective compared with scenario 1 at a WTP threshold of US$44?300. The above results were consistent across the three time horizons. CONCLUSIONS: TX is the most cost-effective RRT modality, followed in order by PD and HD. The strategy with an increased proportion of incident patients on PD and TX is cost-effective compared with the current practice pattern at the given WTP threshold.
