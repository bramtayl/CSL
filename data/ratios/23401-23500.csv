23401,Robotic versus laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer: a comparative cost-effectiveness study,"Background: The differences between the costs of robotic rectal resection and of the laparoscopic approach are still not well known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of robotic versus laparoscopic surgery. Methods: We conducted an observational, comparative, prospective, non-randomized study on patients having laparoscopic and robotic rectal resection between February 2014 and March 2018 at the Sanchinarro University Hospital, Madrid. Outcome parameters included surgical and post-operative costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental cost per QALY gained or the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). The primary endpoint was to compare cost effectiveness in the robotic and laparoscopic surgery groups. A willingness-to-pay of 20,000€ and 30,000€ per QALY was used as a threshold to determine the most cost-effective treatment. Results: A total of 81 RRR and 104 LRR were included. The mean operative costs were higher for RRR (4307.09€ versus 3834.58€; p = 0.04), although mean overall costs were similar (7272.03€ for RRR and 6968.63€ for the LLR; p = 0.44). Mean QALYs at 1 year for the RRR group (0.8482) was higher than that associated with LRR (0.6532) (p = 0.018). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000€ and 30,000€ there was a 95.54% and 97.18% probability, respectively, that RRR was more cost-effective than LRR. Conclusions: Our data regarding the cost-effectiveness of RRR versus LRR shows a benefit for RRR. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020-01-32998,32020350,Tech.

23402,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Screening for Persistent Hepatitis E Virus Infection in Solid Organ Transplant Patients in the United Kingdom: A Model-Based Economic Evaluation,"Background: Despite potentially severe and fatal outcomes, recent studies of solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients in Europe suggest that hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is underdiagnosed, with a prevalence of active infection of up to 4.4%. Objectives: To determine the cost-effectiveness of introducing routine screening for HEV infection in SOT recipients in the UK. Methods: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the cost-utility of 4 HEV screening options over the lifetime of 1000 SOT recipients. The current baseline of nonsystematic testing was compared with annual screening of all patients by polymerase chain reaction (PCR; strategy A) or HEV-antigen (HEV-Ag) detection (strategy B) and selective screening of patients who have a raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value by PCR (strategy C) or HEV-Ag (strategy D). The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We adopted the National Health Service (NHS) perspective and discounted future costs and benefits at 3.5%. Results: At a willingness-to-pay of £20 000/QALY gained, systematic screening of SOT patients by any method (strategy A-D) had a high probability (77.9%) of being cost-effective. Among screening strategies, strategy D is optimal and expected to be cost-saving to the NHS; if only PCR testing strategies are considered, then strategy C becomes cost-effective (£660/QALY). These findings were robust against a wide range of sensitivity and scenario analyses. Conclusions: Our model showed that routine screening for HEV in SOT patients is very likely to be cost-effective in the UK, particularly in patients presenting with an abnormal alanine aminotransferase. © 2019 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",2020-01-32999,32197726,Value Health,J Ankcorn,2020,23 / 3,309-318,Yes,32197726,"J Ankcorn; S Tedder; J Cairns; G Sandmann; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Screening for Persistent Hepatitis E Virus Infection in Solid Organ Transplant Patients in the United Kingdom: A Model-Based Economic Evaluation, Value Health, 2020; 23(3):1098-3015; 309-318",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Screening,hepatitis e screening with hepatitis e virus antigen elisa assay --> pcr confirmatory assay vs. None,Not Stated,48 Years,48 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-3600.94,United Kingdom,2017,-4900.98

The public list price is US 475000, or more than CaD 600000. Assessing the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is necessary to inform policy makers on the economic value of this treatment. Objective: To assess the value for money of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for tisagenlecleucel-eligible pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under unknown long-term effectiveness. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cost-utility analysis of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care using a Canadian population-based registry of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was performed. Results from 3 pooled single-arm tisagenlecleucel clinical trials and a provincial pediatric cancer registry were combined to create treatment and control arms, respectively. The population-based control arm consisted of patients meeting clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, starting at second relapse. Multistate and individual-level simulation modeling were combined to predict patient lifetime health trajectories by treatment strategy. Tisagenlecleucel efficacy was modeled across long-term cure rates, from 10% to 40%, to account for limited information on its long-term effectiveness. Uncertainty was tested with 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data were collected in September 2017, and analysis began in December 2017. Exposures: Tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for tisagenlecleucel-eligible patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: Relative health care costs, survival gains, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between tisagenlecleucel and current standard care. Results: The treatment and control arms were modeled on 192 and 118 patients, respectively. The mean (SD) age of control individuals was 10 (4.25) years, and the mean (SD) age of the pooled clinical trial sample was 11 (6) years. The control individuals had 78 boys (66%), and the pooled clinical trial sample had 102 boys (53%). Treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with an additional 2.14 to 9.85 life years or 1.68 to 6.61 QALYs, compared with current care. The average additional cost of tisagenlecleucel was CaD 470013 (US 357031). Accounting for the total discounted cost over the patient lifetime resulted in an incremental cost of CaD 71000 (US 53933) to CaD 281000 (US 213453) per QALY gain. Conclusions and Relevance: To our knowledge, this study offers the first cost-effectiveness analysis of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using a constructed population-based control arm. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 150000/QALY, tisagenlecleucel had a 32% likelihood of being cost-effective. Tisagenlecleucel cost-effectiveness would fall below 50000/QALY with a long-term cure rate of over 0.40 or a price discount of 49% at its currently known effectiveness. © 2019 American Medical Association.

23414,Cost-effectiveness of Tisagenlecleucel vs Standard Care in High-risk Relapsed Pediatric Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Canada,"Importance: Tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy for relapsed or refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia, has been approved for use in multiple jurisdictions. The public list price is US 475000, or more than CaD 600000. Assessing the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is necessary to inform policy makers on the economic value of this treatment. Objective: To assess the value for money of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for tisagenlecleucel-eligible pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia under unknown long-term effectiveness. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cost-utility analysis of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care using a Canadian population-based registry of pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was performed. Results from 3 pooled single-arm tisagenlecleucel clinical trials and a provincial pediatric cancer registry were combined to create treatment and control arms, respectively. The population-based control arm consisted of patients meeting clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, starting at second relapse. Multistate and individual-level simulation modeling were combined to predict patient lifetime health trajectories by treatment strategy. Tisagenlecleucel efficacy was modeled across long-term cure rates, from 10% to 40%, to account for limited information on its long-term effectiveness. Uncertainty was tested with 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Data were collected in September 2017, and analysis began in December 2017. Exposures: Tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for tisagenlecleucel-eligible patients. Main Outcomes and Measures: Relative health care costs, survival gains, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between tisagenlecleucel and current standard care. Results: The treatment and control arms were modeled on 192 and 118 patients, respectively. The mean (SD) age of control individuals was 10 (4.25) years, and the mean (SD) age of the pooled clinical trial sample was 11 (6) years. The control individuals had 78 boys (66%), and the pooled clinical trial sample had 102 boys (53%). Treatment with tisagenlecleucel was associated with an additional 2.14 to 9.85 life years or 1.68 to 6.61 QALYs, compared with current care. The average additional cost of tisagenlecleucel was CaD 470013 (US 357031). Accounting for the total discounted cost over the patient lifetime resulted in an incremental cost of CaD 71000 (US 53933) to CaD 281000 (US 213453) per QALY gain. Conclusions and Relevance: To our knowledge, this study offers the first cost-effectiveness analysis of tisagenlecleucel compared with current standard care for pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia using a constructed population-based control arm. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 150000/QALY, tisagenlecleucel had a 32% likelihood of being cost-effective. Tisagenlecleucel cost-effectiveness would fall below 50000/QALY with a long-term cure rate of over 0.40 or a price discount of 49% at its currently known effectiveness. © 2019 American Medical Association.

23415,Cost-effectiveness of stereotactic body radiation therapy versus video assisted thoracic surgery in medically operable stage I non-small cell lung cancer: A modeling study,"Objectives: Stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be treated with either Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) or Video Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) resection. To support decision making, not only the impact on survival needs to be taken into account, but also on quality of life, costs and cost-effectiveness. Therefore, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing SBRT to VATS resection with respect to quality adjusted life years (QALY) lived and costs in operable stage I NSCLC. Materials and methods: Patient level and aggregate data from eight Dutch databases were used to estimate costs, health utilities, recurrence free and overall survival. Propensity score matching was used to minimize selection bias in these studies. A microsimulation model predicting lifetime outcomes after treatment in stage I NSCLC patients was used for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Model outcomes for the two treatments were overall survival, QALYs, and total costs. We used a Dutch health care perspective with 1.5 % discounting for health effects, and 4 % discounting for costs, using 2018 cost data. The impact of model parameter uncertainty was assessed with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Patients receiving either VATS resection or SBRT were estimated to live 5.81 and 5.86 discounted QALYs, respectively. Average discounted lifetime costs in the VATS group were €29,269 versus €21,175 for SBRT. Difference in 90-day excess mortality between SBRT and VATS resection was the main driver for the difference in QALYs. SBRT was dominant in at least 74 % of the probabilistic simulations. Conclusion: Using a microsimulation model to combine available evidence on survival, costs, and health utilities in a cost-effectiveness analysis for stage I NSCLC led to the conclusion that SBRT dominates VATS resection in the majority of simulations. © 2020 The Authors",2020-01-33009,31982640,Lung Cancer,B Wolff,2020,141 /,89-96,No,31982640,"B Wolff; L Alberts; der van; L Bongers; E Verstegen; J Lagerwaard; N Hofman; Groot Uyl-de; S Senan; Sharouni El; A Kastelijn; M Schramel; M Coupé; Cost-effectiveness of stereotactic body radiation therapy versus video assisted thoracic surgery in medically operable stage I non-small cell lung cancer: A modeling study, Lung Cancer, 2020; 141():; 89-96",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Surgical",stereotactic body radiotherapy vs. video Assisted Thoracic Surgery resection,medically operable stage I,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,-161880,Euro,2018,-197161.71
23416,Cost-effectiveness of preventing child internalising problems: Results from the translational trial of Cool Little Kids at school entry,"Objective: A translational trial evaluated the effectiveness of screening for inhibited childhood temperament, followed by a preventive parenting program -Cool Little Kids. This study determined the cost-effectiveness from societal and health sector perspectives using trial data. Method: Resources to deliver the screening and parenting sessions were determined from study records. Parents completed a questionnaire reporting resources used at one-year follow-up. Standard Australian unit costs were applied. Clinical outcomes for children and parental quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: Total societal costs were lower, but non-significant for the intervention compared to the control group (mean difference -$500 p = 0.937). Total health sector costs were significantly greater (mean difference $1,956; p = 0.015). The intervention led to significantly fewer internalising symptoms (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)-emotional difficulties adjusted mean difference -0.5; p = 0.006), fewer children with SDQ-emotional symptoms in the abnormal range (24.2 % vs. 33.0 % p =.014) and fewer with diagnosed anxiety (44.2 % vs. 50.2 % p = 0.427). From the societal perspective, the intervention would likely be cost-effective. Health sector ICERs were $1,171/SDQ-emotional symptom decrease, $51/abnormal SDQ avoided and $77/anxiety case avoided.

23418,Cost-effectiveness of Intravitreal Ranibizumab With Verteporfin Photodynamic Therapy Compared With Ranibizumab Monotherapy for Patients With Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy,"Importance: The EVEREST II trial showed that for patients with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), intravitreal ranibizumab in combination with verteporfin photodynamic therapy improves visual acuity relative to ranibizumab monotherapy. However, whether combination therapy is incrementally cost-effective relative to monotherapy during a lifetime is unclear. Objective: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of combination therapy compared with ranibizumab monotherapy in patients with PCV. Design, Setting, and Participants: This model-based, economic evaluation used 2018 unit cost data from a tertiary eye hospital in Singapore, first- and second-year outcomes and resource use data from a multicenter trial across various Asian countries (EVEREST II) to model a hypothetical cohort of patients with symptomatic PCV. Scenario analyses and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine uncertainty. Data were collected from October 2018 through April 2019 and analyzed from March through October 2019. Interventions: This model used data from the EVEREST II trial, in which all participants were given 0.5 mg of intravitreal ranibizumab once every 4 weeks for the first 3 months. Subsequent administration occurred as needed. For participants receiving combination therapy, standard fluence (50 J/cm3) photodynamic therapy with 6-mg/m2 verteporfin was administered once during the first 3 months and thereafter as needed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for combination therapy relative to monotherapy for patients with PCV. Results: In this model based on a cohort of 1000 patients aged 68 years, a patient with PCV incurred a total cost in Singapore dollars (SGD) of 92327 (US $67399) with combination therapy and SGD 92371 (US $67431) with monotherapy during a lifetime horizon, generating a modest cost savings of SGD 44 (US $32) per patient undergoing combination therapy. Lifetime QALYs were estimated to be 7.87 for combination therapy and 7.85 for monotherapy, for an incremental gain of 0.02 QALYs. Combination therapy remained cost-saving or cost-effective in all lifetime scenarios modeled, but during shorter time horizons and at lower monotherapy costs, it may not be cost-effective. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found combination therapy to be a dominant (more effective and less costly) strategy, being similar in costs and slightly more effective than ranibizumab monotherapy during a lifetime horizon. However, decreasing the time horizon to less than 10 years and/or reductions in the cost of monotherapy may result in combination therapy no longer being cost-effective. © 2020 American Medical Association.

23419,Cost-Effectiveness of Transitional Care Services After Hospitalization With Heart Failure,"Background: Patients with heart failure (HF) discharged from the hospital are at high risk for death and rehospitalization. Transitional care service interventions attempt to mitigate these risks. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 3 types of postdischarge HF transitional care services and standard care. Design: Decision analytic microsimulation model. Data Sources: Randomized controlled trials, clinical registries, cohort studies, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention life tables, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services data, and National Inpatient Sample (Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project) data. Target Population: Patients with HF who were aged 75 years at hospital discharge. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Health care sector. Intervention: Disease management clinics, nurse home visits (NHVs), and nurse case management. Outcome Measures: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, net monetary benefits, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results of Base-Case Analysis: All 3 transitional care interventions examined were more costly and effective than standard care, with NHVs dominating the other 2 interventions. Compared with standard care, NHVs increased QALYs (2.49 vs. 2.25) and costs ($81 327 vs. $76 705), resulting in an ICER of $19 570 per QALY gained. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Results were largely insensitive to variations in in-hospital mortality, age at baseline, or costs of rehospitalization. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed that transitional care services were preferred over standard care in nearly all 10 000 samples, at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50 000 or more per QALY gained. Limitation: Transitional care service designs and implementations are heterogeneous, leading to uncertainty about intervention effectiveness and costs when applied in particular settings.

23422,Cost-effectiveness analysis of cetuximab combined with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment for patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer based on the TAILOR trial,"Objectives Cetuximab plus leucovorin, fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) is superior to FOLFOX-4 alone as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with RAS wild-type (RAS wt mCRC), with significantly improved survival benefit by TAILOR, an open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase III trial. Nevertheless, the cost-effectiveness of these two regimens remains uncertain. The following study aims to determine whether cetuximab combined with FOLFOX-4 is a cost-effective regimen for patients with specific RAS wt mCRC in China. Design A cost-effectiveness model combined decision tree and Markov model was built to simulate pateints with RAS wt mCRC based on health states of dead, progressive and stable. The health outcomes from the TAILOR trial and utilities from published data were used respectively. Costs were calculated with reference to the Chinese societal perspective. The robustness of the results was evaluated by univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Participants The included patients were newly diagnosed Chinese patients with fully RAS wt mCRC. Interventions First-line treatment with either cetuximab plus FOLFOX-4 or FOLFOX-4. Main outcome measures The primary outcomes are costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results Baseline analysis disclosed that the QALYs was increased by 0.383 caused by additional cetuximab, while an increase of US62 947 was observed in relation to FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy. The ICER was US164 044 per QALY, which exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold of US28 106 per QALY. Conclusions Despite the survival benefit, cetuximab combined with FOLFOX-4 is not a cost-effective treatment for the first-line regime of patients with RAS wt mCRC in China.

23423,Lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis of first-line dialysis modalities for patients with end-stage renal disease under peritoneal dialysis first policy,"Background: This study aimed to determine the lifetime cost-effectiveness of first-line dialysis modalities for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients under the ""Peritoneal Dialysis First"" policy. Methods: Lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses from both healthcare provider and societal perspectives were performed using Markov modelling by simulating at age 60. Empirical data on costs and health utility scores collected from our studies were combined with published data on health state transitions and survival data to estimate the lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of three competing dialysis modalities: peritoneal dialysis (PD), hospital-based haemodialysis (HD) and nocturnal home HD. Results: For cost-effectiveness analysis over a lifetime horizon from the perspective of healthcare provider, hospital-based HD group (lifetime cost USD$142,389; 6.58 QALYs) was dominated by the PD group (USD$76,915; 7.13 QALYs). Home-based HD had the highest effectiveness (8.37 QALYs) but with higher cost (USD$97,917) than the PD group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was USD$16,934 per QALY gained for home-based HD over PD. From the societal perspective, the results were similar and the ICER was USD$1195 per QALY gained for home-based HD over PD. Both ICERs fell within the acceptable thresholds. Changes in model parameters via sensitivity analyses had a minimal impact on ICER values. Conclusions: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of dialysis modalities and service delivery models for ESRD patients under ""Peritoneal Dialysis First"" policy. For both healthcare provider and societal perspectives, PD as first-line dialysis modality was cost-saving relative to hospital-based HD, supporting the existing PD First or favoured policy.

From the societal perspective, the results were similar and the ICER was USD$1195 per QALY gained for home-based HD over PD. Both ICERs fell within the acceptable thresholds. Changes in model parameters via sensitivity analyses had a minimal impact on ICER values. Conclusions: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of dialysis modalities and service delivery models for ESRD patients under ""Peritoneal Dialysis First"" policy. For both healthcare provider and societal perspectives, PD as first-line dialysis modality was cost-saving relative to hospital-based HD, supporting the existing PD First or favoured policy.

23427,Economic Evaluation of Hepatitis C Treatment Extension to Acute Infection and Early-Stage Fibrosis Among Patients Who Inject Drugs in Developing Countries: A Case of China,"We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of (1) treating acute hepatitis C virus (HCV) vs deferring treatment until the chronic phase and (2) treating all chronic patients vs only those with advanced fibrosis; among Chinese genotype 1b treatment-naïve patients who injected drugs (PWID), using a combination Daclatasvir (DCV) plus Asunaprevir (ASV) regimen and a Peg-interferon (PegIFN)-based regimen, respectively. A decision-analytical model including the risk of HCV reinfection simulated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of three treatment timings, under the DCV+ASV and PegIFN regimen, respectively: Treating acute infection (“Treat at acute”), treating chronic patients of all fibrosis stages (“Treat at F0 (no fibrosis)”), treating only advanced-stage fibrosis patients (“Treat at F3 (numerous septa without cirrhosis)”). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were used to compare scenarios. “Treat at acute” compared with “Treat at F0” was cost-saving (cost: DCV+ASV regimen—US$14,486.975 vs US$16,224.250; PegIFN-based regimen—US$19,734.794 vs US$22,101.584) and more effective (QALY: DCV+ASV regimen— 14.573 vs 14.566; PegIFN-based regimen—14.148 vs 14.116). Compared with “Treat at F3”; “Treat at F0” exhibited an ICER of US$3780.20/QALY and US$15,145.98/QALY under the DCV+ASV regimen and PegIFN-based regimen; respectively.

23429,Cost effectiveness of in vitro fertilisation and preimplantation genetic testing to prevent transmission of BRCA1/2 mutations,"STUDY QUESTION: Is it cost-effective to use in vitro fertilisation and preimplantation genetic testing of monogenic defects (IVT/PGT-M) to prevent transmission of BRCA1/2 mutations to second-generation new births in comparison with naturally conceived births? SUMMARY ANSWER: In this cost-effectiveness analysis, we found that IVF/PGT-M is cost-effective for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers if using a willingness to pay of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation have a significantly increased risk of several types of cancer throughout their lifetime. The cost of risk reduction, screening and treatment of cancer in this population is high. In addition, there is a 50% chance of passing on this genetic mutation to each child. One option to avoid transmission of an inherited deleterious gene to one''s offspring involves in vitro fertilisation with preimplantation genetic testing. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We implemented a state transition model comparing the healthcare impact of a cohort of healthy children born after IVF/PGT-M, who have a population risk of developing cancer, to a cohort of naturally conceived live-births, half of whom are carriers of the BRCA mutation. Transition probabilities are based on published sources, a lifetime horizon and a perspective of a provincial Ministry of Health in Canada. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The target population is the second-generation new births who have at least one parent with a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per QALY, IVF/PGT-M is a cost-effective intervention for carriers of either BRCA mutation. For BRCA1, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for IVF/PGT-M is $14 242/QALY. For BRCA2, the ICER of intervention is $12 893/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results show that IVF/PGT-M has a 98.4 and 97.3% chance of being cost-effective for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, respectively, at the $50 000/QALY threshold. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Our model did not include the short-term negative effect of IVF/PGT-M on the woman''s quality of life; in addition, our model did not consider any ethical issues related to post-implantation genetic testing. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: In countries in which the healthcare of a large segment of the population is covered by a single payer system such as the government, it would be cost-effective for that payer to cover the cost of IVF/PGT-M for couples in which one member has a BRCA mutation, in order to avoid the future costs and disutility of managing offspring with an inherited BRCA mutation.

23431,Economic Evaluation of Adding Daratumumab to a Regimen of Bortezomib + Dexamethasone in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma: Based on the Latest Updated Analysis of CASTOR,"Purpose: Adding daratumumab to a regimen of bortezomib + dexamethasone (Vd) has been reported to provide a benefit of longer progression-free survival in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). However, it is still unclear whether the addition of daratumumab is cost-effective in RRMM. Based on the latest updated analysis of data from the CASTOR trial, this study performed an economic evaluation of the addition of daratumumab to Vd in patients with RRMM. Methods: A Markov decision model was used for estimating the long-term costs and efficacy of Vd with or without daratumumab in patients with RRMM. Data on efficacy were taken from the CASTOR trial to compare Vd + daratumumab with Vd. Costs were taken from the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and from the literature. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to address the robustness of the model. Variations in the price of daratumumab and subgroup analyses were conducted. Findings: The base-case analysis showed that adding daratumumab to Vd provided an additional 1.256 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) or 1.645 life-years (LYs), with incremental 213,164 USD (163,184 USD) per QALY (LY) gained. Univariate sensitivity analyses suggested that the subsequent treatment cost of DVd and the price of daratumumab had the greatest effect on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. According to the variations analysis of the price of daratumumab, the addition of daratumumab would be cost-effective when daratumumab was priced at 70% (30%) of the current price at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 200,000 USD/QALY (150,000 USD/QALY). Subgroup analysis indicated that adding daratumumab to Vd was most cost-effective in patients with 1 prior line of therapy. Implications: From a US-payer perspective, daratumumab added to Vd in RRMM is likely to exceed the common accepted values of cost-effectiveness © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",2020-01-33049,31973936,Clin Ther,X Zeng,2020,42 / 2,251-26200000,Yes,31973936,"X Zeng; L Peng; Y Peng; C Tan; X Wan; Economic Evaluation of Adding Daratumumab to a Regimen of Bortezomib + Dexamethasone in Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma: Based on the Latest Updated Analysis of CASTOR, Clin Ther, 2020; 42(2):1879-114X; 251-26200000",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,bortezomib + dexamethasone vs. Daratumumab + bortezomib --> dexamethasone,Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,213164,United States,2018,219703.9
23432,Cost effectiveness of an intervention to increase uptake of hepatitis C virus testing and treatment (HepCATT): cluster randomised controlled trial in primary care,"Objective To evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a complex intervention in primary care that aims to increase uptake of hepatitis C virus (HCV) case finding and treatment. Design Pragmatic, two armed, practice level, cluster randomised controlled trial and economic evaluation. Setting and participants 45 general practices in South West England (22 randomised to intervention and 23 to control arm). Outcome data were collected from all intervention practices and 21/23 control practices. Total number of flagged patients was 24 473 (about 5% of practice list). Intervention Electronic algorithm and flag on practice systems identifying patients with HCV risk markers (such as history of opioid dependence or HCV tests with no evidence of referral to hepatology), staff educational training in HCV, and practice posters/leaflets to increase patients'' awareness. Flagged patients were invited by letter for an HCV test (with one follow-up) and had on-screen pop-ups to encourage opportunistic testing. The intervention lasted one year, with practices recruited April to December 2016. Main outcome measures Primary outcome: uptake of HCV testing. Secondary outcomes: number of positive HCV tests and yield (proportion HCV positive); HCV treatment assessment at hepatology; cost effectiveness. Results Baseline HCV testing of flagged patients (six months before study start) was 608/13 097 (4.6%) in intervention practices and 380/11 376 (3.3%) in control practices. During the study 2071 (16%) of flagged patients in the intervention practices and 1163 (10%) in control practices were tested for HCV: overall intervention effect as an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% confidence interval 1.21 to 2.08; P<0.001). HCV antibodies were detected in 129 patients from intervention practices and 51 patients from control practices (adjusted rate ratio 2.24, 1.47 to 3.42) with weak evidence of an increase in yield (6.2% v 4.4%; adjusted risk ratio 1.40, 0.99 to 1.95). Referral and assessment increased in intervention practices compared with control practices (adjusted rate ratio 5.78, 1.6 to 21.6) with a risk difference of 1.3 per 1000 and a ""number needed to help"" of one extra HCV diagnosis, referral, and assessment per 792 (95% confidence interval 558 to 1883) patients flagged. The average cost of HCV case finding was £4.03 (95% confidence interval £2.27 to £5.80) per at risk patient and £3165 per additional patient assessed at hepatology. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio was £6212 per quality adjusted life year (QALY), with 92.5% probability of being below £20 000 per QALY. Conclusion HepCATT had a modest impact but is a low cost intervention that merits optimisation and implementation as part of an NHS strategy to increase HCV testing and treatment.

23433,Cost-effectiveness of Imaging Protocols for Suspected Appendicitis,"BACKGROUND: Inaccurate diagnosis of appendicitis leads to increased costs and morbidity. Ultrasound costs less than computed tomography (CT) or MRI but has lower sensitivity and may not visualize the appendix. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision-analytic model of 10 imaging strategies for suspected appendicitis in a hypothetical cohort of patients: no imaging with discharge or surgery; CT only; MRI only; or staged approach with CT or MRI after 1) negative ultrasound result or ultrasound without appendix visualization, 2) ultrasound without appendix visualization, or 3) ultrasound without appendix visualization but with secondary signs of inflammation. Inputs were derived from published literature and secondary data (quality-of-life and cost data). Sensitivity analyses varied risk of appendicitis and proportion of visualized ultrasound. Outcomes were effectiveness (quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), total direct medical costs, and cost-effectiveness (cost per QALY gained). RESULTS: The most cost-effective strategy for patients at moderate risk for appendicitis is initial ultrasound, followed by CT if the appendix is not visualized but secondary signs are present (cost of $4815.03; effectiveness of 0.99694 QALYs). Other strategies were well above standard willingness-to-pay thresholds or were more costly and less effective. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to patients’ risk of appendicitis but not the proportion of visualized appendices. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored approaches to imaging based on patients’ risk of appendicitis are the most cost-effective. Imaging is not cost-effective in patients with a probability,16% or .95%. For moderate-risk patients, ultrasound without secondary signs of inflammation is sufficient even without appendix visualization. © 2020 American Academy of Pediatrics.

RESULTS: The most cost-effective strategy for patients at moderate risk for appendicitis is initial ultrasound, followed by CT if the appendix is not visualized but secondary signs are present (cost of $4815.03; effectiveness of 0.99694 QALYs). Other strategies were well above standard willingness-to-pay thresholds or were more costly and less effective. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to patients’ risk of appendicitis but not the proportion of visualized appendices. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored approaches to imaging based on patients’ risk of appendicitis are the most cost-effective. Imaging is not cost-effective in patients with a probability,16% or .95%. For moderate-risk patients, ultrasound without secondary signs of inflammation is sufficient even without appendix visualization. © 2020 American Academy of Pediatrics.

23435,An adaptable implementation package targeting evidence-based indicators in primary care: A pragmatic cluster-randomised evaluation,"BACKGROUND: In primary care, multiple priorities and system pressures make closing the gap between evidence and practice challenging. Most implementation studies focus on single conditions, limiting generalisability. We compared an adaptable implementation package against an implementation control and assessed effects on adherence to four different evidence-based quality indicators. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We undertook two parallel, pragmatic cluster-randomised trials using balanced incomplete block designs in general practices in West Yorkshire, England. We used ''opt-out'' recruitment, and we randomly assigned practices that did not opt out to an implementation package targeting either diabetes control or risky prescribing (Trial 1); or blood pressure (BP) control or anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation (AF) (Trial 2). Within trials, each arm acted as the implementation control comparison for the other targeted indicator. For example, practices assigned to the diabetes control package acted as the comparison for practices assigned to the risky prescribing package. The implementation package embedded behaviour change techniques within audit and feedback, educational outreach, and computerised support, with content tailored to each indicator. Respective patient-level primary endpoints at 11 months comprised the following: achievement of all recommended levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), BP, and cholesterol; risky prescribing levels; achievement of recommended BP; and anticoagulation prescribing. Between February and March 2015, we recruited 144 general practices collectively serving over 1 million patients. We stratified computer-generated randomisation by area, list size, and pre-intervention outcome achievement. In April 2015, we randomised 80 practices to Trial 1 (40 per arm) and 64 to Trial 2 (32 per arm). Practices and trial personnel were not blind to allocation. Two practices were lost to follow-up but provided some outcome data. We analysed the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, adjusted for potential confounders at patient level (sex, age) and practice level (list size, locality, pre-intervention achievement against primary outcomes, total quality scores, and levels of patient co-morbidity), and analysed cost-effectiveness. The implementation package reduced risky prescribing (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 97.5% confidence interval [CI] 0.67-0.99, p = 0.017) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of £1,359 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but there was insufficient evidence of effect on other primary endpoints (diabetes control OR 1.03, 97.5% CI 0.89-1.18, p = 0.693; BP control OR 1.05, 97.5% CI 0.96-1.16, p = 0.215; anticoagulation prescribing OR 0.90, 97.5% CI 0.75-1.09, p = 0.214). No statistically significant effects were observed in any secondary outcome except for reduced co-prescription of aspirin and clopidogrel without gastro-protection in patients aged 65 and over (adjusted OR 0.62; 97.5% CI 0.39-0.99; p = 0.021). Main study limitations concern our inability to make any inferences about the relative effects of individual intervention components, given the multifaceted nature of the implementation package, and that the composite endpoint for diabetes control may have been too challenging to achieve. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that a multifaceted implementation package was clinically and cost-effective for targeting prescribing behaviours within the control of clinicians but not for more complex behaviours that also required patient engagement.

23437,Cost-effectiveness of a patient-centred approach to managing multimorbidity in primary care: a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial,"Objective Patients with multiple chronic health conditions are often managed in a disjointed fashion in primary care, with annual review clinic appointments offered separately for each condition. This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of the 3D intervention, which was developed to improve the system of care. Design Economic evaluation conducted alongside a pragmatic cluster-randomised trial. Setting General practices in three centres in England and Scotland. Participants 797 adults with three or more chronic conditions were randomised to the 3D intervention, while 749 participants were randomised to receive usual care. Intervention The 3D approach: comprehensive 6-monthly general practitioner consultations, supported by medication reviews and nurse appointments. Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary economic evaluation assessed the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services (PSS). Costs were related to changes in a range of secondary outcomes (QALYs accrued by both participants and carers, and deaths) in a cost-consequences analysis from the perspectives of the NHS/PSS, patients/carers and productivity losses. Results Very small increases were found in both QALYs (adjusted mean difference 0.007 (-0.009 to 0.023)) and costs (adjusted mean difference £126 (£-739 to £991)) in the intervention arm compared with usual care after 15 months. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £18 499, with a 50.8% chance of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000 per QALY (55.8% at £30 000 per QALY). Conclusions The small differences in costs and outcomes were consistent with chance, and the uncertainty was substantial; therefore, the evidence for the cost-effectiveness of the 3D approach from the NHS/PSS perspective should be considered equivocal.

23438,Cost-effectiveness of total knee replacement in addition to non-surgical treatment: a 2-year outcome from a randomised trial in secondary care in Denmark,"Objective To assess the 24-month cost-effectiveness of total knee replacement (TKR) plus non-surgical treatment compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR if needed. Methods 100 adults with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis found eligible for TKR by an orthopaedic surgeon in secondary care were randomised to TKR plus 12 weeks of supervised non-surgical treatment (exercise, education, diet, insoles and pain medication) or to supervised non-surgical treatment alone. Including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) data from baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months, effectiveness was measured as change at 24 months. Healthcare costs and transfer payments were derived from national registries. Incremental healthcare costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted and the probability of cost-effectiveness was estimated at the 22 665 Euros/QALY threshold defined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Results TKR plus non-surgical treatment was more expensive (mean of 23 076 vs 14 514 Euros) but also more effective than non-surgical treatment (mean 24-month improvement in QALY of 0.195 vs 0.056). While cost-effective in the unadjusted scenario (ICER of 18 497 Euros/QALY), TKR plus non-surgical treatment was not cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR if needed in the adjusted (age, sex and baseline values), base-case scenario (ICER of 32 611 Euros/QALY) with a probability of cost-effectiveness of 23.2%. Including deaths, TKR plus non-surgical treatment was still not cost-effective (ICERs of 46 277 to 64 208 Euros/QALY). Conclusions From a 24-month perspective, TKR plus non-surgical treatment does not appear to be cost-effective compared with non-surgical treatment with the option of later TKR if needed in patients with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis and moderate intensity pain in secondary care in Denmark. Results were sensitive to changes, highlighting the need for further confirmatory research also assessing the long-term cost-effectiveness of TKR.

23439,Vaccinating children against influenza: overall cost-effective with potential for undesirable outcomes,"Background: The present study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of an influenza vaccination program for children in the Netherlands. This requires an evaluation of the long-term impact of such a program on the burden of influenza across all age groups, using a transmission model that accounts for the seasonal variability in vaccine effectiveness and the shorter duration of protection following vaccination as compared to natural infection. Methods: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a stochastic dynamic transmission model that has been calibrated to reported GP visits with influenza-like illness in the Netherlands over 11 seasons (2003/2004 to 2014/2015). We analyzed the costs and effects of extending the current program with vaccination of children aged 2-16 years at 50% coverage over 20 consecutive seasons. We measured the effects in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and we adopted a societal perspective. Results: The childhood vaccination program is estimated to have an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3944 per QALY gained and is cost-effective in the general population (across 1000 simulations; conventional Dutch threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained). The childhood vaccination program is not estimated to be cost-effective for the target-group itself with an average ICER of 57,054 per QALY gained. Uncertainty analyses reveal that these ICERs hide a wide range of outcomes. Even though introduction of a childhood vaccination program decreases the number of infections, it tends to lead to larger epidemics: In 23.3% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program results in an increase in seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%, which is expected to cause serious strain on the health care system. In 6.4% of 1000 simulations, the childhood vaccination program leads to a net loss of QALYs. These findings are robust across different targeted age groups and vaccination coverages. Conclusions: Modeling indicates that childhood influenza vaccination is cost-effective in the Netherlands. However, childhood influenza vaccination is not cost-effective when only outcomes for the children themselves are considered. In approximately a quarter of the simulations, the introduction of a childhood vaccination program increases the frequency of seasons with a symptomatic attack rate larger than 5%. The possibility of an overall health loss cannot be excluded. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020-01-33081,31931789,BMC Med.,Boer De,2020,18 / 1,-,No,31931789,"Boer De; A Backer; Hoek Van; J Wallinga; Vaccinating children against influenza: overall cost-effective with potential for undesirable outcomes, BMC Med., 2020; 18(1):; -",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Immunization,cp + 2-16y vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard/usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,4.00,1.50,3944,Euro,2017,4705.86

Methods: The incremental cost-utility was calculated from a healthcare perspective in the intention-to-treat population (n=379) of the 2-year open-label pragmatic randomised controlled Care in early RA trial. Healthcare costs were collected prospectively through electronic trial records. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated using mapping algorithms for EuroQoL-5 Dimension. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data and bootstrapping to calculate CIs. Robustness was tested with biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs at biosimilar prices. Results: In the high-risk group, Classic (dagger;k1.464, 95% CI-0.198 to 3.127) and Avant-Garde (dagger;k0.636, 95% CI-0.987 to 2.258) were more expensive compared with Slim and QALYs were slightly worse for Classic (dagger;-0.002, 95% CI-0.086 to 0.082) and Avant-Garde (dagger;-0.009, 95% CI-0.102 to 0.084). This resulted in the domination of Classic and Avant-Garde by Slim. In the low-risk group, Slim was cheaper (dagger;k-0.617, 95% CI-2.799 to 1.566) and QALYs were higher (dagger;0.141, 95% CI 0.008 to 0.274) compared with TSU, indicating Slim dominated. Results were robust against the price of biosimilars.

23444,Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with varying comorbidity burden,"Objectives While previous cost-effectiveness studies on pembrolizumab in stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have found these regimens to be cost-effective, their reliance on randomized controlled trial (RCT) data with strict inclusion criteria limits generalizability to patients with comorbidities. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of first-line pembrolizumab for patients with various comorbidities. Materials and methods In our base case analysis, we studied pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (pembrolizumab combination therapy) versus chemotherapy alone. In a secondary analysis, we considered only patients with PD-L1 expression of at least 50% (PD-L1-high) and evaluated pembrolizumab monotherapy, pembrolizumab combination therapy, and chemotherapy alone. Microsimulation models were developed for the base case and the PD-L1-high analyses. To estimate outcomes of patients with differing comorbidities, we combined survival data from patients with few or no comorbidities from the RCTs with estimates from the general population obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database. Comorbidity burden level was divided into three groups based on the Charlson score (equal to 0, 1, or 2+); patients with various other specific comorbidities were also analyzed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were compared to a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Results In the Charlson 0, Charlson 1, and Charlson 2+ patient populations, estimated ICERs for pembrolizumab combination therapy in the base case model were $173,919/QALY, $175,165/QALY, and $181,777/QALY, respectively, compared to chemotherapy. In the PD-L1-high model, the Charlson 0, Charlson 1, and Charlson 2+ patients had ICERs of $147,406/QALY, $149,026/QALY, and $154,521/QALY with pembrolizumab combination therapy versus chemotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy was weakly dominated for each comorbidity group in the PD-L1-high model. Conclusion For patients with stage IV NSCLC and varying comorbidity burden, first-line treatment with pembrolizumab does not represent a cost-effective strategy compared to chemotherapy. Resources should be focused on collecting immunotherapy survival data for more representative NSCLC patient populations. © 2020 Criss et al.",2020-01-33101,31995619,PLoS One,D Criss,2020,15 / 1,-,No,31995619,"D Criss; L Palazzo; R Watson; M Paquette; K Sigel; J Wisnivesky; Y Kong; Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with varying comorbidity burden, PLoS One , 2020; 15(1):1932-6203; -",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,pembrolizumab + chemotherapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- chemotherapy,"stage IV, charlston Score 0",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,173919,United States,2019,176064.61

23447,Real-world cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with vitamin K antagonists in the context of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in France,"Objective The objective was to assess the real-world cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban, versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) from a French national health insurance perspective. Methods A Markov model was developed with a lifetime horizon and cycle length of 3 months. All inputs were drawn from real-world evidence (RWE) studies: data on baseline patient characteristics at model entry were obtained from a French RWE study, clinical event rates as well as persistence rates for the VKA treatment arm were estimated from a variety of RWE studies, and a meta-analysis provided comparative effectiveness for rivaroxaban compared to VKA. Model outcomes included costs (drug costs, clinical event costs, and VKA monitoring costs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and life-years (LY) gained, incremental cost per QALY, and incremental cost per LY. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model and to better understand the results drivers. Results In the base-case analysis, the incremental total cost was €714 and the total incremental QALYs and LYs were 0.12 and 0.16, respectively. The resulting incremental cost/QALY and incremental cost/LY were €6,006 and €4,586, respectively. The results were more sensitive to the inclusion of treatment-specific utility decrements and clinical event rates. Conclusions Although there is no official willingness-to-pay threshold in France, these results suggest that rivaroxaban is likely to be cost-effective compared to VKA in French patients with AF from a national insurance perspective. © 2020 Bowrin et al.",2020-01-33107,31978044,PLoS One,K Bowrin,2020,15 / 1,-,No,31978044,"K Bowrin; -B Briere; L Fauchier; C Coleman; A Millier; M Toumi; E Clay; P Levy; Real-world cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with vitamin K antagonists in the context of stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation in France, PLoS One , 2020; 15(1):1932-6203; -",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,rivaroxaban vs. vitamin k antagonists,15% had an intermediate CHA2DS2-VASc score (= 1) and 85% had a high CHA2DS2-VASc score >=2,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,4.00,6006,Euro,2017,7166.17
23448,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) using the fulfil trial: A Spanish perspective,"Purpose: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of once-daily fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/ vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI) vs twice-daily budesonide/formoterol (BUD/FOR) in patients with symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at risk of exacerbations, from the Spanish National Healthcare System perspective. Patients and Methods: The validated GALAXY-COPD model was used to simulate disease progression and predict healthcare costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) over a 3-year time horizon for a Spanish population. Patient characteristics from published literature were supplemented by data from FULFIL (NCT02345161), which compared FF/UMEC/VI vs BUD/FOR in patients with symptomatic COPD at risk of exacerbations. Treatment effects, extrapolated to 3 years, were based on Week 24 results in the FULFIL intent-to-treat population, including change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second, St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire score, and exacerbation rates. Treatment, exacerbations, and COPD management costs (2019€) were informed by Spanish public sources and published literature. A 3% discount rate for costs and benefits was applied. One-way sensitivity and scenario analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), were performed. Results: FF/UMEC/VI treatment led to fewer moderate and severe exacerbations (2.126 and 0.306, respectively) vs BUD/FOR (2.608 and 0.515, respectively), with a mean incremental cost of €69 and gain of 0.107 QALYs, which resulted in an ICER of €642 per QALY gained. In sensitivity analyses, the ICER was most sensitive to treatment effect variations in exacerbations and healthcare resource utilization/event costs. Overall, 95% of 1000 PSA simulations resulted in an ICER less than €11,000 per QALY gained for FF/UMEC/VI vs BUD/FOR, confirming robustness of the results. The probability of FF/UMEC/VI being cost-effective vs BUD/FOR was 100% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of €30,000 per QALY gained. Conclusion: At the accepted Spanish ICER threshold of €30,000, FF/UMEC/VI represents a cost-effective treatment option vs BUD/FOR in patients with symptomatic COPD at risk of exacerbations. © 2020 Schroeder et al.",2020-01-33114,0,Int.

The NORDLAND randomized clinical trial,"Introduction The aim of our study was to perform an economic assessment in order to check whether or not telemonitoring of users with pacemakers offers a cost-effective alternative to traditional follow-up in outpatient clinics. Methods We used effectiveness and cost data from the NORDLAND trial, which is a controlled, randomized, non-masked clinical trial. Fifty patients were assigned to receive either telemonitoring (TM; n = 25) or conventional monitoring (CM; n = 25) and were followed up for 12 months after the implantation. A cost-utility analysis was performed in terms of additional costs per additional Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) attained from the perspectives of the Norwegian National Healthcare System and patients and their caregivers. Results Effectiveness was similar between alternatives (TM: 0.7804 [CI: 0.6864 to 0.8745] vs. CM: 0.7465 [CI: 0.6543 to 0.8387]), while cost per patient was higher in the RM group, both from the Norwegian NHS perspective (TM: €2,079.84 [CI: 0.00 to 4,610.58] vs. €271.97 [CI: 158.18 to 385.76]; p = 0.147) and including the patient/family perspective (TM: €2,295.91 [CI: 0.00 to 4,843.28] vs. CM: €430.39 [CI: 0.00 to 4,841.48]), although these large differences- mainly due to a few patients being hospitalized in the TM group, as opposed to none in the CM group-did not reach statistical significance. The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) from the Norwegian NHS perspective (€53,345.27/QALY) and including the patient/caregiver perspective (€55,046.40/QALY), as well as the Incremental Net Benefit (INB), favors the CM alternative, albeit with very broad 95%CIs. The probabilistic analysis confirmed inconclusive results due to the wide CIs even suggesting that TM was not cost-effective in this study. Supplemental analysis excluding the hospitalization costs shows positive INBs, whereby suggesting a discrete superiority of the RM alternative if hospitalization costs were not considered, albeit also with broad CIs. Conclusions Cost-utility analysis of TM vs. CM shows inconclusive results because of broad confidence intervals with ICER and INB figures ranging from potential savings to high costs for an additional QALY, with the majority of ICERs being above the usual NHS thresholds for coverage decisions. © 2020 Lopez-Villegas et al.

23451,Who Benefits Most from Collaborative Dementia Care from a Patient and Payer Perspective? A Subgroup Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Dementia care management (DCM) aims to provide optimal treatment for people with dementia (PwD). Treatment and care needs are dependent on patients'' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and thus, economic outcomes could depend on such characteristics. Objective: To detect important subgroups that benefit most from DCM and for which a significant effect on cost, QALY, and the individual cost-effectiveness could be achieved. Methods: The analysis was based on 444 participants of the DelpHi-trial. For each subgroup, the probability of DCM being cost-effective was calculated and visualized using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The impact of DCM on individual costs and QALYs was assessed by using multivariate regression models with interaction terms. Results: The probability of DCM being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of 40,000€ /QALY was higher in females (96% versus 16% for males), in those living alone (96% versus 26% for those living not alone), in those being moderately to severely cognitively (100% versus 3% for patients without cognitive impairment) and functionally impaired (97% versus 16% for patients without functional impairment), and in PwD having a high comorbidity (96% versus 26% for patients with a low comorbidity). Multivariate analyses revealed that females (b = -10,873; SE = 4,775, p = 0.023) who received the intervention had significantly lower healthcare cost. DCM significantly improved QALY for PwD with mild and moderate cognitive (b = +0.232, SE = 0.105) and functional deficits (b = +0.200, SE = 0.095). Conclusion: Patients characteristics significantly affect the cost-effectiveness. Females, patients living alone, patients with a high comorbidity, and those being moderately cognitively and functionally impaired benefit most from DCM.

For those subgroups, healthcare payers could gain the highest cost savings and the highest effects on QALYs when DCM will be implemented. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

A Subgroup Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Dementia care management (DCM) aims to provide optimal treatment for people with dementia (PwD). Treatment and care needs are dependent on patients'' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics and thus, economic outcomes could depend on such characteristics. Objective: To detect important subgroups that benefit most from DCM and for which a significant effect on cost, QALY, and the individual cost-effectiveness could be achieved. Methods: The analysis was based on 444 participants of the DelpHi-trial. For each subgroup, the probability of DCM being cost-effective was calculated and visualized using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The impact of DCM on individual costs and QALYs was assessed by using multivariate regression models with interaction terms. Results: The probability of DCM being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of 40,000€ /QALY was higher in females (96% versus 16% for males), in those living alone (96% versus 26% for those living not alone), in those being moderately to severely cognitively (100% versus 3% for patients without cognitive impairment) and functionally impaired (97% versus 16% for patients without functional impairment), and in PwD having a high comorbidity (96% versus 26% for patients with a low comorbidity). Multivariate analyses revealed that females (b = -10,873; SE = 4,775, p = 0.023) who received the intervention had significantly lower healthcare cost. DCM significantly improved QALY for PwD with mild and moderate cognitive (b = +0.232, SE = 0.105) and functional deficits (b = +0.200, SE = 0.095).

DCM significantly improved QALY for PwD with mild and moderate cognitive (b = +0.232, SE = 0.105) and functional deficits (b = +0.200, SE = 0.095). Conclusion: Patients characteristics significantly affect the cost-effectiveness. Females, patients living alone, patients with a high comorbidity, and those being moderately cognitively and functionally impaired benefit most from DCM. For those subgroups, healthcare payers could gain the highest cost savings and the highest effects on QALYs when DCM will be implemented. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Methods: The analysis was based on 444 participants of the DelpHi-trial. For each subgroup, the probability of DCM being cost-effective was calculated and visualized using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The impact of DCM on individual costs and QALYs was assessed by using multivariate regression models with interaction terms.

23467,Cost effectiveness of rituximab and mycophenolate mofetil for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in Thailand: Economic evaluation and budget impact analysis,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory condition of the central nervous system. The extent of disability depends on the severity of the disease and the number of relapses. Although azathioprine is currently the main treatment for patients with NMOSD in Thailand, patients often relapse during its use. Hence, it is argued that there are other drugs that would be more effective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate, from a societal perspective and from the economic impact on Thailand’s healthcare system, the cost utility of treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and rituximab in patients resistant to azathioprine. The Markov model with a one-year cycle length was applied to predict the health and cost outcomes in patients with NMOSD over a lifetime. The results showed that rituximab exhibited the highest quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains among all the options. Among the rituximab-based treatments, the administration of a rituximab biosimilar with CD27+ memory B cell monitoring proved to be the most cost-effective option. At the willingness-to-pay threshold of 160,000 Thai baht (THB), or 5,289 US dollar (USD), per QALY gained, the treatment exhibited the highest probability of being cost effective (48%). A sensitivity analysis based on the adjusted price of a generic MMF determined that the treatment was cost effective, exhibiting an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -164,653 THB (-5,443 USD) and a 32% probability of being cost effective. The calculated budget impact of treating patients resistant to conventional therapy was 1–6 million THB (33,000–198,000 USD) for the first three years, while after the third year, the budget impact stabilized at 3–4 million THB (99,000–132,000 USD). These data indicate that, in Thailand, treatment of drug resistant NMOSD with a rituximab biosimilar with CD27+ memory B cell monitoring or treatment with a generic MMF would be cost effective and would result in a low budget impact. Therefore, the inclusion of both the rituximab biosimilar and a generic MMF in the National Drug List of Essential Medicine for the treatment of NMOSD may be appropriate. © 2020 Aungsumart, Apiwattanakul.

23472,Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer with mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor in Colombia,"Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequences starting with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), afatinib and osimertinib, for the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive (Exon 19 deletion or L858R) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stages IIIB–IV in Colombia. Methods: A partitioned survival model was designed, using information from global and progression-free survival curves. For first and second-generation TKI, second line treatment was assumed according to the presence of T790M mutation to define the use of osimertinib or chemotherapy. The cost of the states without progression and post-progression was estimated using the base case approach, identified through consultation with clinical experts. Results: The cost of treatment starting with afatinib in the first line was of 222,247 USD (1 USD = 3171.99 COP) and produced 1.36 QALYs. The strategy with afatinib was dominant with respect to that of first line TKI (227,289 USD and 1.34 QALY). The strategy with osimertinib resulted in more QALYs and higher costs, with ICERs of 35,062 USD, exceeding the current willingness to pay threshold for Colombia. Conclusions: Treatment starting with afatinib in the first line is dominant with respect to the strategy with first line TKI.

23475,Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in advanced non-small cell lung cancer with mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor in Colombia,"Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequences starting with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), afatinib and osimertinib, for the treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive (Exon 19 deletion or L858R) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stages IIIB–IV in Colombia. Methods: A partitioned survival model was designed, using information from global and progression-free survival curves. For first and second-generation TKI, second line treatment was assumed according to the presence of T790M mutation to define the use of osimertinib or chemotherapy. The cost of the states without progression and post-progression was estimated using the base case approach, identified through consultation with clinical experts. Results: The cost of treatment starting with afatinib in the first line was of 222,247 USD (1 USD = 3171.99 COP) and produced 1.36 QALYs. The strategy with afatinib was dominant with respect to that of first line TKI (227,289 USD and 1.34 QALY). The strategy with osimertinib resulted in more QALYs and higher costs, with ICERs of 35,062 USD, exceeding the current willingness to pay threshold for Colombia. Conclusions: Treatment starting with afatinib in the first line is dominant with respect to the strategy with first line TKI. The ICER of osimertinib sequence exceeds the threshold when compared with afatinib one. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2020-01-33161,32498573,Expert Rev.

23476,Estimation of the clinical and economic impact of an improvement in adherence based on the use of once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy in patients with copd,"Background: Adherence to treatment is key to achieve desired outcomes. In COPD, adherence is generally suboptimal and is impaired by treatment complexity. Objective: To estimate the clinical and economic impact of an improvement in treatment adherence due to an increased use of once-daily single-inhaler triple therapy (SITT) in patients with COPD. Patients and Methods: A 7-state Markov model with monthly cycles was developed. Patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD, for whom triple therapy is indicated, were included. Outcomes and costs were estimated and compared for two scenarios: current distribution of adherent patients treated with multiple inhaler triple therapies (MITT) vs a potential scenario where patients shifted to once-daily SITT. In the potential scenario, adherence improvement due to once-daily SITT attributes was estimated. Costing was based on the Spanish National Health System (NHS) perspective (€2019). A 3-year time horizon was defined considering a 3% discount rate for both costs and outcomes. Results: A target population of 185,111 patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD currently treated with MITT was estimated. A 20% increase in the use of once-daily SITT in the potential scenario raised adherence up to 52%. This resulted in 6835 exacerbations and 532 deaths avoided, with 775 LYs and 594 QALYs gained. Total savings reached €7,082,105. Exacerbation reduction accounted for 61.8% (€4,378,201) of savings. Conclusion: Increasing the use of once-daily SITT in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD treated with triple therapy would be associated with an improvement in adherence, a reduction of exacerbations and deaths, and cost savings for the Spanish NHS. © 2020 Miravitlles et al.",2020-01-33165,0,Int.

23477,Cost-utility of an eHealth application ‘Oncokompas’ that supports cancer survivors in self-management: results of a randomised controlled trial,"Purpose: The eHealth self-management application ‘Oncokompas’ was developed to support cancer survivors in monitoring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptoms, and obtaining personalized feedback and options for supportive care. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-utility of Oncokompas compared with care as usual (CAU) among cancer survivors. Methods: Survivors were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Direct (non-)medical, indirect non-medical costs, and HRQOL were measured at 3- and 6-month follow-up, using iMTA Medical Consumption and Productivity Costs and the EuroQol-5D questionnaires. Mean cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were compared between both groups. Results: In total, 625 survivors were randomized into intervention (n = 320) or control group (n = 305). Base case analysis showed that incremental costs from a societal perspective were - €163 (95% CI, - 665 to 326), and incremental QALYs were 0.0017 (95% CI, - 0.0121 to 0.0155) in the intervention group compared with those in the control group. The probability that, compared with CAU, Oncokompas is more effective was 60%, less costly 73%, and both more effective and less costly 47%. Sensitivity analyses showed that incremental costs vary between - €40 and €69, and incremental QALYs vary between - 0.0023 and - 0.0057. Conclusion: Oncokompas is likely to be equally effective on utilities, and not more expensive than CAU, and will therefore contribute to sustainable cancer survivorship care in a (cost-)effective manner. Implications for Cancer Survivors: Oncokompas seems to improve HRQOL and reduces the burden of several tumour-specific symptoms, while costs from a societal perspective are similar to CAU. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020-01-33166,0,J.

23478,Modelling the Cost-Effectiveness of Indacaterol/Glycopyrronium versus Salmeterol/Fluticasone Using a Novel Markov Exacerbation-Based Approach,"Purpose: Exacerbations drive outcomes and costs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). While patient-level (micro) simulation cost-effectiveness models have been developed that include exacerbations, such models are complex. We developed a novel, exacerbation-based model to assess the cost-effectiveness of indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) versus salme- terol/fluticasone (SFC) in COPD, using a Markov structure as a simplification of a previously validated microsimulation model. Methods: The Markov model included three health states: infrequent or frequent exacer- bator (IE or FE; =1or=2 moderate/severe exacerbations in prior 12 months, respectively), or death. The model used data from the FLAME study and was run over a 10-year horizon. Cycle length was 1 year, after which patients remained in the same health state or transi- tioned to another. Analysis was conducted from a Swedish payer’s perspective (Swedish healthcare costs, converted into Euros), with incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) calculated (discounted 3% annually). Results: At all post-baseline timepoints, IND/GLY was associated with more patients in the IE health state and fewer patients in the FE and dead states relative to SFC. Over a 10-year period, IND/GLY was associated with a cost saving of €1,887/patient, an incremental benefit of 0.142 QALYs, and an addition of 0.057 life-years, compared with SFC. Conclusion: This Markov model represents a novel cost-effectiveness analysis for COPD, with simpler methodology than prior microsimulation models, while retaining exacerbations as drivers of disease progression. In patients with COPD with a history of exacerbations in the previous year, IND/GLY is a cost-effective treatment option compared with SFC. © 2020 Lakhotia et al.",2020-01-33167,32368025,Int. J.

23479,Cost-effectiveness of alectinib compared to crizotinib for the treatment of first-line ALK+ advanced non-small-cell lung cancer in France,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of alectinib for first-line treatment of ALK+ advanced non-small-cell lung cancer compared to crizotinib in the French setting. This study used a partitioned survival model, with three discrete health states (progression-free survival, post-progression survival and death). Survival probabilities were derived from a randomised Phase III clinical trial comparing alectinib to crizotinib (ALEX). Beyond the length of the trial (18 months), the efficacy of both treatments was considered equivalent. Occurrence of adverse events or brain metastases were considered as inter-current events. Utilities (and disutilities for intercurrent adverse events) derived from the EQ-5D were applied. Costs were attributed using standard French national public health tariffs. Projected mean overall survival was 4.62 years for alectinib and 4.18 years for crizotinib. Projected mean progression-free survival was 30.30 months for alectinib and 16.13 months for crizotinib. The total number of quality-adjusted life years projected was 3.40 for alectinib and 2.84 for crizotinib. The projected total cost of treatment over the lifetime of the model was € 246,022 for alectinib and € 195,486 for crizotinib. This extra cost was principally attributable to treatment acquisition costs and management before progression. Alectinib was associated with lower costs related to brain metastases and to management post-progression. The incremental cost per life year gained was 115,334 €/year and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 90,232 €/QALY. First-line treatment of ALK+ NSCLC with alectinib provides superior clinical outcomes to crizotinib and is cost-effective in the French context. © 2020 Sivignon et al.

23480,Patellofemoral arthroplasty is cheaper and more effective in the short term than total knee arthroplasty for isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis: cost-effectiveness analysis based on a randomized trial,"Aims The aim is to assess the cost-effectiveness of patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) in comparison with total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for the treatment of isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA) based on prospectively collected data on health outcomes and resource use from a blinded, randomized, clinical trial. Methods A total of 100 patients with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis were randomized to receive either PFA or TKA by experienced knee surgeons trained in using both implants. Patients completed patient-reported outcomes including EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) and 6-Item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaire (SF-6D) before the procedure. The scores were completed again after six weeks, three, six, and nine months, and again after one- and two-year post-surgery and yearly henceforth. Time-weighted outcome measures were constructed. Cost data were obtained from clinical registrations and patient-reported questionnaires. Incremental gain in health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)) and incremental costs were compared for the two groups of patients. Net monetary benefit was calculated assuming a threshold value of €10,000, €35,000, and €50,000 per QALY and used to test the statistical uncertainty and central assumptions about outcomes and costs. Results The PFA group had an incremental 12 month EQ-5D gain of 0.056 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.01 to 0.10) and an incremental 12 month cost of minus €328 (95% CI 836 to 180). PFA therefore dominates TKA by providing better and cheaper outcomes than TKA. The net monetary benefit of PFA was €887 (95% CI 324 to 1450) with the €10,000 threshold, and it was consistently positive when different measures of outcomes and different cost assumptions were used. Conclusion This study provides robust evidence that PFA from a one-year hospital management perspective is cheaper and provides better outcomes than TKA when applied to patients with isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis and performed by experienced knee surgeons. © 2020 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery.",2020-01-33174,32228074,Bone Jt.

23481,Cost-effectiveness of Dabigatran Compared With Rivaroxaban for Prevention of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation in China,"Purpose: In China, dabigatran and rivaroxaban are the only approved non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF). The goal of this article was to assess the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus rivaroxaban for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in Chinese patients with AF from the perspective of the Chinese health care system. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus rivaroxaban. Clinical events were modeled for a lifetime horizon, based on clinical efficacy data from indirect treatment comparisons. The weighted average of the most recent prices of these 2 drugs was used as the drug acquisition cost. Other costs, including follow-up costs and event costs, were collected by using a survey from a panel of local experts. Utility inputs (health state utilities, clinical event disutilities, and event history utility) were obtained from published literature. Sensitivity analyses that included scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted to examine the robustness of the economic model. Findings: Over a lifetime, patients treated with dabigatran experienced fewer ischemic strokes (2.14 dabigatran vs 2.61 rivaroxaban) and fewer intracranial hemorrhage (0.48 vs 0.94) per 100 patient-years. In the base case analysis, dabigatran had an incremental cost of ¥28,128 but with higher life years (10.38 vs 10.14) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (7.95 vs 7.70). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ¥112,910 per QALY gained and net monetary benefit of ¥12,214 versus rivaroxaban showed that dabigatran was a cost-effective alternative to rivaroxaban. Extensive sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust over a wide range of inputs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that dabigatran was cost-effective in 84.2% of the 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations compared with rivaroxaban. Implications: Dabigatran reduced the occurrence of clinical events and increased QALYs compared with rivaroxaban.

23482,"Concurrent cisplatin or cetuximab with radiotherapy for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer: Medical resource use, costs, and quality-adjusted survival from the De-ESCALaTE HPV trial","Background: The De-ESCALaTE HPV trial confirmed the dominance of cisplatin over cetuximab for tumour control in patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Here, we present the analysis of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), resource use, and health care costs in the trial, as well as complete 2-year survival and recurrence. Materials and methods: Resource use and HRQoL data were collected at intervals from the baseline to 24 months post treatment (PT). Health care costs were estimated using UK-based unit costs. Missing data were imputed. Differences in mean EQ-5D-5L utility index and adjusted cumulative quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and linear regression, respectively. Mean resource usage and costs were compared through two-sample t-tests. Results: 334 patients were randomised to cisplatin (n = 166) or cetuximab (n = 168). Two-year overall survival (97·5% vs 90·0%, HR: 3.268 [95% CI 1·451 to 7·359], p = 0·0251) and recurrence rates (6·4% vs 16·0%, HR: 2·67 [1·38 to 5·15]; p = 0·0024) favoured cisplatin. No significant differences in EQ-5D-5L utility scores were detected at any time point. At 24 months PT, mean difference was 0·107 QALYs in favour of cisplatin (95% CI: 0·186 to 0·029, p = 0·007) driven by the mortality difference. Health care costs were similar across all categories except the procurement cost and delivery of the systemic agent, with cetuximab significantly more expensive than cisplatin (£7779 [P < 0.001]). Consequently, total costs at 24 months PT averaged £13517 (SE: £345) per patient for cisplatin and £21064 (SE: £400) for cetuximab (mean difference £7547 [95% CI: £6512 to £8582]).

The cost-effectiveness of CT angiography in patients with minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score =6) is not well established. Purpose: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of CT angiography in the detection of large-vessel occlusion (LVO) in patients with acute minor stroke (NIHSS score =6). Materials and Methods: A Markov decision-analytic model with a societal perspective was constructed. Three different management strategies were evaluated: (a) no vascular imaging and best medical management, (b) CT angiography for all patients and immediate thrombectomy for LVO after intravenous thrombolysis, and (c) CT angiography for all and best medical management (including intravenous thrombolysis, with rescue thrombectomy for patients with LVO and neurologic deterioration). One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Base-case calculation showed that CT angiography followed by immediate thrombectomy had the lowest cost ($346 007) and highest health benefits (9.26 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]). CT angiography followed by best medical management with possible rescue thrombectomy for patients with LVO had a slightly higher cost ($346 500) and lower health benefits (9.09 QALYs). No vascular imaging had the highest cost and lowest health benefits. The difference in health benefits compared with the CT angiography and immediate thrombectomy strategy was 0.39 QALY, which corresponds to 142 days in perfect health per patient.

23485,"Estimating the costs and cost-effectiveness of HIV self-testing among men who have sex with men, United States","Introduction: HIV testing is an essential prerequisite for accessing treatment with antiretroviral therapy or prevention using pre-exposure prophylaxis. Internet distribution of HIV self-tests is a novel approach, and data on the programmatic cost of this approach are limited. We analyse the costs and cost-effectiveness of a self-testing programme. Methods: Men who have sex with men (MSM) reporting unknown or negative HIV status were enrolled from March to August 2015 into a 12-month trial of HIV self-testing in the United States. Participants were randomly assigned either to the self-testing arm or the control arm. All participants received information on HIV testing services and locations in their community. Self-testing participants received up to four self-tests each quarter, which they could use themselves or distribute to their social network associates. Quarterly follow-up surveys collected testing outcomes, including number of tests used and new HIV diagnoses. Using trial expenditure data, we estimated the cost of implementing a self-testing programme. Primary outcomes of this analysis included total programme implementation costs, cost per self-test completed, cost per person tested, cost per new HIV diagnosis among those self-tested and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved. Results: A total of 2665 men were assigned either to the self-testing arm (n = 1325) or the control arm (n = 1340). HIV testing was reported by 971 self-testing participants who completed a total of 5368 tests. In the control arm, 619 participants completed 1463 HIV tests. The self-testing participants additionally distributed 2864 self-tests to 2152 social network associates. Testing during the trial identified 59 participants and social network associates with newly diagnosed HIV infection in the self-testing arm; 11 control participants were newly diagnosed with HIV. The implementation cost of the HIV self-testing programme was $449,510. The cost per self-test completed, cost per person tested at least once, and incremental cost per new HIV diagnosis was $61, $145 and $9365 respectively. We estimated that self-testing programme potentially averted 3.34 transmissions, saved 14.86 QALYs and nearly $1.6 million lifetime HIV treatment costs. Conclusions: The HIV self-testing programme identified persons with newly diagnosed HIV infection at low cost, and the programme is cost saving. © 2020 The Authors.

23486,An economic evaluation examining the cost-effectiveness of continuous diffusion of oxygen therapy for individuals with diabetic foot ulcers,"Continuous delivery of oxygen therapy has been observed to improve healing for individuals with an advanced diabetic foot ulcer (DFU). However, this intervention requires the purchasing of an oxygen delivery device and moist dressings. It is unknown whether this upfront financial investment represents good value for money. Thus the aim of this project is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treating advanced DFU using continuous delivery of oxygen compared with negative pressure wound therapy from the perspective of the public health care payer in Ontario, Canada. A microsimulation model was constructed with inputs from peer-reviewed journal publications and publicly available reports. The 5-year costs and quality-adjusted life-years were compared between treatment and comparator. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the robustness of results. The model predicted that continuous delivery of oxygen would cost $4800 less compared with negative pressure wound therapy and increased quality-adjusted life years by 0.025. Lower cost and improved outcomes were observed in most scenario analyses. The results of this economic evaluation suggest that CDO therapy may reduce health care economic burden with a modest increase in quality of life outcomes. Health care decision-makers should consider the inclusion of CDO for the treatment of DFU.",2020-01-33190,0,Int Wound J,C Chan,2020,/,-,No,Not Stated,"C Chan; E Campbell; An economic evaluation examining the cost-effectiveness of continuous diffusion of oxygen therapy for individuals with diabetic foot ulcers, Int Wound J, 2020; ():1742-481X; -",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Medical Procedure,continuous delivery of oxygen therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- negative pressure wound therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"5 Years, 1, 2, 10",1.50,1.50,-192000,Canada,2019,-146475.84
23487,An Economic Evaluation of the Cost-Effectiveness of Opt-Out Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C Testing in an Emergency Department Setting in the United Kingdom,"Objectives: The prevalence of hepatitis is high in emergency department (ED) attendees in the United Kingdom, with a prevalence of up to 2% for hepatitis B (HBV) HBsAg, and 2.9% for hepatitis C (HCV) RNA. The aim of this paper is to perform an economic evaluation of opt-out ED-based HCV and HBV testing. Methods: A Markov model was developed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of opt-out HCV and HBV testing in EDs in the UK. The model used data from UK studies of ED testing to parameterize the HCV and HBV prevalence (1.4% HCV RNA, 0.84% HBsAg), test costs, and intervention effects (contact rates and linkage to care). For HCV, we used an antibody test cost of £3.64 and RNA test cost of £68.38, and assumed direct-acting antiviral treatment costs of £10 000. For HBV, we used a combined HBsAg and confirmatory test cost of £5.79. We also modeled the minimum prevalence of HCV (RNA-positive) and HBV (HBsAg) required to make ED testing cost-effective at a £20 000 willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life-year threshold. Results: In the base case, ED testing was highly cost-effective, with HCV and HBV testing costing £8019 and £9858 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. HCV and HBV ED testing remained cost-effective at 0.25% HCV RNA or HBsAg prevalence or higher. Conclusions: Emergency department testing for HCV and HBV is highly likely to be cost-effective in many areas across the UK depending on their prevalence.

23489,Cost-utility analysis comparing surgical and nonsurgical interventions in the treatment of erectile dysfunction,"Background: With recent innovative developments in microsurgery, novel, safe, and effective surgical options for erectile dysfunction (ED) are quickly emerging which may replace mainstay medical treatments. In an age where health care is increasingly focused on financial accountability and clinical outcomes, cost-utility analysis between nonsurgical treatment (pharmaceutical agents, mechanical devices, and shockwave therapy) and emerging surgical options will prove relevant and impactful to all physicians that treat patients with ED. The purpose of this study was to use the cost-utility analysis to compare the costs, outcomes, and overall quality of life conveyed to the patient by either nonsurgical or surgical treatments for ED. These results will help patients and physicians form more informed decisions when it comes to the treatment of men suffering from ED. Methods: The cost-utility analysis makes use of costs, probabilities, and utilities of health outcomes (referred to as health states) that are used to evaluate opposing interventions. Amazon Mechanical Turk© was used to derive utility scores for health states associated with surgical and nonsurgical interventions. In addition, a systematic review was performed to identify common complications of treatment and associated probabilities. All direct costs were derived from national Medicare facility reimbursement data and national hospital billing charges for fiscal year 2017, and indirect costs were accounted for by our utility estimates. Results: Baseline analysis revealed an incremental cost-utility ratio of $(1428.00) in favor of surgical intervention. The cost of lifetime medical therapy was $15,488.28 greater than that of surgery even when adjusted for inflation. Furthermore, surgery provided patients with a quality-adjusted life-year gain of 10.77 years greater than medical treatment. Conclusions: Long-term costs and utility data should be taken into consideration when determining the best treatment options for a patient with ED.

23493,Cost-Utility Analysis of Direct-Acting Antivirals for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1 and 6 in Vietnam,"Objective: Very few cost-utility analyses have either evaluated direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 patients or undertaken societal perspective. Recently, DAAs have been introduced into the Vietnamese health insurance drug list for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) treatment without empirical cost-effectiveness evidence. This study was conducted to generate these data on DAAs among CHC patients with genotypes 1 and 6 in Vietnam. Methods: A hybrid decision-tree and Markov model was employed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of available DAAs, including (1) sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, (2) sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and (3) sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir, with pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin (PR). Primary data collection was conducted in Vietnam to identify costs and utility values. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated from societal and payer perspectives. Uncertainty and scenario analyses and value of information analyses were performed. Results: All DAAs were cost-saving as compared with PR in CHC patients with genotypes 1 and 6 in Vietnam, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was the most cost-saving regimen, from both societal and payer perspectives. From the societal perspective, DAAs were associated with the increment of quality-adjusted life-years by 1.33 to 1.35 and decrement of costs by $6519 to $7246. Uncertainty and scenario analyses confirmed the robustness of base-case results, whereas the value of information analyses suggested the need for further research on relative treatment efficacies among DAA regimens.

23498,Cost-Utility Analysis of Direct-Acting Antivirals for Treatment of Chronic Hepatitis C Genotype 1 and 6 in Vietnam,"Objective: Very few cost-utility analyses have either evaluated direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) on hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 6 patients or undertaken societal perspective. Recently, DAAs have been introduced into the Vietnamese health insurance drug list for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) treatment without empirical cost-effectiveness evidence. This study was conducted to generate these data on DAAs among CHC patients with genotypes 1 and 6 in Vietnam. Methods: A hybrid decision-tree and Markov model was employed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of available DAAs, including (1) sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, (2) sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, and (3) sofosbuvir plus daclatasvir, with pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin (PR). Primary data collection was conducted in Vietnam to identify costs and utility values. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated from societal and payer perspectives. Uncertainty and scenario analyses and value of information analyses were performed. Results: All DAAs were cost-saving as compared with PR in CHC patients with genotypes 1 and 6 in Vietnam, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir was the most cost-saving regimen, from both societal and payer perspectives. From the societal perspective, DAAs were associated with the increment of quality-adjusted life-years by 1.33 to 1.35 and decrement of costs by $6519 to $7246. Uncertainty and scenario analyses confirmed the robustness of base-case results, whereas the value of information analyses suggested the need for further research on relative treatment efficacies among DAA regimens. Conclusions: Allocating resources for DAA treatment for HCV genotype 1 and 6 is surely a rewarding public health investment in Vietnam.

23499,Early Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Electrochemotherapy as a Prospect Treatment Modality for Skin Melanoma,"PURPOSE: Electrochemotherapy is increasingly entering into national and international guidelines, requiring formal evaluation of treatment costs and cost-effectiveness to ensure that its uptake provides value to budget-constrained health care systems. This study analyzed the early cost-effectiveness of electrochemotherapy in patients with Stage IIIc/IV skin melanoma in clinical practice in Slovenia. The costs of electrochemotherapy were compared to those of the standard of care, consisting of palliative treatment and therapy for symptoms. METHODS: wThe study enrolled 23 patients treated with electrochemotherapy at the Institute of Oncology (Ljubljana, Slovenia). The mean cost of electrochemotherapy was estimated using patient-specific cost data on electrochemotherapy procedures and subsequent follow-up. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated by collecting EQ-5D-3L questionnaires at baseline, after complete or partial response following the treatment, and after a relapse of skin lesions. A discrete-time Markov model was built to estimate the lifetime costs and consequences of using electrochemotherapy compared to standard of care, from the perspective of the Slovenian health care system. The analysis was conducted separately in the whole patient sample and in the subset of patients with bleeding lesions. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test model assumptions and to characterize the uncertainty around model parameters. FINDINGS: In the whole patient population, electrochemotherapy for skin melanoma Stage IIIc/IV was expected to increase QALYs by 0.29 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.10-0.50), at the higher cost of 6568 EUR (95% CrI, 4593-8928) in comparison to the standard of care. At the cost-effectiveness threshold of 20,000 EUR/QALY, the estimated probabilities of electrochemotherapy being cost-effective compared to standard of care were 0.30 and 0.91 in the whole patient sample and in patients with bleeding lesions, respectively. In the whole sample population, a 50% reduction in the price of the electrodes was expected to increase the probability of electrochemotherapy being cost-effective from 0.30 to ~0.64. IMPLICATIONS: The findings from this cost-effectiveness analysis of data from clinical practice were based on a small sample size (ie, 23 patents), which made the subgroup of patients with bleeding lesions very small. Therefore, the findings in this patient population should be carefully interpreted. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2020-01-33274,0,npj Digit.
