6401,Cost-effectiveness of CT and PET-CT for determining the need for adjuvant neck dissection in locally advanced head and neck cancer,"BACKGROUND: Patients with node-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNC) have a significant risk of residual disease (RD) in the neck after treatment, despite optimal chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Adjuvant neck dissection (ND) after CRT has been considered standard treatment, but its morbidity has led investigators to consider using post-CRT imaging to determine the need for surgery. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) as predictors of the need for ND compared with ND for all patients. Materials and methods: We developed a Markov model to describe health states in the 5 years after CRT for HNC in a 50-year-old man. We compared three strategies: dissect all patients, dissect patients with RD on CT, and dissect patients with RD on PET-CT. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out to model uncertainty in PET-CT performance, up-front and salvage dissection costs, and patient utilities. RESULTS: ND only for patients with RD on PET-CT was the dominant strategy over a wide range of realistic and exaggerated assumptions. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed that the PET-CT strategy was almost certainly cost-effective at a societal willingness-to-pay threshold of $500 000/quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant ND reserved for patients with RD on PET-CT is the dominant and cost-effective strategy.",2009-01-05873,19833820,Ann Oncol,D J Sher,2009,/,,No,19833820,"D J Sher; Cost-effectiveness of CT and PET-CT for determining the need for adjuvant neck dissection in locally advanced head and neck cancer, Ann Oncol, 2009-Oct-15; ():0923-7534",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dissect patients with residual disease on positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) vs. Dissect all patients,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2006,Not Stated
6402,Cost-effectiveness of an intervention to reduce emergency re-admissions to hospital among older patients,"BACKGROUND: The objective is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an intervention that reduces hospital re-admission among older people at high risk. A cost-effectiveness model to estimate the costs and health benefits of the intervention was implemented. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The model used data from a randomised controlled trial conducted in an Australian tertiary metropolitan hospital. Participants were acute medical admissions aged >65 years with at least one risk factor for re-admission: multiple comorbidities, impaired functionality, aged >75 years, recent multiple admissions, poor social support, history of depression. The intervention was a comprehensive nursing and physiotherapy assessment and an individually tailored program of exercise strategies and nurse home visits with telephone follow-up; commencing in hospital and continuing following discharge for 24 weeks. The change to cost outcomes, including the costs of implementing the intervention and all subsequent use of health care services, and, the change to health benefits, represented by quality adjusted life years, were estimated for the intervention as compared to existing practice. The mean change to total costs and quality adjusted life years for an average individual over 24 weeks participating in the intervention were: cost savings of $333 (95% Bayesian credible interval $ -1,932:1,282) and 0.118 extra quality adjusted life years (95% Bayesian credible interval 0.1:0.136). The mean net-monetary-benefit per individual for the intervention group compared to the usual care condition was $7,907 (95% Bayesian credible interval $5,959:$9,995) for the 24 week period. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The estimation model that describes this intervention predicts cost savings and improved health outcomes. A decision to remain with existing practices causes unnecessary costs and reduced health. Decision makers should consider adopting this program for elderly hospitalised patients.",2009-01-05875,19829702,PLoS One,Nicholas Graves,2009,4 / 10,e7455,No,19829702,"Nicholas Graves; Cost-effectiveness of an intervention to reduce emergency re-admissions to hospital among older patients, PLoS One , 2009; 4(10):1932-6203; e7455",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Comprehensive nursing and physiotherapy assessment and an individually tailored program of exercise strategies and nurse home visits with telephone follow-up; commencing in hospital and continuing following discharge for 24 weeks. vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,66 Years,"Female, Male",Full,24 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2822.03,Australia,2008,-2896.01
6403,Intervention study shows outpatient cardiac rehabilitation to be economically at least as attractive as inpatient rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: Since the late 1990s, cost pressure has led to a growing interest in outpatient rehabilitation in Germany where predominantly inpatient rehabilitation has been provided. Taking into account the feasibility of a randomized design, the aim of this study was to compare outpatient and inpatient cardiac rehabilitation from a societal perspective. METHOD: A comprehensive cohort design was applied. Costs during rehabilitation were measured using individual documentation of the rehabilitation centers. Economic end points were quality of life (EQ-5D), and total direct and indirect costs. A propensity score approach, integrated into a simultaneous regression framework for cost and effects, was used to control for selection bias. Bootstrap analysis was applied for assessing uncertainty in cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: A total of 163 patients were included in the study (112 inpatients, 51 outpatients). As randomization was chosen by only 2.5% of participants, the study had to be analyzed as an observational study. Direct costs during inpatient rehabilitation were significantly higher by 600 <euro> (+/-318; p < 0.001) compared to outpatient rehabilitation (2,016 <euro> +/- 354 <euro> vs. 1,416 <euro> +/- 315), while there was no significant difference in health-related quality of life. Over the 12-month follow-up period, adjusted costs difference in total cost was estimated at -2,895 <euro> (p = 0.102) and adjusted difference in effects at 0.018 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (n.s.) in favor of outpatient treatment. CONCLUSION: The ratio of mean cost over mean effect difference (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) indicates dominance of outpatient rehabilitation, but at a considerable statistical uncertainty. However, outpatient rehabilitation cannot be rejected from an economic perspective.",2009-01-05882,19821135,Clin Res Cardiol,Bernd Schweikert,2009,/,,No,19821135,"Bernd Schweikert; Intervention study shows outpatient cardiac rehabilitation to be economically at least as attractive as inpatient rehabilitation, Clin Res Cardiol, 2009-Oct-11; ():1861-0684",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Outpatient rehabilitation vs. Inpatient rehabiliation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-33333.34,Euro,2006,-53760.32
6404,The cost-effectiveness of Maze procedures using ablation techniques at the time of mitral valve surgery,"BACKGROUND: The classic cut and sew surgical Maze procedure has been shown to reduce atrial fibrillation (AF), and recently newer surgical ablation techniques with reduced technical complexity have been introduced. This study sought to systematically review the efficacy and safety of these newer techniques and to evaluate their long-term cost-effectiveness at the time of scheduled mitral valve (MV) surgery. METHODS: A systematic literature search and meta-analysis was performed to generate the most reliable efficacy and safety parameter estimates for a Markov decision analysis model comparing MV surgery alone to MV surgery plus an ablation Maze procedure. Both basic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Based on the six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) identified, the pooled 1-year estimate of AF after surgery alone was 71 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 64 percent to 78 percent). The pooled risk ratio of AF after surgical ablation treatment at the time of mitral valve surgery relative to valve surgery alone was 0.33 (95 percent CI, 0.19 to 0.55). The pooled analyses showed that no statistical significant increases in operative mortality, permanent pacemaker implantation, and postoperative bleeding with the ablative Maze procedures. An ablation-based Maze procedure at the time of mitral valve surgery had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $4,446CAD ($3,850US) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with valve surgery alone. Specifically costs were an extra $900CAD but with improved clinical outcomes (0.20 QALYs), including a prolonged life expectancy of 0.10 life-years. In one-way sensitivity analyses, survival time after MV surgery had the largest impact on ICER. Other variables influencing the ICER included the risk ratio of AF, utility, and cost estimates. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that 58.1 percent, 73.9 percent, and 89.3 percent of the simulations of the Maze strategy are cost-effective at willingness to pay thresholds of $20,000, $50,000, and $100,000CAD per QALY gained, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that a Maze surgical ablation procedure at the time of MV surgery is associated with a reduced postoperative AF risk. Our economic model further suggests that the surgical ablation strategy at the time of mitral valve surgery is likely a cost-effective intervention, provided patients have a good long-term postsurgical prognosis.",2009-01-05886,19818194,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Stéphane P Quenneville,2009,25 / 4,485-96,No,19818194,"Stéphane P Quenneville; The cost-effectiveness of Maze procedures using ablation techniques at the time of mitral valve surgery, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2009-Oct; 25(4):0266-4623; 485-96",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mitral valve surgery plus an ablation Maze procedure vs. Mitral valve surgery only,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,4446,Canada,2007,5194.19
6405,Cost-Effectiveness of Using Recombinant Human Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone before Radioiodine Ablation for Thyroid Cancer: The Canadian Perspective,"ABSTRACT Objectives: Radioiodine ablation for the treatment of thyroid cancer is traditionally performed after preparing patients by inducing hypothyroidism. Exogenous stimulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) using recombinant human TSH (rhTSH) avoids hypothyroidism and hastens the clearance of radioiodine from the patient. These advantages are achieved without jeopardizing the success rate of remnant ablation. An economic analysis was performed to place the increased acquisition cost of rhTSH in the context of the health benefits achieved and the earlier discharge from radioprotection. Methods: Markov modeling, using 17 individual weekly cycles, was used to assess the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) associated with exogenous stimulation. Clinical inputs were largely sourced from a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing remnant ablation success after either rhTSH or hypothyroid preparation. The model applied Canadian unit costs, taking a societal perspective. Additional costs associated with rhTSH were considered in the context of the clinical benefits and cost offsets. These included avoidance of hypothyroidism, increased work productivity, earlier administration of ablation after surgery, and earlier discharge from the radio-protective ward because of faster radioiodine clearance following rhTSH preparation. The model duration avoided the need for discounting. Results: The additional benefits of rhTSH (0.0576 QALY) are obtained with an incremental cost of CD$N87, generating an incremental cost per QALY of CDN$1520. Deterministic one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated the result to be robust. Conclusions: The use of rhTSH before radioiodine ablation represents a reasonable allocation of costs, with the benefits to patients, hospitals, and society as a whole, obtained at modest cost.",2009-01-05887,19818064,Value Health,Paul Mernagh,2009,/,,Yes,19818064,"Paul Mernagh; Cost-Effectiveness of Using Recombinant Human Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone before Radioiodine Ablation for Thyroid Cancer: The Canadian Perspective, Value Health, 2009-Oct-08; ():1098-3015",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Recombinant human thyroid stimulating hormone (rhTSH) before radioidine ablation vs. No recombinant human thryoid stimulating hormone (rhTSH),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,17 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,1520,Canada,2008,1725.13

6407,Cost-effectiveness of treating resistant hypertension with an implantable carotid body stimulator,"The purposes of this study are to investigate the cost-effectiveness of an implantable carotid body stimulator (Rheos; CVRx, Inc, Minneapolis, MN) for treating resistant hypertension and determine the range of starting systolic blood pressure (SBP) values where the device remains cost-effective. A Markov model compared a 20-mm Hg drop in SBP from an initial level of 180 mm Hg with Rheos to failed medical management in a hypothetical 50-year-old cohort. Direct costs (2007$), utilities, and event rates for future myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, and end-stage renal disease were modeled. Sensitivity analyses tested the assumptions in the model. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Rheos was $64,400 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using Framingham-derived event probabilities. The ICER was <$100,000 per QALYs for SBPs > or =142 mm Hg. A probability of device removal of <1% per year or SBP reductions of > or =24 mm Hg were variables that decreased the ICER below $50,000 per QALY. For cohort characteristics similar to Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Blood Pressure-Lowering Arm (ASCOT-BPLA) participants, the ICER became $26,700 per QALY. Two-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated that lowering SBP 12 mm Hg from 220 mm Hg or 21 mm Hg from 140 mm Hg were required.

6410,Cost effectiveness analysis of including boys in a human papillomavirus vaccination programme in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of including preadolescent boys in a routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme for preadolescent girls. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective. SETTING: United States. POPULATION: Girls and boys aged 12 years. INTERVENTIONS: HPV vaccination of girls alone and of girls and boys in the context of screening for cervical cancer. Main outcome measure Incremental cost effectiveness ratios, expressed as cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: With 75% vaccination coverage and an assumption of complete, lifelong vaccine efficacy, routine HPV vaccination of 12 year old girls was consistently less than $50,000 per QALY gained compared with screening alone. Including preadolescent boys in a routine vaccination programme for preadolescent girls resulted in higher costs and benefits and generally had cost effectiveness ratios that exceeded $100,000 per QALY across a range of HPV related outcomes, scenarios for cervical cancer screening, and assumptions of vaccine efficacy and duration. Vaccinating both girls and boys fell below a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY only under scenarios of high, lifelong vaccine efficacy against all HPV related diseases (including other non-cervical cancers and genital warts), or scenarios of lower efficacy with lower coverage or lower vaccine costs.

6414,Cost effectiveness analysis of including boys in a human papillomavirus vaccination programme in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of including preadolescent boys in a routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme for preadolescent girls. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective. SETTING: United States. POPULATION: Girls and boys aged 12 years. INTERVENTIONS: HPV vaccination of girls alone and of girls and boys in the context of screening for cervical cancer. Main outcome measure Incremental cost effectiveness ratios, expressed as cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: With 75% vaccination coverage and an assumption of complete, lifelong vaccine efficacy, routine HPV vaccination of 12 year old girls was consistently less than $50,000 per QALY gained compared with screening alone. Including preadolescent boys in a routine vaccination programme for preadolescent girls resulted in higher costs and benefits and generally had cost effectiveness ratios that exceeded $100,000 per QALY across a range of HPV related outcomes, scenarios for cervical cancer screening, and assumptions of vaccine efficacy and duration. Vaccinating both girls and boys fell below a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY only under scenarios of high, lifelong vaccine efficacy against all HPV related diseases (including other non-cervical cancers and genital warts), or scenarios of lower efficacy with lower coverage or lower vaccine costs. CONCLUSIONS: Given currently available information, including boys in an HPV vaccination programme generally exceeds conventional thresholds of good value for money, even under favourable conditions of vaccine protection and health benefits.

6415,Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pegvisomant for the treatment of acromegaly: a systematic review and economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Acromegaly, an orphan disease usually caused by a benign pituitary tumour, is characterised by hyper-secretion of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1). It is associated with reduced life expectancy, cardiovascular problems, a variety of insidiously progressing detrimental symptoms and metabolic malfunction. Treatments include surgery, radiotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Pegvisomant (PEG) is a genetically engineered GH analogue licensed as a third or fourth line option when other treatments have failed to normalise IGF-1 levels. METHODS: Evidence about effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PEG was systematically reviewed. Data were extracted from published studies and used for a narrative synthesis of evidence. A decision analytical economic model was identified and modified to assess the cost-effectiveness of PEG. RESULTS: One RCT and 17 non-randomised studies were reviewed for effectiveness. PEG substantially reduced and rapidly normalised IGF-1 levels in the majority of patients, approximately doubled GH levels, and improved some of the signs and symptoms of the disease. Tumour size was unaffected at least in the short term. PEG had a generally safe adverse event profile but a few patients were withdrawn from treatment because of raised liver enzymes. An economic model was identified and adapted to estimate the lower limit for the cost-effectiveness of PEG treatment versus standard care. Over a 20 year time horizon the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound81,000/QALY and pound212,000/LYG. To reduce this to pound30K/QALY would require a reduction in drug cost by about one third. CONCLUSION: PEG is highly effective for improving patients' IGF-1 level. Signs and symptoms of disease improve but evidence is lacking about long term effects on improved signs and symptoms of disease, quality of life, patient compliance and safety. Economic evaluation indicated that if current standards (UK) for determining cost-effectiveness of therapies were to be applied to PEG it would be considered not to represent good value for money.",2009-01-05897,19814797,BMC Endocr Disord,David J Moore,2009,9 /,20,No,19814797,"David J Moore; Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pegvisomant for the treatment of acromegaly: a systematic review and economic evaluation, BMC Endocr Disord, 2009; 9():1472-6823; 20",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pegvisomant (PEG) vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,20 Years,3.50,3.50,81000,United Kingdom,2007,202415.74
6416,Cost-utility of treatment of bulimia nervosa,"OBJECTIVE:: The costs of treating eating disorders are high. Our objective was to perform a cost-utility analysis of treatment of bulimia nervosa. METHOD:: 72 patients entering treatment of bulimia nervosa (ICD-10 diagnosis) completed the 15D health-related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) before and 6 months after the start of treatment. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were calculated and cost-utility was assessed within the time horizon of 10 years. RESULTS:: Baseline HRQoL was severely impaired in the patients. As a consequence of treatment, mean HRQoL improved clinically and statistically significantly. The cost per QALY gained varied from euro1,455 to euro16,481 (from euro4,428 to euro19,663 discounted at 5%) depending on the assumptions used in the analysis. DISCUSSION:: HRQoL of bulimia nervosa patients is severely impaired, but treatment has a clear positive effect on HRQoL. The cost per QALY gained is comparable to many other treatments.

6419,Cost-effectiveness of ruling out deep venous thrombosis in primary care versus care as usual,"BACKGROUND: Referral for ultrasound testing in all patients suspected of DVT is inefficient, because 80-90% have no DVT. Objective: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of a diagnostic strategy to select patients at first presentation in primary care based on a point of care D-dimer test combined with a clinical decision rule (AMUSE strategy), compared with hospital-based strategies. PATIENTS/METHODS: A Markov-type cost-effectiveness model with a societal perspective and a 5-year time horizon was used to compare the AMUSE strategy with hospital-based strategies.

6423,Randomized controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis of silver-donating antimicrobial dressings for venous leg ulcers (VULCAN trial),"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial silver dressings are used beneath graduated compression in the treatment of venous ulceration. There is little information on whether their use is effective. This was a prospective randomized trial and cost-effectiveness analysis of silver-donating versus non-silver low-adherence dressings in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. METHODS: Patients were randomized between the two types of dressing. The primary outcome measure was complete ulcer healing at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included time to healing, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were recruited. There was no difference between the dressings in the proportion of ulcers healed at 12 weeks (59.6 per cent for silver and 56.7 per cent for control dressings). Mean utility scores for the EuroQol 5D and Short Form 6D were similar in both groups at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Compared with the control group the antimicrobial group had an incremental cost of pounds sterling 97.85 and an incremental quality-adjusted life year gain of 0.0002, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pounds sterling 489 250 for the antimicrobial dressings. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found in either primary or secondary endpoints. There was no evidence to support the routine use of silver-donating dressings beneath compression for venous ulceration.

BACKGROUND: The ExTRACT-TIMI 25 (Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 25) study, a large, randomized, multinational trial, demonstrated a reduction in death or nonfatal myocardial infarction when enoxaparin was used instead of UFH as adjunctive therapy for fibrinolysis in patients with STEMI. METHODS: We used patient-level clinical outcomes and resource use from the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 trial and estimates of life expectancy gains as a result of the prevention of the clinical events on the basis of the Framingham Heart Study. RESULTS: Index hospitalization costs trended lower by $126 in the enoxaparin group (95% confidence interval [CI]: -$295 to $49). Thirty-day costs trended higher by $102 for enoxaparin (95% CI: $108 to $314). Patients receiving enoxaparin gained an average of 0.12 life-years relative to patients given UFH. Estimated total lifetime costs were $1,207 higher in the enoxaparin group (95% CI: $491 to $1,923). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of enoxaparin compared with UFH was $5,700 per life-year gained, with 99.9% of bootstrap-derived estimates <$50,000 per life-year gained. Using a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there is a 90% probability that enoxaparin is cost effective for lifetime, provided that the willingness-to-pay value exceeds $50,000.

6425,Cost-effectiveness of a potential prophylactic Helicobacter pylori vaccine in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori vaccines are under development to prevent infection. We quantified the cost-effectiveness of such a vaccine in the United States, using a dynamic transmission model. METHODS: We compartmentalized the population by age, infection status, and clinical disease state and measured effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We simulated no intervention, vaccination of infants, and vaccination of school-age children. Variables included costs of vaccine, vaccine administration, and gastric cancer treatment (in 2007 US dollars), vaccine efficacy, quality adjustment due to gastric cancer, and discount rate. We evaluated possible outcomes for periods of 10-75 years. RESULTS: H. pylori vaccination of infants would cost $2.9 billion over 10 years; savings from cancer prevention would be realized decades later. Over a long time horizon (75 years), incremental costs of H. pylori vaccination would be $1.8 billion, and incremental QALYs would be 0.5 million, yielding a cost-effectiveness ratio of $3871/QALY.

6427,Cost utility of docetaxel as induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck,"BACKGROUND: Trial TAX 324 showed that induction chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF) compared with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (PF) followed by chemoradiation increases survival and time to progression in squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN). METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of induction chemotherapy with docetaxel in the United Kingdom from the payer perspective. Health states were based on the WHO criteria for objective response to cancer treatments. Efficacy and safety data were obtained from the trial. Resource utilization, costs, and utility data were primarily derived from the literature. RESULTS: A patient on TPF gained 4.1 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) versus 2.0 QALYs for PF patient. Corresponding lifetime costs were pound 32,440 and pound 28,718. The cost per QALY gained for TPF versus PF was pound 1782.

6433,Modeling the value for money of changing clinical practice change: a stochastic application in diabetes care,"BACKGROUND: Decision making about resource allocation for guideline implementation to change clinical practice is inevitably undertaken in a context of uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness of both clinical guidelines and implementation strategies. Adopting a total net benefit approach, a model was recently developed to overcome problems with the use of combined ratio statistics when analyzing decision uncertainty. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the stochastic application of the model for informing decision making about the adoption of an audit and feedback strategy for implementing a guideline recommending intensive blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes in primary care in the Netherlands. METHODS: An integrated Bayesian approach to decision modeling and evidence synthesis is adopted, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation in WinBUGs. Data on model parameters is gathered from various sources, with effectiveness of implementation being estimated using pooled, random-effects meta-analysis. Decision uncertainty is illustrated using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and frontier. RESULTS: Decisions about whether to adopt intensified glycemic control and whether to adopt audit and feedback alter for the maximum values that decision makers are willing to pay for health gain. Through simultaneously incorporating uncertain economic evidence on both guidance and implementation strategy, the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier show an increase in decision uncertainty concerning guideline implementation. CONCLUSIONS: The stochastic application in diabetes care demonstrates that the model provides a simple and useful tool for quantifying and exploring the (combined) uncertainty associated with decision making about adopting guidelines and implementation strategies and, therefore, for informing decisions about efficient resource allocation to change clinical practice.",2009-01-05941,19648827,Med Care,Group Author,2009,47 / 10,1053-61,No,19648827,"Group Author; Modeling the value for money of changing clinical practice change: a stochastic application in diabetes care, Med Care, 2009-Oct; 47(10):0025-7079; 1053-61",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Intensified glycemic control with conventional therapy (drugs and patient education/advice), in addition to audit and feedback system vs. Standard glycemic control practice",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,Not Stated,25000,Euro,2007,42785.13

METHOD: We used 4-month open label follow-up data from routine memory clinic patients. There were 852 patients with AD and 112 with DLB. We applied three predictive models to estimate clinical and economic outcomes at five years, comparing AD and DLB patients with hypothetical untreated controls. RESULTS: The mean improvement in MMSE in 852 AD patients was 0.57 (SD 3.4) at 4 months, and in the subgroup with baseline MMSE of 10-20 (moderate) was 1.6 (SD 3.7). Overall, the 112 DLB patients improved by 1.4 (SD 3.7). DLB patients with an MMSE 10-20 improved by 3.1 (SD 4.5) points.

6446,An economic evaluation comparing once daily with twice daily mesalazine for maintaining remission based on results from a randomised controlled clinical trial,"Standard practice to maintain remission in ulcerative colitis (UC) consists of daily mesalazine therapy. However, frequent dosing is associated with poor adherence and increased failure rates. The PODIUM (Pentasa? Once Daily In UC Maintenance) randomised control trial showed 2 g once daily (OD) to be superior to twice daily (BD) dosing for maintaining remission. We sought to determine whether this alternative dosing regimen is cost-effective.An economic evaluation was conducted to compare costs and outcomes of OD with twice daily (BD) dosing. The main outcome considered was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on health state utilities derived from the primary outcome measure, remission without relapse at 12 months defined by a UCDAI score =1. The economic evaluation consisted of two health states: (1) remission and (2) active UC.Annual average treatment costs for OD and BD dosing were ?654 (95% CI: ?536-?759) and ?747 (?620-?860), respectively with an average per person savings of ?93 per year. Average annual costs of ancillary care for relapse for OD and BD dosing were ?307 (?241-?383) and ?396 (?320-?483), respectively. Treatment with OD 2 g mesalazine resulted in an incremental QALY improvement of 0.004 units, indicating that it was the dominant treatment option (i.e. improved outcomes and cost-saving). Variations in parameter estimates in the sensitivity analysis indicated that mesalazine had >0.95 probability of being cost-effective compared to BD based on accepted willingness to pay thresholds applied by the UK National Health Service.Once daily 2 g mesalazine for maintaining remission in UC is cost-saving compared with 1 g twice daily.

6447,Five-year Irish trial of CLI patients with TASC II type C/D lesions undergoing subintimal angioplasty or bypass surgery based on plaque echolucency,"To report a 5-year observational parallel group study comparing the effectiveness of subintimal angioplasty (SIA) to bypass grafting (BG) for treatment of TASC II type C/D lesions in the lower limb arteries of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).Of 1076 patients referred with PVD from 2002 to 2007, 206 SIAs in 190 patients (104 women; mean age 73+/-13 years) and 128 bypass grafts in 119 patients (77 men; mean age 70+/-14 years) were enrolled in the study. All patients had Rutherford classification 4-6 ischemia manifested as rest pain and/or tissue loss. Primary endpoints were (1) survival free from amputation and (2) sustained clinical improvement [+2 Rutherford category and/or ABI increase >0.15 without target lesion revascularization (TLR)]. Secondary endpoints were major adverse events (MAE), the binary restenosis rate, freedom from TLR, and a special quality-adjusted life year (QALY) endpoint (Q-TWiST) that incorporated both length and quality of life to evaluate treatments. A cost analysis was also performed.At 5 years, clinical improvement was sustained in 82.8% of the SIA group versus 68.2% of the BG patients (p = 0.106). Five-year all-cause survival was similar for SIA (78.6%) and BG (80.1%; p = 0.734), as was amputation-free survival (SIA 72.9% versus BG 71.2%; p = 0.976). Hyperfibrinogenemia (p = 0.009) and C-reactive protein (p = 0.019) had negative effects on survival without amputation. Five-year freedom from binary restenosis rates were 72.8% for SIA versus 65.3% for BG (p = 0.700). While the 5-year freedom from TLR rates (SIA 85.9% versus BS 72.1%, p = 0.262) were not statistically significant, the risk of MAE (p<0.002) and length of hospital stay (p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in the SIA group. Q-TWiST significantly improved (p<0.001) and cost-per-QALY (SIA euro5663 versus BG euro9172, p<0.002) was reduced with SIA. The 5-year risk of re-intervention (p>0.05) and mean number of procedures (p = 0.078) were similar.Five-year freedom from MAE was enhanced by 20% in the SIA group, with substantial cost reduction and better Q-TWiST.

6448,Cost effectiveness of fondaparinux in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome,"Fondaparinux has been shown to reduce the risk of major bleeding and 30-day mortality compared with enoxaparin, in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS). However, its cost effectiveness is not well known.To evaluate the effectiveness and economic attractiveness of fondaparinux relative to enoxaparin in patients with NSTE-ACS treated with triple antiplatelet therapy and early (non-urgent) invasive strategy.The decision model compares two alternative strategies: subcutaneous (SC) enoxaparin (1 mg/kg 12 hourly) versus SC fondaparinux (2.5 mg/day) in NSTE-ACS patients pre-treated with triple antiplatelet therapy and early revascularization. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed from a healthcare perspective, based on a Markov model with a time horizon of the patient lifespan. Univariate sensitivity analysis and probabilistic (Monte Carlo) microsimulation analysis were performed.In the base-case analysis (65 years, Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [TIMI] score 4), the use of fondaparinux was associated with a significant reduction in major bleeding, a slight reduction in adverse cardiac events, and minor improvements in survival and QALYs, together with a small reduction in costs. The dominance of fondaparinux over enoxaparin remained unchanged in the univariate sensitivity analyses. According to Monte Carlo simulation, fondaparinux was cost saving in 99.9% of cases.Compared with enoxaparin, the use of fondaparinux in patients with NSTE-ACS managed with an early invasive strategy appears to be cost effective, even in patients with a low risk of bleeding.",2009-01-13448,19663529,Pharmacoeconomics,Jaime Latour-Perez,2009,27 / 7,585-95,Yes,19663529,"Jaime Latour-Perez; Eva de-Miguel-Balsa; Cost effectiveness of fondaparinux in non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 27(7):1179-2027; 585-95",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fondaparinux vs. Enoxaparin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-2363.64,Euro,2006,-3812.1

The analysis comprised short-term (1 year after initiation of adjuvant therapy) and long-term (up to 15 years) components. The long-term analysis involved a three-state (disease-free, recurrence and death) Markov model. Estimates for transition probabilities, costs and utilities were derived from the X-ACT trial, a Japanese phase II trial, and other published sources. Cost estimates were considered from the perspective of a healthcare payer. Costs were expressed in Japanese Yen (yen), year 2007 values. A discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and outcomes. Cost effectiveness was expressed as a cost per QALY. The effects of uncertainty were explored through one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.In the 1-year analysis, direct costs were yen440,000 ($US4000) less per patient with capecitabine than with FU/LV. In the long-term analysis, differences between treatments in direct medical costs ranged from yen470,000 ($US4300) to yen580,000 ($US5300) depending on the time horizon used. Capecitabine was also projected to increase the number of QALYs compared with FU/LV. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the model outcome was robust. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimate of capecitabine being the dominant regimen was 96.6% at a zero willingness to pay. Direct costs remained lower with capecitabine if the price of generic LV was >OR=50% of the branded product.This analysis suggests that capecitabine improves health outcomes and lowers direct costs compared with bolus FU/LV (i.e. dominant treatment strategy) when used as adjuvant therapy in patients with stage 3 colon cancer in Japan.",2009-01-13449,19663530,Pharmacoeconomics,Takeru Shiroiwa,2009,27 / 7,597-608,Yes,19663530,"Takeru Shiroiwa; Takashi Fukuda; Kojiro Shimozuma; Yasuo Ohashi; Kiichiro Tsutani; Cost-effectiveness analysis of capecitabine compared with bolus 5-fluorouracil/l-leucovorin for the adjuvant treatment of colon cancer in Japan, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 27(7):1179-2027; 597-608",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral capecitabine vs. Intravenous bolus 5-fluorouracil/l-leucovorin (FU/LV),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,-165.71,Japan,2007,-1.76
6450,Cost utility of adalimumab versus infliximab maintenance therapies in the United States for moderately to severely active Crohn's disease,"To determine and compare the cost utilities of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists adalimumab and infliximab as maintenance therapies for patients in the US with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease.Maintenance regimens of adalimumab (40 mg every other week) and infliximab (5 mg/kg) were compared using primary data from the CHARM and published data from the ACCENT I clinical trials. Differences in study samples were minimized by matching and weighting baseline characteristics (Crohn's Disease Activity Index score, age and sex) between the patient groups using the primary clinical trial data. Utilization data were estimated from trial data. Unit costs of TNF antagonists (year 2007 values), hospitalizations (year 2006 values), and other medical costs (year 2006 values) were derived from a systematic literature search. Standard gamble-calculated primary data were used to derive health-utility estimates. Data were analysed in a cost-utility framework from a private payer perspective over a 56-week time horizon. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty related to the base-case cost-utility analysis. Given the time horizon, costs and effects were not discounted.Adalimumab- and infliximab-treated patients were in remission for 47.2% and 37.1% of the 56-week period, respectively. Hospital admissions were 34-40% lower for adalimumab than for infliximab, based on the model and observed data, respectively. Patients treated with adalimumab accrued greater expected QALYs (0.014; 95% CI 0.000, 0.022) and lower costs (-$US4852; 95% CI -6758, 491) in the first year of therapy than patients treated with infliximab. Compared with infliximab maintenance therapy, adalimumab had lower drug and administration costs, less drug waste, and lower hospitalization rates. Univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses suggested that these results were robust.This analysis suggests that adalimumab maintenance therapy is a dominant strategy versus infliximab maintenance therapy for patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

6451,Cost-effectiveness of quetiapine plus mood stabilizers compared with mood stabilizers alone in the maintenance therapy of bipolar I disorder: results of a Markov model analysis,"The aim of this study was to estimate the following: (1) the number of acute mood events prevented by adjunctive quetiapine therapy, and the potential cost savings; (2) the number of acute mood event-associated hospitalizations avoided by using adjunctive quetiapine therapy, and the potential cost savings of this intervention; and (3) the economic value of adjunctive quetiapine therapy in the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder.A Markov model was developed to simulate the transitions of newly stabilized adult patients with bipolar I disorder across 4 possible health states: euthymia, acute mania, acute depression, and discontinued/ no active therapy. Clinical data were obtained from 2 randomized, double-blind, Phase III trials of up to 2 years' duration (D1447C00126 and D1447C00127) that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of quetiapine (versus placebo) when coadministered with lithium or valproate in increasing the time to recurrence of acute mood events in patients with bipolar I disorder. The model evaluated clinical and economic outcomes in 8 quarterly cycles (24 months). Outcome measures included the number of acute mood events, number of hospitalizations related to acute mood events, and their costs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated as a secondary outcome. The model was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, base year 2007.In the model analysis, adjunctive quetiapine with lithium or valproate was associated with a 54% reduction in the occurrence of acute mood events, a 29% reduction in acute mood event-related hospitalization costs, and a 4% improvement in QALY gains, with 5% lower total direct costs than placebo + lithium/valproate. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (in year-2007 pound) were 506 per additional acute mood event avoided, 4261 per additional acute mood event-related hospitalization prevented, and -7453 per additional QALY gained. The sensitivity analyses indicated that these results were robust.The results of this Markov model with a 2-year time horizon suggest that adjunctive quetiapine and mood-stabilizer therapy with lithium or valproate, compared with mood-stabilizer therapy alone in the maintenance treatment of patients with bipolar I disorder, were associated with fewer acute mood events, fewer acute mood event-related hospitalizations, and lower total costs, thereby improving patient mental health outcomes and minimizing impact on payer budgets, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service.",2009-01-13458,19698903,Clin Ther,Liberty Fajutrao,2009,31 Pt 1 /,1456-68,Yes,19698903,"Liberty Fajutrao; Bj?rn Paulsson; Sherry Liu; Julie Locklear; Cost-effectiveness of quetiapine plus mood stabilizers compared with mood stabilizers alone in the maintenance therapy of bipolar I disorder: results of a Markov model analysis, Clin Ther, ; 31 Pt 1():1879-114X; 1456-68",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quetiapine vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.50,3.50,-7465.4,United Kingdom,2007,-18655.73
6452,Cost-utility of treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension: a Markov state-transition decision analysis model,"Clinicians must choose between an increasing number of medications for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with different routes of administration, adverse effects, costs and efficacies. We constructed a decision analysis to help inform treatment choices in PAH.We created a Markov-type model to evaluate 1-year treatment with bosentan, treprostinil, epoprostenol, inhaled iloprost, sildenafil, sitaxentan and ambrisentan.

6474,Cost effectiveness of rasagiline and pramipexole as treatment strategies in early Parkinson's disease in the UK setting: an economic Markov model evaluation,"Levodopa is the most effective treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, after an initial period of benefit, several limitations become apparent, including motor complications such as dyskinesia. Dyskinesia can severely affect patients' quality of life and increases healthcare resource use. Thus, delaying the need for levodopa, and therefore the onset of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, is important.The aim of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness, from a UK healthcare payer perspective, of two antiparkinsonian treatment strategies in early PD: first-line monotherapy with rasagiline, a novel monoamine oxidase B inhibitor; and the non-ergoline dopamine receptor agonist pramipexole.An economic Markov model was developed as a pragmatic tool to derive comparative information on the effectiveness, utility and costs of these two strategies over a 5-year period. Model input data were obtained from the TEMPO study for rasagiline and from a study by the Parkinson Study Group for pramipexole. Effectiveness outcomes were time to levodopa and time to levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Cost and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) data were derived from published sources.Rasagiline was the dominant strategy. Compared with pramipexole, use of the rasagiline strategy was estimated to reduce costs by 18% per patient over 5 years and was associated with an additional 10% delay in dyskinesia onset (0.41 years; 95% CI 0.27, 0.55). This strategy was also found to prolong the time to levodopa initiation by 25% through a gain of 0.83 levodopa-free years (95% CI 0.56, 1.1). In addition, use of the rasagiline strategy was found to generate a 5% gain in QALYs over 5 years compared with the pramipexole strategy (3.7 +/- 0.02 vs 3.51 +/- 0.03). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that the model was robust.Rasagiline represents a cost-effective alternative to pramipexole in the treatment of early PD in the UK.",2009-01-13466,19728752,Drugs Aging,Alan Haycox,2009,26 / 9,791-801,No,19728752,"Alan Haycox; Christophe Armand; Susana Murteira; John Cochran; Cl?ment Fran?ois; Cost effectiveness of rasagiline and pramipexole as treatment strategies in early Parkinson's disease in the UK setting: an economic Markov model evaluation, Drugs Aging, ; 26(9):1170-229X; 791-801",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,First-line monotherapy with rasagiline vs. First-line monotherapy with pramipexole,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,6.00,1.50,-20689.47,United Kingdom,2006,-48961.37

However, assessment of the cost effectiveness of NZ compared with other disease-modifying drugs in the presence of long-term data has been limited.To assess the lifetime cost effectiveness from the US healthcare and societal perspectives of glatiramer acetate (GA) and NZ (both given with symptom management) relative to symptom management alone in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) using evidence from long-term published studies.A Markov model was developed with patients transitioning through health states based on Kurtzke's expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Patients were >/=18 years of age with RRMS, EDSS <6.0 and receiving treatment. Treatment effects were obtained from clinical trials for years 1 and 2 of therapy and long-term clinical assessments thereafter. Transitions were adjusted for discontinuation and persistent NZ antibodies. Patients incurred drug, other medical and lost worker productivity costs. Patient quality of life was considered in the form of utilities, which were taken from assessments of patients with MS.

However, assessment of the cost effectiveness of NZ compared with other disease-modifying drugs in the presence of long-term data has been limited.To assess the lifetime cost effectiveness from the US healthcare and societal perspectives of glatiramer acetate (GA) and NZ (both given with symptom management) relative to symptom management alone in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) using evidence from long-term published studies.A Markov model was developed with patients transitioning through health states based on Kurtzke's expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Patients were >/=18 years of age with RRMS, EDSS <6.0 and receiving treatment. Treatment effects were obtained from clinical trials for years 1 and 2 of therapy and long-term clinical assessments thereafter. Transitions were adjusted for discontinuation and persistent NZ antibodies. Patients incurred drug, other medical and lost worker productivity costs. Patient quality of life was considered in the form of utilities, which were taken from assessments of patients with MS. Costs were valued in 2007 $US, and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. Various parameters and assumptions were tested in one-way sensitivity analyses, and scenario-based analyses were also performed.Remaining lifetime, direct medical costs for patients receiving GA or NZ versus symptom management were $US408 000, $US422 208 and $US341 436, respectively. Patients receiving GA or NZ benefited from increased years in EDSS 0.0-5.5 (1.18 and 1.09, respectively), years relapse-free (1.30 and 1.18) and QALYs (0.1341 and 0.1332). The incremental cost per QALY for GA or NZ compared with symptom management was $US496 222 and $US606 228, respectively, excluding lost worker productivity costs. GA was associated with a cost saving compared with NZ. The incremental cost per QALY results were sensitive to changes in time horizon, disease progression and drug costs. Improved QALYs for NZ were sensitive to changes in the clinical effect of NZ on disease progression and discontinuation over time.GA or NZ in RRMS patients is associated with increased benefits compared with symptom management, albeit at higher costs. Although year 1 and 2 disease progression and relapse rates were better for NZ than GA, long-term evidence may show GA to have similar, if not improved, clinical benefit.",2009-01-13468,19731967,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Stephanie R Earnshaw,2009,7 / 2,91-108,Yes,19731967,"Stephanie R Earnshaw; Jonathan Graham; Merrikay Oleen-Burkey; Jane Castelli-Haley; Kenneth Johnson; Cost effectiveness of glatiramer acetate and natalizumab in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 7(2):1179-1896; 91-108",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with natalizumab (NZ) alongside symptom management vs. Symptom management alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-239473.69,United States,2007,-298918.81
6479,Cost-utility of celecoxib use in different treatment strategies for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis from the Quebec healthcare system perspective,"To assess the cost-utility of celecoxib in three treatment strategies for arthritis in Quebec, considering both upper gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) events.A Markov analytic framework was used to model patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis at low/average and high risk of GI and CV toxicity over 5 years with monthly cycles. Treatment strategies were modelled in line with Canadian clinical practice. In first-line treatment, patients started on celecoxib; second-line, patients started on a non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and switched to celecoxib after a first GI event; third-line, patients started on a non-selective NSAID, added a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after a first GI event, and switched to celecoxib after a second GI event (while maintaining the PPI). Model inputs were determined through comprehensive literature searches (MEDLINE and EMBASE) from 1995 to 2006. Included studies evaluated GI (dyspepsia, uncomplicated and complicated ulcers, death) and CV (myocardial infarction, stroke, death) events. Drug and procedure costs were derived from Canadian published sources (Can$2005).Total costs per patient for celecoxib first-, second-, and third-line treatment were Can$4,790, $3,390, and $3,466, and total quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were 3.251, 3.231, and 3.230, respectively. In all risk categories, celecoxib second-line was less costly and as effective as celecoxib third-line, producing savings to the healthcare system. Although celecoxib first-line generated incremental expenditures versus celecoxib second-line, it was also more effective. The resulting cost-utility ratio for the high-risk population was Can$54,696/QALY. Based on this analytical approach, a treatment strategy where celecoxib is used before the combination of a non-selective NSAID plus a PPI possesses cost advantages for the Quebec provincial drug programme. One-way sensitivity analysis (varying GI and CV event rates, utilities, and cost) generally showed second-line treatment with celecoxib as the dominant strategy compared with third-line treatment with celecoxib.Although effectiveness of second- and third-line celecoxib use is similar, total cost is lower for second-line. These results suggest that the use of celecoxib before the combination of a non-selective NSAID plus a PPI is relatively cost-effective in the treatment of arthritis pain and support the full benefit listing of celecoxib in Quebec's drug programme.",2009-01-13470,19743942,J Med Econ,Louis Bessette,2009,12 / 3,246-58,Yes,19743942,"Louis Bessette; Nancy Risebrough; Nicole Mittmann; Jean-Pascal Roussy; Joanne Ho; Gergana Zlateva; Cost-utility of celecoxib use in different treatment strategies for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis from the Quebec healthcare system perspective, J Med Econ, ; 12(3):1369-6998; 246-58",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,First line therapy with celecoxib vs. Second line therapy with celecoxib,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,67882,Canada,2005,74300.21

The extent to which increased expenditures for an intervention can be offset by reductions in subsequent service costs can be directly related to the choice of cost definitions.To demonstrate how different cost definitions for direct medical costs can impact results and interpretations of a cost-effectiveness analysis.The IMS-CORE Diabetes Model was used to project the lifetime (35-year) cost effectiveness in the US of one pharmacological intervention 'medication A' compared with a second 'medication B' (both unspecified) for type 2 diabetes mellitus. The complications modelled included cardiovascular disease, renal disease, eye disease and neuropathy. The model had a Markov structure with Monte Carlo simulations. Utility values were derived from the published literature. Complication costs were obtained from a retrospective database study that extracted anonymous patient-level data from (primarily private payer) adjudicated medical and pharmaceutical claims. Costs for pharmacy services, outpatient services and inpatient hospitalizations were included. Cost definitions for complications included charged, allowed and paid amounts, and for medications included both wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) and average wholesale price (AWP). Costs were reported in year 2007 values.The cost-effectiveness results differed according to the particular combination of cost definitions employed. The use of charges greatly increased costs for complications. When the analysis incorporated WAC medication prices with charged amounts for complication costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for medication A versus medication B was $US6337 per QALY. When AWP prices were used with charged amounts, medication A became a dominant treatment strategy, i.e. lower costs with greater effectiveness than medication B. For both allowed and paid scenarios, there was a difference in the ICER of over $US10,300 per QALY when medication prices were defined by WAC versus AWP. Ratios of medication costs to cardiovascular complication costs ranged from under 0.45 to over 1.7, depending upon the combination of costing definitions.Explicitly addressing the cost-definition issue can help provide meaningful cost-effectiveness data to payers for policy development and management of healthcare expenditures.
