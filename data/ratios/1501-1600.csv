1501,Cost effectiveness of nasal calcitonin in postmenopausal women: use of Cochrane Collaboration methods for meta-analysis within economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of nasal calcitonin (Miacalcin) compared with no therapy, alendronate or etidronate in the treatment of postmenopausal women with previous osteoporotic fracture. DESIGN AND SETTING: Meta-analysis followed by economic analysis. PERSPECTIVE: A Canadian provincial Ministry of Health. METHODS: The meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials was based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. Economic analysis was conducted within a Markov model using probabilities and costs derived from Canadian sources. RESULTS: The meta-analysis found evidence of the positive effect of both nasal calcitonin and alendronate in reducing the risks of hip, wrist and vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. However, there was a lack of evidence of the effect of etidronate on hip and wrist fractures. For a 65-year-old woman, with 5 years' therapy, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for nasal calcitonin was 46,500 Canadian dollars ($Can) compared with no therapy and $Can32,600 compared with etidronate (1998 values). Comparison with alendronate was highly sensitive to the inclusion of one specific trial. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of the analysis, based on current evidence, nasal calcitonin can be considered at the margins of being cost effective when compared with no therapy. Compared with active therapy, nasal calcitonin can be considered more cost effective than etidronate, but its cost effectiveness versus alendronate is inconclusive.",2001-01-02217,11465301,Pharmacoeconomics,D Coyle,2001,19 / 5 Pt 2,565-75,Yes,11465301,"D Coyle; A Cranney; K M Lee; V Welch; P Tugwell; Cost effectiveness of nasal calcitonin in postmenopausal women: use of Cochrane Collaboration methods for meta-analysis within economic evaluation, Pharmacoeconomics, 2001; 19(5 Pt 2):1179-2027; 565-75",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,10 years of therapy with nasal calcitonin 200IU vs. 10 years of therapy with cyclical etidronate,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,30100,Canada,1998,32249.53
1502,Cost-effectiveness analysis of inhaled zanamivir in the treatment of influenza A and B in high-risk patients,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of zanamivir 10 mg twice daily for 5 days in the treatment of influenza in high-risk patients. DESIGN: Bootstrap cost-effectiveness analysis incorporating within-trial analysis of pooled patient-level cost and effect data. SETTING: UK unit costs and utilities applied to high-risk patients drawn from 6 multinational clinical trials. PATIENTS: A total of 154 zanamivir and 167 placebo high-risk patients were included in the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per day of normal activities; cost per symptom-free day; cost per complication averted; cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: The mean benefit was estimated to be 2.5 days [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68 to 4.27] of normal activities gained; 2.0 (95% CI: 0.56 to 3.51) symptom-free days; and a 9% reduction in complications (95% CI: 0 to 18%). Excluding the effect of rare hospitalisation costs, the cost (1999 values) of gaining a day of normal activities was 9.50 Pounds (95% CI: 5 Pounds to 39 Pounds); cost per symptom-free day was 11.56 Pounds (95% CI: 6 Pounds to 43 Pounds); cost per complication averted was 262 Pounds (95% CI: 90 Pounds to 1574 Pounds). Influenza was estimated to reduce utility by 0.883 per day, demonstrating the debilitating effect of the disease. Extrapolating a day of normal activities to a standard utility measure resulted in a cost per QALY of 3900 Pounds excluding inpatient costs (7490 Pounds including inpatient costs). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves demonstrated 90% certainty that zanamivir would be cost effective at 8000 Pounds per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Significant health benefits can be obtained with zanamivir treatment in high-risk patients.

1503,Cost-effectiveness analysis of dopamine agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine or pergolide are often used in Japan to treat Parkinson's disease. Dopamine agonists are relatively expensive drugs; economic evaluations are required. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in Japan. DESIGN AND SETTING: We used a Markov model to simulate the course of Parkinson's disease and to compare the cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists added to levodopa with that of levodopa alone in Japan. The model assumed that 60-year-old men with Parkinson's disease in Hoehn-Yahr (HY) stages 2 to 5 using levodopa were administered dopamine agonists or continued on levodopa alone. The incremental cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists used for 10 years was then estimated. STUDY PERSPECTIVE: Societal. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: In the patients in HY stage 2, the incremental cost effectiveness of dopamine agonists was 18,610,000 to 19,320,000 yen per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) [$US 172,300 to $US 178,900/QALY; 1998 values] . In patients in HY stage 3 or higher, the use of dopamine agonists was dominant over levodopa alone mainly due to reduced cost for care. In sensitivity analyses, costs and effectiveness of dopamine agonists significantly influenced the results. The use of a generic formulation of bromocriptine was dominant over levodopa alone even in the patients with HY stage 2 disease.

1507,Cost-Utility analysis of tissue plasminogen activator therapy for acute ischaemic stroke: a Canadian healthcare perspective,"BACKGROUND: There are over 40000 ischaemic strokes annually in Canada, which result in significant morbidity, mortality and burden to the healthcare system. A recent, large clinical trial has evaluated tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) intravenously for the treatment of acute ischaemic stroke with promising outcomes but with an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage. OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and economic outcomes of intravenous t-PA therapy (0.9 mg/kg, to a maximum of 90 mg, initiated within 3 hours of stroke onset) versus no t-PA for acute ischaemic stroke based on the outcomes achieved in the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) trial. DESIGN: A Markov model depicting the natural lifetime course after an initial acute ischaemic stroke. On the basis of this model, a simulated trial compared no t-PA with t-PA. PATIENTS: A hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients with acute ischaemic stroke. STUDY PERSPECTIVE: Canadian healthcare system. OUTCOME MEASURES: Total acute stroke and post-stroke treatment costs and cumulative quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: For a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients, the estimated lifetime stroke costs were 103100000 Canadian dollars (SCan) [1999 values) in the t-PA arm ($Can103100 per patient) compared with SCan106900000 in the no t-PA arm ($Can106900 per patient), yielding a lifetime cost difference of $Can3800000 in favour of t-PA versus no t-PA (SCan3800 per patient). In the hypothetical cohort, t-PA treatment resulted in 13 130 QALYs versus 9670 QALYs with no t-PA treatment. This translated into a net benefit of 3460 additional QALYs per 1000 patients (3.46 QALYs per patient). No treatment, outcome or economic variables influenced the model outcome. CONCLUSION: From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, treatment of acute ischaemic stroke with intravenous t-PA is an economically attractive strategy.",2001-01-02220,11700779,Pharmacoeconomics,S E Sinclair,2001,19 / 9,927-36,Yes,11700779,"S E Sinclair; L Frighetto; P S Loewen; R Sunderji; P Teal; S C Fagan; C A Marra; Cost-Utility analysis of tissue plasminogen activator therapy for acute ischaemic stroke: a Canadian healthcare perspective, Pharmacoeconomics, 2001; 19(9):1179-2027; 927-36",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) strategy vs. No tissue plasminogen activator,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,5.00,3.00,-1098.27,Canada,1999,-1148.51
1508,Cost effectiveness of treatment options in advanced breast cancer in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and economic study data for docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine in the treatment of anthracycline-resistant advanced breast cancer. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov decision-analysis model to simulate the clinical course of a 'typical' patient with advanced breast cancer during salvage chemotherapy was updated with response rates and adverse effect rates from phase III clinical trial data for docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine. Costs were taken from UK national databases and hospitals. Utilities were estimated from 30 oncology nurses in the UK using the standard gamble method. PERSPECTIVE: National Health Service. RESULTS: When compared with other chemotherapeutic agents, docetaxel has been shown to increase response rate, time to progression and survival in patients with advanced breast cancer. In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-utility ratio for docetaxel versus paclitaxel was pound1995 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (1998 values). The incremental cost-utility ratio for docetaxel versus vinorelbine was pound14 055 per QALY gained. In the comparison with vinorelbine, docetaxel provided the equivalent of an additional 92 days of perfect health. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model and the validity of the base-case analysis results.

1510,Methylphenidate in children with hyperactivity: review and cost-utility analysis,OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of methylphenidate in the treatment of children with hyperkinetic disorder as defined using ICD-10 criteria. DESIGN: Comprehensive literature review and cost utility analysis comparing methylphenidate treatment with placebo. Costs and effects were estimated from a NHS perspective according to the methodology developed by the previous South and West Development and Evaluation Committee. The number of Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained was estimated by using the Index of Health Related Quality of Life to model treatment effects. RESULTS: Evidence from good and medium quality randomized controlled trials shows benefits of methylphenidate over weeks and months respectively. Evidence beyond 6 months is poorer and it is uncertain whether effects of methylphenidate persist into adolescence and adulthood. Methylphenidate is of reasonable cost-effectiveness when considering short- and medium- term benefits with an estimated cost per QALY of 7 pounds 400 to 9 pounds 200 at 1997 prices.

1511,The cost-effectiveness of intensive national school-based anti-tobacco education: results from the tobacco policy model,"OBJECTIVES: School-based anti-tobacco education using the ""social influences"" model is known to reduce smoking among youth by 5-56%. Program effectiveness, however, dissipates in 1-4 years. Consequently, opinion leaders have questioned whether a more intensive national educational effort would be economically efficient. To address this question, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of enhanced nationwide school-based anti-tobacco education relative to the status quo. METHODS: To estimate cost-effectiveness, we created the Tobacco Policy Model, a system dynamics computer simulation model. The model relies on secondary data and is designed to calculate the expected costs and public health gains of any tobacco policy or intervention over any time frame. RESULTS: Over 50 years, cost-effectiveness is estimated to lie between $4,900 and $340,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), depending on the degree and longevity of program effectiveness. Assuming a 30% effectiveness that dissipates in 4 years, cost-effectiveness is $20,000/QALY.

1523,Cost-effectiveness of screening and extended anticoagulation for carriers of both factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A,"Carriers of a double thrombophilic mutation (factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A) are at high risk of a recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and may benefit from a longer course of secondary prophylaxis. We examined the costs and health benefits of screening for both the mutations, provided that double heterozygotes undergo 2 years of anticoagulation as compared to the standard 6 months. We thus pooled the available evidence and calculated that the OR for recurrence in double heterozygotes was 5.9 (95% CI 2.65-13.20). A Markov model tracked patients' health lifelong, and calculated that prolonged prophylaxis saved 26 quality-adjusted days of life and $410 per double heterozygote treated. Screening all the patients with venous thromboembolism thus provided one additional day of life at the cost of 13624 $/QALY (95% CI 12 965-22 889). Screening was not cost-effective in those cohorts with a low prevalence of the mutations, a high bleeding risk or in those where prophylaxis prevented <65% of recurrences.

1524,Cost effectiveness of an outpatient multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation programme,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary rehabilitation programmes improve the health of patients disabled by lung disease but their cost effectiveness is unproved. We undertook a cost/utility analysis in conjunction with a randomised controlled clinical trial of pulmonary rehabilitation versus standard care. METHODS: Two hundred patients, mainly with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, were randomly assigned to either an 18 visit, 6 week rehabilitation programme or standard medical management. The difference between the mean cost of 12 months of care for patients in the rehabilitation and control groups (incremental cost) and the difference between the two groups in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained (incremental utility) were determined. The ratio between incremental cost and utility (incremental cost/utility ratio) was calculated. RESULTS: Each rehabilitation programme for up to 20 patients cost pound 12,120. The mean incremental cost of adding rehabilitation to standard care was pound -152 (95% CI -881 to 577) per patient, p=NS. The incremental utility of adding rehabilitation was 0.030 (95% CI 0.002 to 0.058) QALYs per patient, p=0.03. The point estimate of the incremental cost/utility ratio was therefore negative. The bootstrapping technique was used to model the distribution of cost/utility estimates possible from the data. A high likelihood of generating QALYs at negative or relatively low cost was indicated. The probability of the cost per QALY generated being below pound 0 was 0.64. CONCLUSIONS: This outpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme produces cost per QALY ratios within bounds considered to be cost effective and is likely to result in financial benefits to the health service.",2001-01-02225,11562517,Thorax,T L Griffiths,2001,56 / 10,779-84,No,11562517,"T L Griffiths; C J Phillips; S Davies; M L Burr; I A Campbell; Cost effectiveness of an outpatient multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation programme, Thorax, 2001-Oct; 56(10):0040-6376; 779-84",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pukmonary Rehabilitation vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-5066.67,United Kingdom,1999,-12728.99
1525,Cost-effectiveness analysis of entacapone in Parkinson's disease: a Markov process analysis,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of a complementary treatment with entacapone versus usual care only in patients with Parkinson's disease. METHODS: The setting for this study was the Netherlands. A Markov process model was constructed to model the average quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the costs of both treatments. The model examined a period of 5 years in order to capture the influence of symptom improvement and disease progression. Data for the construction of the model were derived from published literature, including large, multicenter, randomized clinical trials in patients with end-of-dose motor fluctuations. Costs were obtained from published sources. RESULTS: The results of the baseline analysis showed that the use of entacapone as complementary therapy in Parkinson's disease slightly decreased the total average discounted costs from NLG 111,317 to NLG 110,038, while effectiveness increased from 2.42 to 2.56 QALYs (a 6% increase). In addition, entacapone substantially increased time without severe fluctuations by 0.63 years. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. CONCLUSION: The study shows that entacapone is a cost-effective treatment in patients with Parkinson's disease: entacapone yields higher effectiveness in terms of both effectiveness measures (time without severe fluctuations and QALYs), while costs remain quite similar to those for usual care. The additional drug costs for entacapone are offset by reductions in other costs.",2001-01-02226,11705299,Value Health,M J Nuijten,2001,4 / 4,316-28,Yes,11705299,"M J Nuijten; P van Iperen; C Palmer; B J van Hilten; E Snyder; Cost-effectiveness analysis of entacapone in Parkinson's disease: a Markov process analysis, Value Health, 2001 Jul-Aug; 4(4):1098-3015; 316-28",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Entacapone vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,4.00,4.00,-9135.71,Netherlands,1999,-6866.85
1526,Assessment of clinical guidelines for continuation treatment in major depression,"OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to assess the appropriateness of the existing Dutch clinical guidelines for the treatment of depression from a health-economic perspective. The existing guidelines recommend continuation treatment for a period up to 9 months. METHODS: The assessment was based on a Markov model using decision-analytic techniques. For this analysis we defined six mutually exclusive states defined by the existence of depression and type of treatment. The outcomes for the model were defined as: time without depression (TWD), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), direct medical costs, and cost of lost productivity. The primary perspective of the study was that of the third-party payer, while the secondary perspective was that of the society in 1999. The probabilities of clinical events and therapeutic choices as well as the utilities were based on published literature. The medical resource use related to each state was abstracted from published literature and expert opinion. The associated 1999 unit costs of the used medical resources were derived from official Dutch tariff lists of allowable reimbursements. Indirect costs in this model were based on lost productivity only. RESULTS: The results of the primary analysis showed that the use of the guidelines is not cost-effective. Continuation treatment for a period of 9 months increases the total direct medical costs (NLG 1276 vs. NLG 474), decreases the costs resulting from lost productivity (NLG 304 vs. NLG 909), increases total costs (NLG 1580 vs. NLG 1383) and increases TWD (96.9% vs. 86.4%). However, continuation treatment does not change the utility outcomes (0.60 vs. 0.61 QALYs) for both treatment strategies. Hence continuation treatment is not cost-effective from either a third-party payer perspective or a societal perspective. A scenario analysis showed that an extension of the continuation treatment to maintenance treatment might result in a favorable cost-effectiveness outcome of the treatment guideline. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, based on the assumptions used in the model, the current Dutch treatment guidelines for depression are only appropriate from a health-economic perspective if continuation treatment is extended to maintenance treatment.",2001-01-02227,11705296,Value Health,M J Nuijten,2001,4 / 4,281-94,Yes,11705296,"M J Nuijten; Assessment of clinical guidelines for continuation treatment in major depression, Value Health, 2001 Jul-Aug; 4(4):1098-3015; 281-94",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuation treatment for a period up to 9 months (Dutch guidelines) vs. Prolongation of therapy (no guidelines),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,4.00,4.00,-19700,Netherlands,1999,-14807.48

However, continuation treatment does not change the utility outcomes (0.60 vs. 0.61 QALYs) for both treatment strategies. Hence continuation treatment is not cost-effective from either a third-party payer perspective or a societal perspective. A scenario analysis showed that an extension of the continuation treatment to maintenance treatment might result in a favorable cost-effectiveness outcome of the treatment guideline. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, based on the assumptions used in the model, the current Dutch treatment guidelines for depression are only appropriate from a health-economic perspective if continuation treatment is extended to maintenance treatment.",2001-01-02227,11705296,Value Health,M J Nuijten,2001,4 / 4,281-94,Yes,11705296,"M J Nuijten; Assessment of clinical guidelines for continuation treatment in major depression, Value Health, 2001 Jul-Aug; 4(4):1098-3015; 281-94",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment for a period of 20 months vs. Prolongation of therapy (no guidelines),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,4.00,4.00,Not Stated,Netherlands,1999,Not Stated
1528,Cost effectiveness of human papillomavirus testing to augment cervical cancer screening in women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus,"PURPOSE: To determine the cost effectiveness of incorporating molecular testing for high-risk types of human papillomavirus into a cervical cancer screening program for women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model to simulate the natural history of cervical cancer precursor lesions in HIV-infected women. Probabilities of progression and regression of cervical lesions were conditional on transient or persistent infection with human papillomavirus, as well as stage of HIV and effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. Incorporating data from prospective cohort studies, national databases, and published literature, the model was used to calculate quality-adjusted life expectancy, life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for two main strategies: targeted screening-human papillomavirus testing is added to the initial two cervical cytology smears obtained after an HIV diagnosis and subsequent screening intervals are modified based on the test results; and universal screening-no testing for human papillomavirus is performed, and a single cytology screening interval is applied to all women. RESULTS: In HIV-infected women on anti-retroviral therapy, a targeted screening strategy in which cervical cytology screening was conducted every 6 months for women with detected human papillomavirus DNA, and annually for all others, cost $10,000 to $14,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with no screening. A universal screening strategy consisting of annual cervical cytology for all women was 15% less effective and had a less attractive cost-effectiveness ratio. Targeted screening remained economically attractive in multiple sensitivity analyses, although when the overall incidence of cervical cancer precursor lesions was lowered by 75%, the screening interval for women with detected human papillomavirus DNA could be widened to 1 year.

1534,A pragmatic and cost-effective strategy of a combination therapy of interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND: Combination of interferon (IFN) alpha and ribavirin is considered the standard treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C. While combination therapy is more effective than IFN alone, the optimal management of combination treatment remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess a pragmatic and cost-effective strategy for the therapy of treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis C. DESIGN: Markov model on original data of two randomized trials. METHODS: A validated computer simulation model was applied to non-cirrhotic hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients. Patient characteristics and efficacy of treatment were extracted from two randomized trials reporting on 1,445 non-cirrhotic patients. Different strategies were compared separately for genotype 1 and genotype non-1 (mostly genotype 2/3) infections: (1) no treatment; (2) IFN for 48 weeks (if at 12 weeks HCV RNA undetectable); (3) IFN and ribavirin for 24 weeks; (4) IFN and ribavirin for 48 weeks; (5) IFN and ribavirin for 48 weeks (if at 24 weeks HCV RNA undetectable). All strategies were tested for different combinations of known response factors. RESULTS: In genotype non-1 infection, 24 weeks of combination therapy dominates all other strategies. In genotype 1 infection, 48 weeks of combination therapy for week-24 responders only prolongs life expectancy at a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio (CE) of 7,135 euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).

1542,Living donor liver transplantation for early hepatocellular carcinoma: A life-expectancy and cost-effectiveness perspective,"Cadaveric liver transplantation (CLT) is an excellent treatment for early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Its use, however, is limited by the shortage of grafts, with up to 30% of patients developing contraindications to the procedure while waiting for a donor. Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has emerged as an alternative to overcome this limitation. We compared the consequences of LDLT versus CLT using a Markov model balancing the gains and losses in life expectancy among donors and recipients. For a 60-year-old recipient with a 70% 5-year survival after transplantation, a 4% monthly drop-out rate, and a donor with 1% mortality, LDLT became more effective than CLT after 3.5 months on the waiting list. These results varied with the probability of developing contraindications to transplantation, the survival after transplantation, and the donor's mortality. For a 12-month delay saved on the waiting list, the gain in survival provided by LDLT compared with CLT ranged between 0 and 2.8 life years depending on survival after transplantation, time spent on the waiting list, and drop-out rate. LDLT was cost-effective (less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year saved) in all scenarios of waiting lists exceeding 7 months, and this figure ranged from 2 to 16 months when varying the drop-out rate.

1545,Costs and effectiveness of staging and treatment options in early-stage Hodgkin's disease,"PURPOSE: Using a cost-effectiveness analysis, to weigh the costs and benefits of the different staging and treatment options in early-stage Hodgkin's disease. METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic model for a hypothetical cohort of 25-year-old patients with early-stage Hodgkin's disease. Markov models were used to simulate the lifetime costs and prognosis of each staging and treatment strategy. Baseline probabilities and cost estimates were derived from published studies and bills of relevant patient cohorts. RESULTS: Among the six management strategies considered, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of laparotomy and tailored treatment compared with mantle and para-aortic-splenic radiation therapy in all clinical stage I-II patients was $24,100/quality-adjusted life year, while that of the strategy of combined modality therapy in all clinical stage I-II patients compared with laparotomy was $61,700/quality-adjusted life year. All the remaining strategies were dominated by one of these three strategies. Sensitivity analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness ratios were driven predominantly by the effectiveness rather than the cost of each strategy.

1547,Cost-Effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b added to chemotherapy for high-tumor-burden follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"Recent data from GELF (Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires) have shown that the addition of interferon alfa-2b (IFN) to a doxorubicin-containing regimen (CHVP: cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, teniposide and prednisone) prolongs both progression-free survival and overall survival in high-tumor-burden follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This gain must be weighed against the incremental toxicity and cost of IFN over CHVP alone and the objective here was, to determine the marginal cost-effectiveness of additive IFN in the specific setting of high-tumor-burden follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Meta-analysis of GELF trial results employing a Markov model was used with three health states: No Progression, Progressive Disease, and Death. Treatment response, survival and toxicity data are drawn from the GELF study. The current study is based on the final analysis of 242 patients (J Clin Oncol 1998;16:2332-2338), with a six year median follow-up for overall survival (median overall survival: not reached for CHVP + IFN vs 5.6 years for CHVP Only, p = 0.008). Measurements: Quality of life data (utilities) are taken from studies with similar dosing of IFN, from Q-TwiST (quality adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity) analysis of the GELF data and from a panel of experts gathered to develop treatment models for high-tumor-burden follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Costs and quality-adjusted years of life saved were discounted at 3% per annum. Setting: Costs determined for university medical centers in the United States. Results showed that, at the median cohort age of 52, IFN add 9.9 quality-adjusted months at an added cost of $13,900 (marginal cost-effectiveness of $16,900 per quality-adjusted life year, or QALY). A more complex, two-stage model approximates the actual cohort survival curves much better than a simple, one-stage model, but both models yield essentially the same marginal cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analysis to quality of life on IFN shows marginal cost-effectiveness ranging from $15,200/QALY (no penalty for IFN) to $21,300/QALY (20% quality adjustment, greater than that reported). The model is quite insensitive to the probability of IFN toxicity. The model is moderately sensitive to the efficacy of IFN in delaying progression, particularly in the first 18 months (pProgI), but the marginal cost-effectiveness does not rise to $50,000/QALY until pProgI increases 220% from the baseline. Although the model is moderately sensitive to the cost of IFN (cIFN), marginal cost-effectiveness is below $50,000/QALY for values of cIFN below $2580/month (baseline cIFN = $850/month, corresponding to a marginal cost-effectiveness of $16,900/QALY in the baseline case). If the model is modified to reflect the 14% overall survival advantage at five years found in trials utilizing more intensive initial chemotherapy (including the GELF trial), then the marginal cost-effectiveness drops to $11,900/QALY in the baseline case. In condusion, based on data from the GELF study, low-dose interferon alfa-2b is cost-effective when added to CHVP therapy in the treatment of high-tumor-burden follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The analysis is robust: the model employs very conservative assumptions, and additive IFN remains cost-effective over wide ranges of variables in sensitivity analyses. The marginal cost-effectiveness is best expressed as being in the range of $12,000/QALY to $17,000/QALY in the baseline case.

The French group study design permitted a single crossover to include or discontinue cytarabine or interferon. Endpoints were overall survival, complete hematologic remission (CHR) at six months, and major cytogenetic response at 12 months. We modified a published Markov model that compared IFN-alpha alone to IFN-alpha plus cytarabine and included the possibility of crossover as in the French study. The model permits allogeneic and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT), and follows cytogenetic response and acceleration of CML through death. Treatment response, toxicity, and survival are drawn from the French Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Study Group population of 810 patients on an intention-to-treat model. Survivals are extended to 62 months based on currently available follow-up. Costs from a United States oncology specialty institution, and state utilities from previous research and a quality-adjusted Time Without Symptoms or Toxicity analysis of the subject study were discounted at 3% per annum. At the median cohort age of 50, cytarabine offers 21 months of added median survival to IFN-alpha, which itself is superior to conventional chemotherapy by 21 months.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model and cost-effectiveness analysis was performed incorporating the risk group prior probability, MRI and CT sensitivity and specificity, tumor survival, progression rates, and cost per strategy. Outcomes were based on quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: For low-risk children with chronic nonmigraine headaches of >6 months' duration as the sole symptom (prior probability of brain tumor 0.01%), no neuroimaging with close clinical follow-up was less costly and more effective than the 2 neuroimaging strategies. For the intermediate-risk children with migraine headache and normal neurologic examination (prior probability of brain tumor 0.4%), CT-MRI was the most effective strategy but cost >$1 million per QALY gained compared with no neuroimaging. For high-risk children with headache of <6 months' duration and other clinical predictors of a brain tumor such as an abnormal neurologic examination (prior probability of brain tumor 4%), the most effective strategy was MRI, with cost-effectiveness ratio of $113 800 per QALY gained compared with no imaging. CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that MRI maximizes QALY gained at a reasonable cost-effectiveness ratio in children with headache at high risk of having a brain tumor. Conversely, the strategy of no imaging with close clinical follow-up is cost saving in low-risk children. Although the CT-MRI strategy maximizes QALY gained in the intermediate-risk patients, its additional cost per QALY gained is high.

1562,Cost-Effectiveness of tolterodine for patients with urge incontinence who discontinue initial therapy with oxybutynin: a Canadian perspective,"BACKGROUND: Tolterodine is a novel muscarinic receptor antagonist for the treatment of overactive bladder. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of tolterodine for patients with urge incontinence (UI) who discontinue initial therapy with oxybutynin in a Canadian setting. METHODS: We compared 2 treatment strategies for the management of adult patients with UI: (1) generic oxybutynin with no further treatment for patients who discontinue and (2) generic oxybutynin with switch to tolterodine (2 mg BID) for patients who discontinue. We developed a 1-year Markov model (4-week cycle length) with transitions between disease states of normal, mild, moderate, and severe. Transition probabilities over 12 weeks were obtained from randomized trial data, and drug discontinuation rates were obtained from Quebec prescription claims data. Outcome measures were time in ""normal"" health state and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using EuroQol-5D utility scores from a survey of Swedish patients with overactive bladder. Costs to the health care payer and patient out-of-pocket costs (in Canadian dollars) were included. RESULTS: For patients who discontinue oxybutynin, the use of tolterodine is associated with approximately 6 months per year in a normal health or mild disease state, compared with approximately 3 months for those who do not receive further drug therapy after discontinuation. Tolterodine use resulted in an annual additional cost per patient of Can $163. The incremental cost per QALY was Can $9,982 and appeared to be robust to alternative model parameter assumptions.

RESULTS: Both HRT and raloxifene therapy increase life expectancy and are cost-effective relative to no therapy for 50-year-old postmenopausal women. For women at average breast cancer and coronary heart disease risk, lifetime HRT increases quality-adjusted life expectancy more (1.75 versus 1.32 quality-adjusted life years) and costs less ($3802 versus $12,968) than lifetime raloxifene therapy. However, raloxifene is more cost-effective than HRT for women at average coronary risk who have a lifetime breast cancer risk of 15% or higher or who receive 10 years or less of postmenopausal therapy. Raloxifene is also the more cost-effective alternative if HRT reduces coronary heart disease risk by less than 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming the benefit of HRT in coronary heart disease prevention from observational studies, long-term HRT is the most cost-effective alternative for women at average breast cancer and coronary heart disease risk seeking to extend their quality-adjusted life expectancy after menopause. However, raloxifene is the more cost-effective alternative for women at average coronary risk with one or more major breast cancer risk factors (first-degree relative, prior breast biopsy, atypical hyperplasia or BRCA1/2 mutation).

1573,"Cost effectiveness of screening for hepatitis C virus in asymptomatic, average-risk adults","PURPOSE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of screening for hepatitis C in asymptomatic, average-risk adults. METHODS: We used a Markov decision analysis model to estimate the lifetime cost effectiveness of three screening strategies: (1) initial screening for hepatitis C antibody by third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), followed by confirmatory testing for hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR); (2) initial screening for hepatitis C virus RNA by PCR only; and (3) the current practice of not screening. The patient population comprised a hypothetical cohort of average-risk adults presenting to their regular primary health care provider for routine physical examination. The main outcome measure was cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The no screening strategy was the dominant strategy in the baseline analysis. The model was most sensitive to the reduction in quality of life related to patient awareness of hepatitis C infection. Screening with ELISA and PCR was preferred when this value was <0.01 and was cost effective if more than half of the patients who tested positive for hepatitis C actually initiated treatment, or if the annual rate of progression to cirrhosis was greater than 2.5%. Screening with PCR only was never cost effective.

1574,Cost-effectiveness of coronary stenting in acute myocardial infarction: results from the stent primary angioplasty in myocardial infarction (stent-PAMI) trial,"BACKGROUND: Although several randomized trials have demonstrated that coronary stenting improves angiographic and clinical outcomes for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the cost-effectiveness of this practice is unknown. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the long-term costs and cost-effectiveness (C/E) of coronary stenting compared with primary balloon angioplasty as treatment for AMI. Methods and Results- Between December 1996 and November 1997, 900 patients with AMI were randomized to undergo balloon angioplasty (PTCA, n=448) or coronary stenting (n=452). Detailed resource utilization and cost data were collected for each patient's initial hospitalization and for 1 year after randomization. Compared with conventional PTCA, stenting increased procedural costs by approximately $2000 per patient ($6538+/-1778 versus $4561+/-1598, P<0.001). During the 1-year follow-up period, stenting was associated with significant reductions in the need for repeat revascularization and rehospitalization. Although follow-up costs were significantly lower with stenting ($3613+/-7743 versus $4592+/-8198, P=0.03), overall 1-year costs remained approximately $1000/patient higher with stenting than with PTCA ($20 571+/-10 693 versus 19 595+/-10 990, P=0.02). The C/E ratio for stenting compared with PTCA was $10 550 per repeat revascularization avoided. In analyses that incorporated recent changes in stent technology and pricing, the 1-year cost differential fell to <$350/patient, and the C/E ratio improved to $3753 per repeat revascularization avoided. The cost-utility ratio for primary stenting was <$50 000 per quality-adjusted life year gained only if stenting did not increase 1-year mortality by >0.2% compared with PTCA. CONCLUSIONS: As performed in Stent-PAMI, primary stenting for AMI increased 1-year medical care costs compared with primary PTCA.

1578,The cost-effectiveness of fluorodeoxyglucose 18-F positron emission tomography in the N0 neck,"BACKGROUND: Although surgery and radiation are effective treatments of regional lymphatics for classification N0 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients, both have morbidities that could be avoided in approximately 70% of patients without lymph node disease with better diagnostic information. 18-F fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has shown promise in detecting subclinical lymph node disease, but its cost and availability have limited its use. Here, we sought to determine whether the use of FDG-PET was cost-effective as part of a treatment strategy for classification N0 HNSCC patients. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of proceeding from classification of N0 by computed tomography to a PET scan was estimated using standard methods of economic evaluation. Costs were for a large, Midwestern university medical center. Probabilities were computed from a review of the literature. Utilities were obtained by a time-tradeoff method, and life expectancy was estimated using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Outcomes measures were cost per year of life saved and cost per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: Modified radical neck dissection was associated with the lowest morbidity (utility [u] = 0.93), and radical neck dissection plus radiation was associated with the highest (u = 0.68). Life expectancy was estimated to be 5.9 and 11.5 years for patients with and without lymph node disease, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the PET strategy was $8718 per year of life saved, or $2505 per quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: A diagnostic and treatment strategy that proceeds from classification of N0 to a PET scan is cost-effective.

1579,Newborns with suspected occult spinal dysraphism: a cost-effectiveness analysis of diagnostic strategies,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and economic consequences of different diagnostic strategies in newborns with suspected occult spinal dysraphism. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed to project the cost and health outcomes of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US), plain radiographs, and no imaging in newborns with suspected occult spinal dysraphism. Morbidity and mortality rates of early versus late diagnosis of dysraphism and the sensitivity and specificity of MRI, US, and plain radiographs were obtained from the literature. Cost estimates were obtained from a hospital cost accounting database and from the Medicaid fee schedule. RESULTS: We found that the choice of imaging strategy depends on the underlying risk of occult spinal dysraphism. In low-risk children with intergluteal dimple or newborns of diabetic mothers (pretest probability: 0.3%-0.34%), US was the most effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $55 100 per quality-adjusted life year gained. For children with lumbosacral dimples, who have a higher pretest probability of 3.8%, US was less costly and more effective than the other 3 strategies considered. In intermediate-risk newborns with low anorectal malformation (pretest probability: 27%), US was more effective and less costly than radiographs and no imaging. However, MRI was more effective than US at an incremental cost-effectiveness of $1000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. In the high-risk group that included high anorectal malformation, cloacal malformation, and exstrophy (pretest probability: 44%-46%), MRI was actually cost-saving when compared with the other diagnostic strategies. For the intermediate-risk group, we found our analysis to be sensitive to the costs and diagnostic performances (sensitivity and specificity) of MRI and US. Lower MRI cost or greater MRI diagnostic performance improved the cost-effectiveness of the MRI strategy, whereas lower US cost or greater US diagnostic performance worsened the cost-effectiveness of the MRI strategy. Therefore, individual or institutional expertise with a specific diagnostic modality (MRI versus US) may influence the optimal diagnostic strategy.

1583,Strategies for diagnosing and treating suspected acute bacterial sinusitis: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Symptoms suggestive of acute bacterial sinusitis are common. Available diagnostic and treatment options generate substantial costs with uncertain benefits. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies to identify the optimal approach. DESIGN: For such patients, we created a Markov model to examine four strategies: 1) no antibiotic treatment; 2) empirical antibiotic treatment; 3) clinical criteria-guided treatment; and 4) radiography-guided treatment. The model simulated a 14-day course of illness, included sinusitis prevalence, antibiotic side effects, sinusitis complications, direct and indirect costs, and symptom severity. Strategies costing less than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained were considered ""cost-effective.""

Available diagnostic and treatment options generate substantial costs with uncertain benefits. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alternative management strategies to identify the optimal approach. DESIGN: For such patients, we created a Markov model to examine four strategies: 1) no antibiotic treatment; 2) empirical antibiotic treatment; 3) clinical criteria-guided treatment; and 4) radiography-guided treatment. The model simulated a 14-day course of illness, included sinusitis prevalence, antibiotic side effects, sinusitis complications, direct and indirect costs, and symptom severity. Strategies costing less than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained were considered ""cost-effective."" MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For mild or moderate disease, basing antibiotic treatment on clinical criteria was cost-effective in clinical settings where sinusitis prevalence is within the range of 15% to 93% or 3% to 63%, respectively. For severe disease, or to prevent sinusitis or antibiotic side effect symptoms, use of clinical criteria was cost-effective in settings with lower prevalence (below 51% or 44%, respectively); empirical antibiotics was cost-effective with higher prevalence.

1592,Cost-effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b with and without ribavirin as therapy for chronic hepatitis C in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Recent trials have shown that treatment with a combination of interferon alfa-2b and ribavirin results in sustained loss of detectable hepatitis C-virus (HCV) RNA in a higher proportion of patients than treatment with interferon alone. Combination therapy, however, is two to three times as expensive as monotherapy. METHODS: Based on data from recent randomized clinical trials and a previously published decision model, we developed a Markov model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of initial combination therapy with interferon and ribavirin versus interferon alone for previously untreated patients with chronic HCV infection in Sweden. Clinical praxis and quality adjustments were based on expert estimates and costs were gathered from different health care providers in Sweden. RESULTS: Combination therapy for 24 or 48 weeks, compared to interferon alone, prolonged quality adjusted life expectancy by 0.5 to 1.1 years at marginal cost-effectiveness ratios of US$ 1,400 to US$ 6,000 per DQALY (discounted quality-adjusted life-year) for patients with genotype 1. In genotype 1, 48 weeks compared to 24 weeks of combination therapy prolonged quality adjusted life expectancy by 0.6 years at a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $US 9,800 per DQALY. For patients with genotype non-1, combination therapy for 24 or 48 weeks, compared to interferon alone, prolonged quality adjusted life expectancy by 2.3 years, with combination therapy for 24 weeks being money-saving.

1597,Should programmes for community-level meningococcal vaccination be considered in Australia? An economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Disease due to serogroup C Neisseria meningitidis is life-threatening and potentially preventable by vaccination. In 1999, the UK instigated mass vaccination after a sustained increase in serogroup C meningococcal disease. In the same year, Victoria, Australia experienced a similar change in disease epidemiology. It is timely to undertake an economic evaluation of options for community vaccination in Australia based on local data. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses of three options for use of polysaccharide vaccine were undertaken for a hypothetical population aged 15--19 years. Baseline analyses assumed 5 years' duration of vaccine protection following a single year of programme implementation. Sensitivity analyses of key variables were performed, including vaccine coverage and effectiveness, case fatality rate and the discount rate. Outcomes included the number of people vaccinated, cases averted, life-years saved and disability-adjusted life-years (DALY) averted. Cost-benefit analysis used lost earnings avoided as a measure of vaccination benefit. RESULTS: Vaccination of people aged 15--19 years in a defined population with a high rate of disease was the most cost-effective option. Compared with no vaccination and assuming 5 years' duration of protection and exclusion of direct cost savings, this resulted in a discounted cost per life-year saved of $23,623, a cost per DALY avoided of $21,097 and benefits exceeding costs in discounted terms. The 'break-even' incidence rate for this option with exclusion of direct cost savings was 14.0/100,000.

1599,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of environmental management for malaria control,"Roll back malaria (RBM) aims at halving the current burden of the disease by the year 2010. The focus is on sub-Saharan Africa, and it is proposed to implement efficacious and cost-effective control strategies. But the evidence base of such information is scarce, and a notable missing element is the discussion of the potential of environmental management. We reviewed the literature and identified multiple malaria control programmes that incorporated environmental management as the central feature. Prominent among them are programmes launched in 1929 and implemented for two decades at copper mining communities in Zambia. The full package of control measures consisted of vegetation clearance, modification of river boundaries, draining swamps, oil application to open water bodies and house screening. Part of the population also was given quinine and was sleeping under mosquito nets. Monthly malaria incidence rates and vector densities were used for surveillance and adaptive tuning of the environmental management strategies to achieve a high level of performance. Within 3-5 years, malaria-related mortality, morbidity and incidence rates were reduced by 70-95%. Over the entire 20 years of implementation, the programme had averted an estimated 4173 deaths and 161,205 malaria attacks. The estimated costs per death and malaria attack averted were US$ 858 and US$ 22.20, respectively. Over the initial 3-5 years start-up period, analogous to the short-duration of cost-effectiveness analyses of current studies, we estimated that the costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted were US$ 524-591. However, the strategy has a track record of becoming cost-effective in the longer term, as maintenance costs were much lower: US$ 22-92 per DALY averted. In view of fewer adverse ecological effects, increased sustainability and better uses of local resources and knowledge, environmental management--integrated with pharmacological, insecticidal and bednet interventions--could substantially increase the chances of rolling back malaria.",2001-01-02875,11555434,Trop Med Int Health,J Utzinger,2001,6 / 9,677-87,No,11555434,"J Utzinger; Y Tozan; B H Singer; Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of environmental management for malaria control, Trop Med Int Health, 2001-Sep; 6(9):1360-2276; 677-87",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,The Roll Back Malaria Program,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,3.00,Not Stated,United States,1995,Not Stated
