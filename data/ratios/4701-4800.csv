4701,A cost-utility analysis of once daily solifenacin compared to tolterodine in the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of solifenacin, a new generation antimuscarinic, compared with tolterodine in the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A 1-year Markov model was constructed using data from a 12-week, randomised, double-blind study that compared flexible dosing with solifenacin (5 mg and 10 mg) with tolterodine (IR 2 mg bd/ER 4 mg) in adults with OAB. The model incorporated five discrete health states that were based on disease severity (micturitions/day and incontinence episodes/day). A 'drop out' state was also used in the model to account for patients that discontinued treatment in the first year. UK-specific costs for drug treatment and pad use as well as utilities were assigned to each health state. RESULTS: Solifenacin was a less costly and more effective treatment strategy compared with tolterodine. During the course of 1 year, the estimated cost per patient was pound509 for patients treated with solifenacin and pound526 for those given tolterodine, a cost saving of pound17 per patient. Treatment with solifenacin was also associated with a small incremental gain of 0.004 quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) over tolterodine. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the incremental cost effectiveness of solifenacin relative to tolterodine does not appear to exceed pound30 000/QALY with even large variations in key model parameters. CONCLUSION: Flexible dosing with solifenacin is likely to be cost-effective versus tolterodine in the treatment of OAB. Further studies are needed to confirm these results.",2008-01-03624,18565239,Curr Med Res Opin,Mark Speakman,2008,24 / 8,2173-9,No,18565239,"Mark Speakman; Vik Khullar; Anthony Mundy; Isaac Odeyemi; John Bolodeoku; Vik Khullar; Anthony Mundy; Isaac Odeyemi; John Bolodeoku; A cost-utility analysis of once daily solifenacin compared to tolterodine in the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome, Curr Med Res Opin, 2008-Aug; 24(8):0300-7995; 2173-9",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Solifenacin (5 mg/10 mg tablets), 20% of patients receiving 10 mg tablets vs. Tolterodine (IR 2mg bd/4 mg ER)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-4250,United Kingdom,2005,-10252.5
4702,Cost-effectiveness analyses of natalizumab (Tysabri) compared with other disease-modifying therapies for people with highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the UK,"BACKGROUND: Natalizumab (Tysabri) is a new disease-modifying therapy that has been shown to be clinically effective in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and has been licensed for use in patients with highly active RRMS (HARRMS). These patients are those who experience higher relapse rates and faster disability progression than the general RRMS population. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost effectiveness of natalizumab compared with interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate and best supportive care from various UK cost perspectives. METHODS: A 30-year Markov model was developed, based on previously published models for multiple sclerosis, to estimate transition between disability states and the probability of relapse within disability states. The model was parameterized with data from the UK Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Survey 2005 and data from the AFFIRM study, a 2-year multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of natalizumab in RRMS patients. Additional data were sourced from the literature. A UK societal cost perspective was used in the base case, with additional cost perspectives considered in the sensitivity analysis. The baseline characteristics for the patient group were taken from the patient population in the AFFIRM study (mean age 36 years, mean time since diagnosis 5 years and a mean Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score of 2.5). The model and its parameterization were designed and developed to support a reimbursement application for natalizumab submitted to the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Efficacies for natalizumab and glatiramer acetate were taken from clinical trial data, and for interferon-beta from a meta-analysis of clinical trial data. Disutilities from adverse events for each comparator were also included in the model. Outcomes and costs were discounted at 3.5% per anum.Costs for interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate were based on published prices (year 2006 values) under the UK Risk Sharing Scheme, and for natalizumab the UK NHS list price was used. Diagnostic, administration and adverse event costs were also included. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated for the base case, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the probability of cost effectiveness at different willingness-to-pay thresholds. RESULTS: The ICER for natalizumab compared with interferon-beta was 2300 pound per QALY. Compared with glatiramer acetate, it was 2000 pound per QALY, and compared with best supportive care it was 8200 pound per QALY. From a health and social care cost perspective, the ICERs were 18,700 pound, 20,400 pound and 25,500 per QALY, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 pound per QALY, the probability of natalizumab being cost effective against any comparator from a societal perspective was >89%. CONCLUSION: If UK society is willing to pay more than 8200 pound per QALY, or Health and Social Services are willing to pay more than 26,000 pound per QALY, this analysis suggests that natalizumab is likely to be a cost-effective treatment for all patients with HARRMS.",2008-01-03627,18563952,Pharmacoeconomics,Ray Gani,2008,26 / 7,617-27,Yes,18563952,"Ray Gani; Gavin Giovannoni; David Bates; Belinda Kemball; Steve Hughes; John Kerrigan; Cost-effectiveness analyses of natalizumab (Tysabri) compared with other disease-modifying therapies for people with highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2008; 26(7):1179-2027; 617-27",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Natalizumab therapy (300mg), diesese modifying therapy (DMTs) vs. Interferon-ÃŸ",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.50,3.50,2300,United Kingdom,2006,5442.92

4705,The Stretta procedure versus proton pump inhibitors and laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The Stretta procedure is an endoscopic therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Stretta procedure and that of competing strategies in the long-term management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to estimate costs and health outcomes in Canadian patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease over five years, from a Ministry of Health perspective. Strategies included the use of daily proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) and the Stretta procedure. Probabilities and utilities were derived from the literature. Costs are expressed in 2006 Canadian dollars. Units of effectiveness were symptom-free months (SFMs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), using a five-year time horizon. RESULTS: In the analysis that used SFMs, the strategy using PPIs exhibited the lowest costs ($40 per SFM) and the greatest number of SFMs, thus dominating both the LNF and Stretta systems. But the cost-effectiveness analysis using QALYs as the measure of effectiveness showed that PPIs presented the lowest cost-effectiveness ratio, while both the LNF and Stretta strategies were associated with very high incremental costs (approximately $353,000 and $393,000, respectively) to achieve an additional QALY. However, the PPI strategy did not dominate the two other strategies, which were associated with better effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: If SFMs are used as the measure of effectiveness, PPIs dominate the Stretta and LNF strategies. However, if QALYs are used, the PPIs still present the lowest cost and LNF gives the best effectiveness.

4707,Cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in patients older than 55 years of age,"BACKGROUND: Although HIV infection is more prevalent in people younger than age 45 years, a substantial number of infections occur in older persons. Recent guidelines recommend HIV screening in patients age 13 to 64 years. The cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in patients age 55 to 75 years is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and benefits of HIV screening in patients age 55 to 75 years. DESIGN: Markov model. DATA SOURCES: Derived from the literature. TARGET POPULATION: Patients age 55 to 75 years with unknown HIV status. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: HIV screening program for patients age 55 to 75 years compared with current practice. OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: For a 65-year-old patient, HIV screening using traditional counseling costs $55,440 per QALY compared with current practice when the prevalence of HIV was 0.5% and the patient did not have a sexual partner at risk. In sexually active patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $30,020 per QALY. At a prevalence of 0.1%, HIV screening cost less than $60,000 per QALY for patients younger than age 75 years with a partner at risk if less costly streamlined counseling is used. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness of HIV screening depended on HIV prevalence, age of the patient, counseling costs, and whether the patient was sexually active. Sensitivity analyses with other variables did not change the results substantially. LIMITATIONS: The effects of age on the toxicity and efficacy of highly active antiretroviral therapy and death from AIDS were uncertain. Sensitivity analyses exploring these variables did not qualitatively affect the results.

Recent guidelines recommend HIV screening in patients age 13 to 64 years. The cost-effectiveness of HIV screening in patients age 55 to 75 years is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and benefits of HIV screening in patients age 55 to 75 years. DESIGN: Markov model. DATA SOURCES: Derived from the literature. TARGET POPULATION: Patients age 55 to 75 years with unknown HIV status. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: HIV screening program for patients age 55 to 75 years compared with current practice. OUTCOME MEASURES: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: For a 65-year-old patient, HIV screening using traditional counseling costs $55,440 per QALY compared with current practice when the prevalence of HIV was 0.5% and the patient did not have a sexual partner at risk. In sexually active patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $30,020 per QALY. At a prevalence of 0.1%, HIV screening cost less than $60,000 per QALY for patients younger than age 75 years with a partner at risk if less costly streamlined counseling is used. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness of HIV screening depended on HIV prevalence, age of the patient, counseling costs, and whether the patient was sexually active.

4719,Cost-utility analysis of screening high-risk groups for anal cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Cost-utility analysis of screening for anal cancer in high-risk groups from a UK perspective. METHODS: Criteria for the assessment of screening programmes were combined in a Markov model representing the natural history of anal cancer and HIV infection in the UK population of men who have sex with men (MSM). Alternative screening programmes were overlaid on the natural history model to evaluate their impact. The model was populated using data derived from a systematic review of the literature, and calibrated probabilistically to represent joint uncertainty in the input parameters. RESULTS: Reference case results showed screening is unlikely to be cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses identified two important parameters: regression from low-grade anal intra-epithelial neoplasia (AIN) and utility effects. Increased AIN regression rates resulted in a minimum incremental cost per QALY gained of 39,405 pounds, whereas a best case scenario reduced the ratio to 20,996 pounds. CONCLUSIONS: There are major areas of uncertainty.

4729,The incremental cost effectiveness of in-patient versus out-patient rehabilitation after total hip arthroplasty - results of a pilot investigation,"PURPOSE: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is an established and cost effective procedure in the treatment of severe arthritis of the hip. However, bearing recent demographic changes in mind, the increasing demand for total hip arthroplasty during the next decades catalyzes health economic re-consideration of the overall health care process of initial surgery and subsequent rehabilitation. One point for discussion is due to postoperative rehabilitation, since direct costs of the latter crucially depend on whether in-patient (indoor) or out-patient (outdoor) rehabilitation is recommended. Whereas out-patient rehabilitation is obviously more cost efficient from a health insurer's perspective than its indoor alternative, it is open for discussion, whether the alternatives' clinical benefit profiles from a patient's perspective are of comparable order. Therefore this pilot investigation was implemented to assess the clinical benefit and cost effectiveness of in-patient versus out-patient rehabilitation after THA. METHODS: A total of 28 patients (16 females) were enrolled in this retrospective matched pairs cohort study. All patients underwent THA in 2006 and were then assigned to either in-patient (n = 14) or out-patient (n = 14) postoperative rehabilitation at cooperating departments. The in-patient and out-patient samples were recruited from an epidemiological register trial on THA outcome, and matched 1:1 according to gender, age at surgery, working and family state. Preoperative assessment of (algo-) function as well as clinical outcome six months after surgery were based on the WOMAC questionnaire. Primary clinical endpoint of this investigation was the intraindividual increase in the WOMAC score (%), which was transformed into a utility scale ranging from 0 - 100% (optimum self-rating) and then into the number of gained quality adjusted life years (QALY). Primary economic endpoint were the total direct costs (Euro) for the overall treatment including surgery and rehabilitation from the health care insurer's perspective; costs for surgery and stationary care were calculated by means of German DRG rates, costs for postoperative rehabilitation by means of daily rates for indoor and outdoor care and the individual duration of rehabilitation. Based on these primary endpoints, the marginal cost effectiveness ratio (Euro/QALY) was estimated for the indoor and the outdoor based health care process, respectively. RESULTS: The matched pairs' median age difference was 2 years, their median difference in body mass index 0.8 kg/m superset2. Outdoor patients reported a median WOMAC score of 38% before and 87% after surgery, indoor patients of 41% and 88%. Matched pair evaluation revealed a median difference of 5% (interquartile range -18% - 26%) between the matched pair partners' respective WOMAC increases indicating gradual superiority of in-patient rehabilitation (sign test p = 0.719). This WOMAC difference corresponded to a median clinical benefit difference of 0.77 QALYs (interquartile range -2.13 - 3.18 QALYs) between indoor and outdoor patients. The total direct costs for surgery, postoperative care and rehabilitation were calculated 8706 Euro in median for out-patient and 9126 Euro in median for in-patient rehabilitation, their respective median matched pair difference was 420 Euro (198 - 475 Euro, p = 0.013). In summary, the marginal cost effectiveness ratios showed a matched pair difference of -841 Euro / QALY (sign test p = 0.791). The latter demonstrated - not significantly - smaller marginal costs of indoor rehabilitation. CONCLUSION: In this matched pilot investigation the overall health care process involving in-patient rehabilitation after total hip arthroplasty did not demonstrate a significantly superior cost effectiveness when compared to its out-patient alternative from a health care insurer's perspective. This observation is complemented by a rather small difference in clinical benefit. However, prospective investigations, which should randomize the rehabilitation alternatives onto appropriate patients, are necessary to confirm the above pilot results.",2008-01-03638,18558552,Eur J Med Res,Frank Krummenauer,2008,13 / 6,267-74,No,18558552,"Frank Krummenauer; K-P GÃ¼nther; W-C Witzlebf; K-P GÃ¼nther; W-C Witzlebf; The incremental cost effectiveness of in-patient versus out-patient rehabilitation after total hip arthroplasty - results of a pilot investigation, Eur J Med Res, 2008-Jun-24; 13(6):0949-2321; 267-74",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,In-patient rehabilitation vs. Outpatient rehabilitation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-1092.21,Euro,2006,-1761.52
4730,Cost-utility of a visiting service for older widowed individuals: randomised trial,"BACKGROUND: Despite a growing understanding of the effectiveness of bereavement interventions and the groups that benefit most from them, we know little about the cost-effectiveness of bereavement interventions. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis alongside a randomized clinical trial on a visiting service for older widowed individuals (n=110) versus care as usual (CAU; n=106). The visiting service is a selective bereavement intervention that offers social support to lonely widows and widowers by a trained volunteer. Participants were contacted 6-9 months post-loss. Eleven percent of all contacted persons responded and eight percent participated in the trial. The primary outcome measure was quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained (assessed with the EQ-5D), which is a generic measure of health status. Costs were calculated from a societal perspective excluding costs arising from productivity losses. Using the bootstrap method, we obtained the incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR), projected these on a cost-utility plane and presented as an acceptability curve. RESULTS: Overall, the experimental group demonstrated slightly better results against slightly higher costs. Whether the visiting service is acceptable depends on the willingness to pay: at a willingness to pay equal to zero per QALY gained, the visiting service has a probability of 31% of being acceptable; beyond euro20,000, the visiting service has a probability of 70% of being more acceptable than CAU. CONCLUSION: Selective bereavement interventions like the visiting service will not produce large benefits from the health economic point of view, when targeted towards the entire population of all widowed individuals. We recommend that in depth analyses are conducted to identify who benefits most from this kind of interventions, and in what subgroups the incremental cost-utility is best. In the future bereavement interventions are then best directed to these groups.

This analysis adds to existing knowledge by providing further data on the cost-effectiveness of clopidogrel in PCI across a wide spectrum of patients. METHODS: A combined decision tree and Markov model was created. The relative risks of myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death and of major bleedings with clopidogrel were based on a fixed-effects meta-analysis.

A societal perspective was used in Sweden and a payer perspective in Germany and France. Costs are stated in euro2006 and effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The pooled effects of clopidogrel on the combined endpoint showed a relative risk of 0.711 (p=0.003) at 30 days and 0.745 (p=0.002) at end of follow-up (up to 1 year).

4734,The cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis administered by paramedics,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to estimate the expected health outcomes, costs and cost-effectiveness of changing from current practice, where thrombolytic therapy is given in hospital, to paramedic practice where thrombolytic therapy is administered by appropriately trained paramedics (pre-hospital) for STEMI patients. METHODS: A decision-analysis microsimulation model was constructed with a 30-day component and a long-term health state transition component. A brief review of the literature was undertaken to obtain data on time-to-needle to populate the model. The primary health outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); secondary outcomes included cardiac events, procedures and survival. Costs to the Australian healthcare system for the rest of life were taken as the analytical perspective. RESULTS: On average, STEMI patients gain 0.13 QALYs at an additional life-time cost of $343. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $3428 per life-year gained and $2601 per QALY gained. These estimates were robust to changes in a range of assumptions and parameter values. The most important factor was the time-to-needle - the greater the difference between current practice times and paramedic practice times, the greater the health benefits and lower the cost per QALY (and life-year) gained. A key factor in the model was the substantially lower incidence of heart failure from earlier time-to-needle. Importantly, there was little change in the cost per QALY gained for a wide range of ages; thus, there is no argument to limit thrombolysis by paramedics to above or below an age threshold.

An adult formulation of an acellular pertussis vaccine is licensed and available for use in Germany. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential health benefits, risks, costs and cost-effectiveness of routine pertussis vaccination programs for German adults. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate health states and immunity levels associated with pertussis disease and vaccination. The following strategies were evaluated: (1) no adult pertussis vaccination, (2) one-time adult vaccination at 20-64 years, and (3) adult vaccination with decennial boosters. Our main outcome measures were costs (2006 Euros), cases prevented, incremental cost per case prevented and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. We performed sensitivity analyses for key assumptions in the model including disease incidence, vaccine cost, vaccine efficacy, disease costs and frequency of adverse events. Future costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: At a disease incidence of 165 per 100,000, the one-time adult vaccination strategy would prevent 498,000 cases, and the decennial adult vaccination strategy would prevent 1 million cases. Approximately 31 million adults ( approximately 62% of the cohort) would be vaccinated with a one-time adult vaccination strategy for a total program cost of 366 million Euros, while a decennial vaccination strategy would cost 687 million Euros. The one-time adult vaccination strategy resulted in CE ratios of 5800 Euros per QALY saved, or 160 Euros per pertussis case prevented.

The one-time adult vaccination strategy resulted in CE ratios of 5800 Euros per QALY saved, or 160 Euros per pertussis case prevented. The decennial booster strategy cost 7200 Euros per QALY saved, or 200 Euros per case prevented. The results were most sensitive to assumptions about disease incidence and vaccine cost.

4737,"Cost-effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation program delivery models in patients at varying cardiac risk, reason for referral, and sex","BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relative cost-effectiveness of different secondary prevention cardiac rehabilitation (CR) program designs or how cost-effectiveness is influenced by patient clinical and demographic characteristics. The purpose of the study was (i) to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of a standard 3-month CR program (SCR) versus a program distributed over 12 months (distributed CR, DCR); and (ii) to determine the effect of patient demographic characteristics (cardiac risk, cardiac diagnosis, sex) on incremental cost-effectiveness. METHODS: A two group cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial. Patients with coronary artery disease (mean age=58 years, SD+/-10) were randomized to either SCR (n=196) or DCR (n=196) and followed for 24 months. Program delivery costs, cardiac healthcare use, morbidity, mortality, and quality-adjusted life years were assessed. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated with incremental cost-utility analysis. RESULTS: In the pooled analysis, we found the probability of SCR being more cost-effective than DCR was 63-67%. The subanalysis found SCR to be the more cost-effective intervention for patients at high risk, patients with previous coronary artery bypass graft and for male patients. The DCR program was more cost-effective for patients with lower risk of disease progression and for female patients. CONCLUSION: Differences were noted in the cost-effectiveness of CR models based on cardiac risk level, reason for referral, and demographic characteristics.

4738,Economic evaluation of standing order programs for pneumococcal vaccination of hospitalized elderly patients,"BACKGROUND: Standing order programs (SOPs), which allow for vaccination without an individual physician order, are the most effective mechanism to achieve high vaccination rates. Among the suggested settings for the utilization of SOPs are hospital inpatient units, because they provide care for those most likely to benefit from vaccination. The cost-effectiveness of this approach for elderly hospitalized persons is unknown. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of SOPs for pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) vaccination for patients 65 years of age or older in 2 types of hospital. METHODS: In 2004, a 1,094-bed tertiary care hospital implemented a pharmacy-based SOP for PPV, and a 225-bed community hospital implemented a nursing-based SOP for PPV. Newly admitted patients 65 years of age or older were screened for PPV eligibility and then offered PPV. Vaccination rates before and after initiation of SOPs in the United States, incidence rates of invasive pneumococcal disease in the United States, and US economic data were the bases of the cost-effectiveness analyses. One-way and multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: PPV vaccination rates increased 30.5% in the tertiary care hospital and 15.3% in the community hospital. In the base-case cost-effectiveness analysis, using a societal perspective, we found that both pharmacy-based and nursing-based SOPs cost less than $10,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, with program costs (pharmacy-based SOPs cost $4.16 per patient screened, and nursing-based SOPs cost $4.60 per patient screened) and vaccine costs ($18.33 per dose) partially offset by potential savings from cases of invasive pneumococcal disease avoided ($12,436 per case).

4740,Preventive home visits to older people are cost-effective,"AIMS: There is ongoing debate over the effectiveness of preventive home visits (PHVs) for the elderly. A municipality in the north of Sweden carried out a controlled trial of such visits. Healthy seniors aged 75 years and over received two PHVs per year over 2 years. The aim of this study was to do a cost utility analysis of the intervention. METHODS: The intervention group (n=196) was compared with a control group (n=346), and a cost utility analysis was performed. The analysis was carried out with three different time perspectives. Data were sourced from official documents and medical and social records. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, using a time period of 4 years, the analysis of PHVs to healthy seniors showed net savings. When including estimated future costs for health and elderly care during gained life years, the result changed from a net saving to a cost of Euro 200,000. A lifetime perspective also resulted in net savings if the costs of future health and elderly care were not included in the analysis. In this case, the total costs rose to approximately Euro 900,000. The cost could also be expressed as Euro 14,200 per quality-adjusted life year gained if future costs for elderly care and healthcare were included.

4741,Cost-effectiveness of the oral adsorbent AST-120 versus placebo for chronic kidney disease,"Aim: This study was designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AST-120, an oral adsorbent that attenuates the progression of chronic kidney disease. Methods: We developed a Markov model with six health states, including four levels of serum creatinine, haemodialysis and death, using data from a randomized clinical trial conducted in Japan. Direct costs relevant to chronic kidney disease were calculated from a Japanese reimbursement perspective. Projected quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and costs were compared between the AST-120 and placebo groups. The target population was nondiabetic patients with serum creatinine levels from 5.0 to 8.0 mg/dL (442-707 micromol/L) at baseline. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the stability of the results. Results: At 3 years, mean total costs per patient were estimated at yen6.67 million (US$56 982) in the AST-120 group and yen9.38 million (US$80 196) in the placebo group. Mean total costs were yen2.72 million (US$23 205) lower among patients receiving AST-120. QALY per patient were 0.295 (approximately 3.5 months) greater for patients receiving AST-120 than for those receiving placebo over 3 years. The finding that treatment with AST-120 dominated placebo (i.e. was less costly and resulted in more QALY) was upheld in sensitivity analyses.

AIMS: To assess the societal cost-effectiveness of SFT v. TFP in treating borderline personality disorder. METHOD: Costs were assessed by interview. Health-related quality of life was measured using EQ-5D. Outcomes were costs per recovered patient (recovery assessed with the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index) and costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Mean 4-year bootstrapped costs were euro37 826 for SFT and euro46 795 for TFP (95% uncertainty interval for difference -21 775 to 3546); QALYs were 2.15 for SFT and 2.27 for TFP (95% UI -0.51 to 0.28). The percentages of patients who recovered were 52% and 29% respectively. The SFT intervention was less costly and more effective than TFP (dominant), for recovery; it saved euro90 457 for one QALY loss.

4743,Post-acute care for older people in community hospitals--a cost-effectiveness analysis within a multi-centre randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: to compare the cost effectiveness of post-acute care for older people provided in community hospitals with general hospital care. DESIGN: cost-effectiveness study embedded within a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: seven community hospitals and five general hospitals at five centres in the midlands and north of England. Participants: 490 patients needing rehabilitation following hospital admission with an acute illness. Intervention: multidisciplinary team care for older people in community hospitals. MEASUREMENTS: EuroQol EQ-5D scores transformed into quality-adjusted life years; health and social service costs during the 6-month period following randomisation. RESULTS: there was a non-significant difference between the community hospital and general hospital groups for changes in quality-adjusted life-year values from baseline to 6 months (mean difference 0.048; 95% confidence interval -0.028 to 0.123; P = 0.214). Resource use was similar for both groups. The mean (standard deviation) costs per patient for health and social services resources used were comparable for both groups: community hospital group 8,946 pounds ( 6,514 pounds); general hospital group 8,226 pounds ( 7,453 pounds). These findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimate was 16,324 pounds per quality-adjusted life year. A cost effectiveness acceptability curve suggests that if decision makers' willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year was 10,000 pounds, then community hospital care was effective in 47% of cases, and this increased to only 50% if the threshold willingness to pay was raised to 30,000 pounds.

4744,Non-pharmaceutical prevention of hip fractures - a cost-effectiveness analysis of a community-based elderly safety promotion program in Sweden,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Elderly injuries are a recognized public health concern and are due to two factors; osteoporosis and accidental falls. Several osteoporosis pharmaceuticals are considered cost-effective, but intervention programs aiming at preventing falls should also be subjected to economic evaluations. This study presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of a community-based elderly safety promotion program. METHODS: A five-year elderly safety promotion program combining environmental structural changes with individually based measures was implemented in a community in the metropolitan area of Stockholm, Sweden. The community had around 5,500 inhabitants aged 65+ years and a first hip fracture incidence of 10.7 per 1,000 in pre-intervention years 1990-1995. The intervention outcome was measured as avoided hip fractures, obtained from a register-based quasi-experimental longitudinal analysis with several control areas. The long-term consequences in societal costs and health effects due to the avoided hip fractures, conservatively assumed to be avoided for one year, were estimated with a Markov model based on Swedish data. The analysis holds the societal perspective and conforms to recommendations for pharmaceutical cost-effectiveness analyses. RESULTS: Total societal intervention costs amounted to 6.45 million SEK (in Swedish krona 2004; 1 Euro = 9.13 SEK). The number of avoided hip fractures during the six-year post-intervention period was estimated to 14 (0.44 per 1,000 person-years). The Markov model estimated a difference in societal costs between an individual that experiences a first year hip fracture and an individual that avoids a first year hip fracture ranging from 280,000 to 550,000 SEK, and between 1.1 and 3.2 QALYs (quality-adjusted life-years, discounted 3%), for males and females aged 65-79 years and 80+ years. The cost-effectiveness analysis resulted in zero net costs and a gain of 35 QALYs, and the do-nothing alternative was thus dominated. CONCLUSION: The community-based elderly safety promotion program aiming at preventing accidental falls seems as cost-effective as osteoporosis pharmaceuticals.",2008-01-03680,18513425,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Pia Johansson,2008,6 /,11,Yes,18513425,"Pia Johansson; Siv Sadigh; Per Tillgren; Clas Rehnberg; Non-pharmaceutical prevention of hip fractures - a cost-effectiveness analysis of a community-based elderly safety promotion program in Sweden, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2008; 6():1478-7547; 11",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,A five- year elderly safety promotion program vs. No intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-2018.91,Sweden,2004,-377.08

4749,Manual therapy in addition to physiotherapy does not improve clinical or economic outcomes after ankle fracture,"OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding manual therapy to a physiotherapy programme for ankle fracture. DESIGN: Assessor-blinded randomized controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-four adults were recruited within one week of cast removal for isolated ankle fracture. Inclusion criteria were: they were able to weight-bear as tolerated or partial weight-bear, were referred for physiotherapy, and experienced pain. Ninety-one participants completed the study. METHODS: Participants were randomly allocated to receive manual therapy (anterior-posterior joint mobilization over the talus) plus a standard physiotherapy programme (experimental), or the standard physiotherapy programme only (control). They were assessed by a blinded assessor at baseline, and at 4, 12 and 24 weeks. The main outcomes were activity limitation and quality of life. Information on costs and healthcare utilization was collected every 4 weeks up to 24 weeks. RESULTS: There were no clinically worthwhile differences in activity limitation or quality of life between groups at any time-point. There was also no between-group difference in quality-adjusted life-years, but the experimental group incurred higher out-of-pocket costs (mean between-group difference = AU$200, 95% confidence interval 26-432). CONCLUSION: When provided in addition to a physiotherapy programme, manual therapy did not enhance outcome in adults after ankle fracture.",2008-01-03686,18509557,J Rehabil Med,Chung-Wei Christine Lin,2008,40 / 6,433-9,No,18509557,"Chung-Wei Christine Lin; Anne M Moseley; Marion Haas; Kathryn M Refshauge; Robert D Herbert; Anne M Moseley; Marion Haas; Kathryn M Refshauge; Robert D Herbert; Manual therapy in addition to physiotherapy does not improve clinical or economic outcomes after ankle fracture, J Rehabil Med, 2008-Jun; 40(6):1650-1977; 433-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Manual therapy plus standard physiotherapy program vs. Standard physiotherapy program,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,24 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Australia,2005,Not Stated
4750,"Cost-effectiveness of aspirin treatment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events in subgroups based on age, gender, and varying cardiovascular risk","BACKGROUND: Aspirin is effective for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, but it remains unclear for which subgroups of individuals aspirin is beneficial. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of aspirin separately for men and women of different ages with various levels of cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was developed to predict the number of cardiovascular events prevented, quality-adjusted life-years, and costs over a 10-year period. Event rates were taken from Dutch population data, and the relative effectiveness of aspirin was taken from a gender-specific meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results. In 55-year-old persons, aspirin prevented myocardial infarctions in men (127 events per 100,000 person-years) and ischemic strokes in women (17 events per 100,000 person-years). Aspirin implies a net investment and a quality-adjusted life-year gain in men 55 years of age; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 111,949 euros per quality-adjusted life-year (1 euro=$1.27 as of June 2007). Aspirin was cost-effective for 55- and 65-year-old men with moderate cardiovascular risk and men 75 years of age (10-year cardiovascular disease risk >10%). Conversely, aspirin was beneficial for women 65 years of age with high cardiovascular risk and women 75 years of age with moderate cardiovascular risk (10-year cardiovascular disease risk >15%). Results were sensitive to drug treatment costs, effectiveness of aspirin treatment, and utility of taking aspirin. CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin treatment for primary prevention is cost-effective for men with a 10-year cardiovascular disease risk of >10% and for women with a risk of >15%.

4760,"Cost-effectiveness of aspirin treatment in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease events in subgroups based on age, gender, and varying cardiovascular risk","BACKGROUND: Aspirin is effective for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events, but it remains unclear for which subgroups of individuals aspirin is beneficial. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of aspirin separately for men and women of different ages with various levels of cardiovascular disease risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model was developed to predict the number of cardiovascular events prevented, quality-adjusted life-years, and costs over a 10-year period. Event rates were taken from Dutch population data, and the relative effectiveness of aspirin was taken from a gender-specific meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results. In 55-year-old persons, aspirin prevented myocardial infarctions in men (127 events per 100,000 person-years) and ischemic strokes in women (17 events per 100,000 person-years). Aspirin implies a net investment and a quality-adjusted life-year gain in men 55 years of age; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 111,949 euros per quality-adjusted life-year (1 euro=$1.27 as of June 2007). Aspirin was cost-effective for 55- and 65-year-old men with moderate cardiovascular risk and men 75 years of age (10-year cardiovascular disease risk >10%). Conversely, aspirin was beneficial for women 65 years of age with high cardiovascular risk and women 75 years of age with moderate cardiovascular risk (10-year cardiovascular disease risk >15%). Results were sensitive to drug treatment costs, effectiveness of aspirin treatment, and utility of taking aspirin.

4762,Screening pregnant women for autoimmune thyroid disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Untreated maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy can have adverse consequences on maternal health and child intelligence quotient (IQ). Our objective was to examine the cost-effectiveness of screening pregnant women for autoimmune thyroid disease. DESIGN: We developed a state-transition Markov model and performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of screening pregnant US women, aged 15-45 years, with no known history of thyroid disease, in the first trimester. METHODS: Three strategies were compared: 1) no screening, 2) one-time screening using anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies, and 3) one-time screening using TSH. Screening tests were added to the laboratory tests of the first prenatal visit. Abnormal screening tests were followed by further testing and subsequent thyroxine treatment of hypothyroid women. RESULTS: Screening pregnant women in the first trimester using TSH was cost-saving compared with no screening. Screening using anti-TPO antibodies was cost-effective compared with TSH screening with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $15,182 per quality-adjusted life year. Screening using TSH remained cost-saving across a wide range of ages at screening, costs of treatment, and probabilities of adverse outcomes. The cost-effectiveness of anti-TPO screening compared with TSH screening was mostly influenced by the probability of diagnosing hypothyroidism in unscreened subjects or subjects with a normal screening test. Screening remained highly cost-effective in scenarios where we assumed no improvement of child IQ outcomes by levothyroxine treatment.

4768,Prolonged conservative care versus early surgery in patients with sciatica from lumbar disc herniation: cost utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the faster recovery after early surgery for sciatica compared with prolonged conservative care is attained at reasonable costs. DESIGN: Cost utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Nine Dutch hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 283 patients with sciatica for 6-12 weeks, caused by lumbar disc herniation. INTERVENTIONS: Six months of prolonged conservative care compared with early surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at one year and societal costs, estimated from patient reported utilities (UK and US EuroQol, SF-6D, and visual analogue scale) and diaries on costs (healthcare, patient's costs, and productivity). RESULTS: Compared with prolonged conservative care, early surgery provided faster recovery, with a gain in QALYs according to the UK EuroQol of 0.044 (95% confidence interval 0.005 to 0.083), the US EuroQol of 0.032 (0.005 to 0.059), the SF-6D of 0.024 (0.003 to 0.046), and the visual analogue scale of 0.032 (-0.003 to 0.066). From the healthcare perspective, early surgery resulted in higher costs (difference euro1819 (pound1449; $2832), 95% confidence interval euro842 to euro2790), with a cost utility ratio per QALY of euro41 000 (euro14,000 to euro430 000). From the societal perspective, savings on productivity costs led to a negligible total difference in cost (euro-12, euro-4029 to euro4006). CONCLUSIONS: Faster recovery from sciatica makes early surgery likely to be cost effective compared with prolonged conservative care. The estimated difference in healthcare costs was acceptable and was compensated for by the difference in absenteeism from work. For a willingness to pay of euro40,000 or more per QALY, early surgery need not be withheld for economic reasons.

4769,Enhanced diabetes care to patients of south Asian ethnic origin (the United Kingdom Asian Diabetes Study): a cluster randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Delivery of high-quality, evidence-based health care to deprived sectors of the community is a major goal for society. We investigated the effectiveness of a culturally sensitive, enhanced care package in UK general practices for improvement of cardiovascular risk factors in patients of south Asian origin with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: In this cluster randomised controlled trial, 21 inner-city practices in the UK were assigned by simple randomisation to intervention (enhanced care including additional time with practice nurse and support from a link worker and diabetes-specialist nurse [nine practices; n=868]) or control (standard care [12 practices; n=618]) groups. All adult patients of south Asian origin with type 2 diabetes were eligible. Prescribing algorithms with clearly defined targets were provided for all practices. Primary outcomes were changes in blood pressure, total cholesterol, and glycaemic control (haemoglobin A1c) after 2 years. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN 38297969. FINDINGS: We recorded significant differences between treatment groups in diastolic blood pressure (1.91 [95% CI -2.88 to -0.94] mm Hg, p=0.0001) and mean arterial pressure (1.36 [-2.49 to -0.23] mm Hg, p=0.0180), after adjustment for confounders and clustering. We noted no significant differences between groups for total cholesterol (0.03 [-0.04 to 0.11] mmol/L), systolic blood pressure (-0.33 [-2.41 to 1.75] mm Hg), or HbA1c (-0.15% [-0.33 to 0.03]). Economic analysis suggests that the nurse-led intervention was not cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio pound28 933 per QALY gained). Across the whole study population over the 2 years of the trial, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and cholesterol decreased significantly by 4.9 (95% CI 4.0-5.9) mm Hg, 3.8 (3.2-4.4) mm Hg, and 0.45 (0.40-0.51) mmol/L, respectively, and we recorded a small and non-significant increase for haemoglobin A1c (0.04% [-0.04 to 0.13]), p=0.290). INTERPRETATION: We recorded additional, although small, benefits from our culturally tailored care package that were greater than the secular changes achieved in the UK in recent years. Stricter targets in general practice and further measures to motivate patients are needed to achieve best possible health-care outcomes in south Asian patients with diabetes.",2008-01-03705,18502301,Lancet,S Bellary,2008,371 / 9626,1769-76,No,18502301,"S Bellary; J P O'Hare; N T Raymond; A Gumber; S Mughal; A Szczepura; S Kumar; A H Barnett; Enhanced diabetes care to patients of south Asian ethnic origin (the United Kingdom Asian Diabetes Study): a cluster randomised controlled trial, Lancet, 2008-May-24; 371(9626):0140-6736; 1769-76",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Enhanced care (additional support from nurses) vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,28933,United Kingdom,2006,68469.56
4770,Cost-effectiveness of palivizumab against respiratory syncytial viral infection in high-risk children in Austria,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against severe respiratory syncytial virus infection, in high-risk infants in Austria. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to determine cost-effectiveness in infants born prematurely (<or=35 weeks' gestational age), those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The primary perspective of the analysis was that of the compulsory health insurance fund. The societal perspective was also considered. RESULTS: From the health insurance fund perspective, including the costs associated with asthma, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained) without discounting was estimated to be euro 4484 (2006 euros) in preterm infants, euro 6719 in children with BPD, and euro 2668 in the CHD population. When discounted, these figures increased to euro 14,439, euro 21,672, and euro 9754, respectively. The results from the societal perspective were substantially more cost-effective in all populations. The undiscounted cost per QALY was euro 1435 in preterm infants, euro 4881 in children with BPD, and euro 251 in the CHD group.

4773,Economic Evaluation of Caspofungin versus Liposomal Amphotericin B for Empiric Antifungal Treatment in Patients with Neutropenic Fever in Italy,"Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of caspofungin versus liposomal amphotericin B as empiric antifungal treatment in patients with neutropenic fever in Italy. Methods: The cost-effectiveness of caspofungin versus liposomal amphotericin B was evaluated using a decision-tree model. Patients were stratified by presence or absence of baseline infection. Model outcomes included success in terms of resolution of fever, resolution of baseline infection, absence of breakthrough infection, survival, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved. Discontinuation because of nephrotoxicity or other adverse events were included in the model. Efficacy and safety data were based on a randomized, double-blind, multinational trial of caspofungin compared to liposomal amphotericin B (Walsh 2004). Information on life expectancy, quality of life, medical resource consumption, and costs was obtained from the literature. Results: The caspofungin estimated total treatment cost amounted to euro8351 (95% uncertainty interval euro7801-euro8903), which is euro3470 (euro2575-euro4382) less than with liposomal amphotericin B. Treatment with caspofungin resulted in 0.25 (-0.11; 0.59) QALYs saved in comparison to treatment with liposomal amphotericin B. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated a 93% probability that caspofungin was economically dominant, i.e., cost and QALY saving, and a probability of more than 99% that the costs per QALY saved were below euro20,000, a commonly accepted threshold for cost-effectiveness. Additional analyses with alternative doses of liposomal amphotericin B confirmed these findings.

4774,Cost-Effectiveness of a Low-Calorie Diet and Orlistat for Obese Persons: Modeling Long-Term Health Gains through Prevention of Obesity-Related Chronic Diseases,"Objective: Our study estimated the cost-effectiveness of pharmacologic treatment of obesity in combination with a low-calorie diet in The Netherlands. Methods: Costs and effects of a low-calorie diet-only intervention and of a low-calorie diet in combination with 1 year of orlistat were compared to no treatment. The RIVM Chronic Disease Model was used to project the differences in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and lifetime health-care costs because of the effects of the interventions on body mass index (BMI) status. This was done by linking BMI status to the occurrence of obesity-related diseases and by relating quality of life to disease status. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to study the effect of uncertainty in the model parameters. In univariate sensitivity analysis, we assessed how sensitive the results were to several key assumptions. Results: Incremental costs per QALY gained were euro17,900 for the low-calorie diet-only intervention compared to no intervention and euro58,800 for the low-calorie diet + orlistat compared to the low-calorie diet only. Assuming a direct relation between BMI and quality of life, these ratios decreased to euro6000 per QALY gained and euro24,100 per QALY gained. Costs per QALY gained were also sensitive to assumptions about long-term weight loss maintenance.

4776,Cost-Effectiveness of Early versus Late Cinacalcet Treatment in Addition to Standard Care for Secondary Renal Hyperparathyroidism in the USA,"Objectives: The objective of this research was to estimate lifetime cost-effectiveness of treating patients with cinacalcet early (when parathyroid hormone [PTH] levels are in the range of 300-500 pg/ml) versus delaying treatment with cinacalcet (cinacalcet initiated when PTH levels are >800 pg/ml) in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in the US setting. Methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate the effects of early versus delayed use of cinacalcet (plus standard of care). Four different PTH ranges (</=300 pg/ml; 301-500 pg/ml; 501-800 pg/ml; >800 pg/ml) were used to represent four different health states within the Markov model. Associated with each Markov state (PTH range) were varying risks of major SHPT complications, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), fracture (Fx), and parathyroidectomy (PTx). Baseline cohort characteristics and risks of CVD, Fx, and PTx by PTH category were derived from a large US renal database and published sources. Costs were estimated from the US Renal Data System database and reported in 2006 US Dollars ($). Clinical and economic outcomes were discounted at 3.0% per annum. Results: Early treatment was projected to improve quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.337 years compared to delaying treatment. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $17,275 per QALY gained.

METHODS: A Markov model simulation was carried out in all 237900 Chinese males with age between 35 and 44 from the perspective of the public healthcare provider in Singapore. The main outcome measures were the costs, number of gastric cancer cases prevented, life years saved, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from screening age to death. The uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness ratio was addressed by one-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $16166 per life year saved or $13571 per QALY gained for the serology screening, and $38792 per life year saved and $32525 per QALY gained for the UBT.

4780,Cost effectiveness of recombinant factor VIIa for treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND: Phase I/II placebo-controlled clinical trials of recombinant Factor VIIa (rFVIIa) suggested that administration of rFVIIa within 4 hours after onset of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is safe, limits ICH growth, and improves outcomes. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of rFVIIa for acute ICH treatment, using published Phase II data. We hypothesized that rFVIIa would have a low marginal cost-effectiveness ratio (mCER) given the poor neurologic outcomes after ICH with conventional management. METHODS: We performed an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis from the societal perspective, considering conventional management vs. 80 ug/kg rFVIIa treatment for acute ICH cases meeting Phase II inclusion criteria. The time frame for the analysis was 1. 25 years: data from the Phase II trial was used for 90 day outcomes and rFVIIa complications - arterial thromboembolic events (ATE). We assumed no substantial cost differences in care between the two strategies except: 1) cost of rFVIIa (for an 80 mcg/kg dose in an 80 kg patient, assumed cost of $6,408); 2) cost of ATE side effects from rFVIIa (which also decrease quality of life and increase the chance of death); and 3) differential monetary costs of outcomes and their impact on quality of life, including disposition (home vs. nursing home), and outpatient vs. inpatient rehabilitation. Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore uncertainty in parameter estimates, impact of rFVIIa cost, direct cost of neurologic outcomes, probability of ATE, and outcomes after ATE. RESULTS: In the ""base case"", treating ICH with rFVIIa dominates the usual care strategy by being more effective and less costly. rFVIIa maintained a mCER < $50,000/QALY over a wide range of sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity analyses showed that the cost of rFVIIa must exceed $14,500, or the frequency of ATE exceed 29%, for the mCER to exceed $50,000/QALY. Varying the cost and/or reducing the utility of health states following ATE did not impact results. CONCLUSION: Based on data from preliminary trials, treating selected ICH patients with rFVIIa results in lower cost and improved clinical outcomes.

METHODS: An economic model with Markov processes was developed to estimate the costs and benefits of atomoxetine versus other current ADHD treatment options. The model evaluated atomoxetine in five patient subgroups according to treatment history and the existence of comorbidities precluding stimulant medication. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated for atomoxetine treatment algorithms compared with comparator algorithms. The Markov process incorporated 18 health states, representing a range of outcomes across all treatment options included in the algorithms. Utility values were derived from a survey of 83 parents of children with ADHD. The effectiveness and safety aspects of the treatment options were based on a thorough review of controlled clinical trials and other clinical literature, and validated by international experts. Costs and outcomes were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation over a 1-year duration, with costs estimated from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales. RESULTS: For stimulant-naive patients, the incremental cost per QALY gained for the atomoxetine algorithm compared with immediate-release methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH) was pound 15,224 ( pound 13,241 compared with extended-release MPH). In the stimulant-exposed populations, the incremental cost per QALY for the atomoxetine algorithm was between pound 14,169 and pound 15,878. For patients contraindicated for stimulant therapies, the incremental cost per QALY was pound 11,523 and pound 12,370 for stimulant-naive and stimulant-exposed populations, respectively.

The model evaluated atomoxetine in five patient subgroups according to treatment history and the existence of comorbidities precluding stimulant medication. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was calculated for atomoxetine treatment algorithms compared with comparator algorithms. The Markov process incorporated 18 health states, representing a range of outcomes across all treatment options included in the algorithms. Utility values were derived from a survey of 83 parents of children with ADHD. The effectiveness and safety aspects of the treatment options were based on a thorough review of controlled clinical trials and other clinical literature, and validated by international experts. Costs and outcomes were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation over a 1-year duration, with costs estimated from the perspective of the National Health Service in England and Wales. RESULTS: For stimulant-naive patients, the incremental cost per QALY gained for the atomoxetine algorithm compared with immediate-release methylphenidate hydrochloride (MPH) was pound 15,224 ( pound 13,241 compared with extended-release MPH). In the stimulant-exposed populations, the incremental cost per QALY for the atomoxetine algorithm was between pound 14,169 and pound 15,878. For patients contraindicated for stimulant therapies, the incremental cost per QALY was pound 11,523 and pound 12,370 for stimulant-naive and stimulant-exposed populations, respectively.

Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LTBI therapy, versus none, for different household TB contact profiles. Methods: A 6-year Markov decision analytic model simulating the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), number of active TB cases prevented, and costs for hypothetical cohorts of Canadian household TB contacts defined by TST size and one other attribute relating to demographics, clinical presentation, or medical history.

4796,Cost-Effectiveness of LTBI Treatment for TB Contacts in British Columbia,"Background: Contacts of patients with active TB disease (""TB contacts"") with a tuberculin skin test (TST) size >/=5 mm are currently recommended treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI). Knowing the cost-effectiveness of LTBI therapy for specific TB contact subpopulations may improve the use of limited resources by reducing the treatment of persons at low TB risk. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LTBI therapy, versus none, for different household TB contact profiles. Methods: A 6-year Markov decision analytic model simulating the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), number of active TB cases prevented, and costs for hypothetical cohorts of Canadian household TB contacts defined by TST size and one other attribute relating to demographics, clinical presentation, or medical history. Results: For almost all TST-positive TB contact cohorts evaluated, LTBI treatment was associated with a lower cost and an improvement in health outcomes. For the foreign-born, LTBI treatment cost $65,531 per QALY gained ($3950 per TB case prevented); for the Bacille Calmette-GuÃ©rin (BCG)-vaccinated, $315,452 per QALY gained ($15,349 per TB case prevented). LTBI treatment did not appear cost-effective for any of TB contact groups with a TST size <5 mm. Results were most sensitive to assumptions relating to the protective effect of partial LTBI therapy, compliance to prescribed LTBI treatment, and the calculation of QALY estimates from utility values. Conclusions: Latent TB infection treatment for TB contacts with a TST size >/=5 mm largely appeared cost-effective.

4797,The Cost-Effectiveness of Atypicals in the UK,"Background: In 2002, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), recommended atypical antipsychotics over conventional ones for first-line schizophrenia treatment, based on their lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Objective: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of atypical relative to conventional antipsychotics for the treatment of schizophrenia in the UK. Methods: A discrete event simulation (DES) model was adopted to reflect the treatment of schizophrenia in the UK. The model estimates symptoms (using the Positive and Negative Symptom Score [PANSS]), psychiatrist visits, pharmacological treatment and treatment location, number and duration of psychotic relapses, level of compliance, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and side effects over a 5-year time period. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out. Following NICE's ""atypical"" recommendation, the cost-effectiveness of atypical versus conventional antipsychotics was estimated in a scenario analysis, assuming both groups differ only in side-effect profile. Results: When comparing conventional and atypical antipsychotics, the model predicts that the latter would decrease 5-year costs by pound1633 per patient and result in a QALY gain of 0.101. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests these results are robust. The sensitivity analyses indicate that incremental costs and effects are most sensitive to the differential efficacy of atypicals and conventionals, as measured by PANSS. When it is assumed that the only differences between atypicals and conventionals are found in side-effect profiles, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the atypicals is pound45,000 per QALY gained. Conclusion: According to this DES model for schizophrenia, atypical antipsychotics are cost-effective compared to the conventional antipsychotics. The assumptions used in the model need further validation through large naturalistic based studies with reasonable follow-up to determine the real-life differences between atypicals and conventional antipsychotics.",2008-01-03726,18489517,Value Health,Bart Heeg,2008,/,,Yes,18489517,"Bart Heeg; Erik Buskens; Marc Botteman; Sue Caleo; Mike Ingham; Joep Damen; Frank de Charro; Ben van Hout; The Cost-Effectiveness of Atypicals in the UK, Value Health, 2008-May-15; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Atypical antipsychotics vs. Conventional antipsychotics,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,-16330,United Kingdom,2006,-38644.73
4798,Using Triple Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome Managed Invasively: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Objectives: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) inhibitors in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) pretreated with aspirin and clopidogrel undergoing an early invasive treatment strategy. Methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis were performed from a health-care system perspective, based on a Markov model with a time horizon of the patient life span. The risk of death and ischemic events was assessed using the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) risk score. We compared three strategies: 1) routine upstream use of a GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor to all patients before angiography, 2) deferred selective use of abciximab in the catheterization laboratory just before angioplasty, and 3) double antiplatelet therapy without GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors. Both univariate sensitivity analysis and second-order probabilistic microsimulation were performed. Results: In the base case (65 years old, TIMI score 3), strategy A was the most effective, with an ICER of euro15,150 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Strategy B was dominated by a combination of strategies A and C. The ICER was very sensitive to the age and baseline risk of the patient. According to the widely accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds, strategy A would be cost-effective only in patients with an intermediate to high TIMI score, especially within the younger age groups. The probability that strategy A was cost-effective under the base case was 91.2%. Conclusions: The use of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors upstream in high-risk NSTE-ACS patients (TIMI score >/=3) pretreated with aspirin and clopidogrel is cost-effective, particularly in the younger age groups.",2008-01-03728,18489507,Value Health,Jaime Latour-PÃ©rez,2008,/,,Yes,18489507,"Jaime Latour-PÃ©rez; Eva de Miguel Balsa; Lourdes BetegÃ³n; Xavier Badia; Using Triple Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome Managed Invasively: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Value Health, 2008-May-16; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,upstream use (early administration) of antiplatelet therapy added to aspirin and clopidogrel vs. standard antiplatelet therapy without systematic administration of a GIIb/IIIa inhibitor,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,15150,Euro,2006,24434.06

4800,Cost effectiveness of the German screen-and-treat strategy for postmenopausal osteoporosis,"BACKGROUND: The German osteology umbrella organization, Dachverband Osteologie (DVO), has published a new guideline for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures. According to the guideline, women are screened using dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Those with an absolute 10-year fracture risk > or =30% are treated with bisphosphonates such as alendronate or risedronate for 4 years or with teriparatide for 18 months. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of the screen-and-treat strategy versus no intervention in women of the general population aged 50-90 years in Germany. METHODS: Cost-utility and budget-impact analyses were performed from the perspective of the statutory health insurance (SHI). A Markov model with a 1-year cycle length simulated costs and benefits (QALYs), discounted at 3%, over a lifetime horizon. The number of women correctly diagnosed by pre-tests and DXA as having a 10-year fracture risk of > or =30% was estimated for different age groups (50-60, 60-70, 70-80 and 80-90 years). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated; all costs are presented in euro, year 2006 values. Robustness of the results was tested by a probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Alendronate was the most cost-effective drug in all age groups; the ICERs were euro 3849, euro 16 589, euro 6600 and euro 2337 per QALY for 50-, 60-, 70- and 80-year-old women, respectively, followed by risedronate. Teriparatide was dominated in every age group. Implementing the screen-and-treat strategy would result in annual costs of euro 175 million for alendronate (euro 181 million for risedronate) or 0.14% of the SHI annual budget. Results were robust in the sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: While the screen-and-treat strategy would result in a substantial cost increase for the SHI, the use of alendronate within such a strategy appears cost effective when compared with many generally accepted medical interventions.",2008-01-03730,18489201,Pharmacoeconomics,Dirk Mueller,2008,26 / 6,513-36,Yes,18489201,"Dirk Mueller; Eva Weyler; Afschin Gandjour; Cost effectiveness of the German screen-and-treat strategy for postmenopausal osteoporosis, Pharmacoeconomics, 2008; 26(6):1179-2027; 513-36",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for osteoporosis and treating those with a positive result with alendronate vs. No intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,3849,Euro,2006,6207.7
