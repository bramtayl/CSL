5901,The cost-effectiveness of implementing a new guideline for cardiovascular risk management in primary care in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: A new Dutch guideline for cardiovascular disease management substantially extends the number of individuals for whom treatment with statins and/or antihypertensive agents is recommended. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of implementing the new guideline at the national level. METHODS: First, the number of currently untreated individuals who would become eligible for cholesterol-lowering or antihypertensive treatment under the new guideline was estimated using data from a recent population study. Cost-effectiveness of treating this group of patients was then assessed using a mathematical model. RESULTS: Implementing the guideline in the age category 30-69 years would lead to an additional 465,000 individuals requiring treatment. Over a period of 20 years, the cumulative incidence of acute myocardial infarction in the whole population would drop by 3.0%, that of stroke by 3.9%, and all-cause mortality would drop by 0.9%. The lifetime cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated to be 15,000 Euro per quality-adjusted life year gained. In the age categories 70-79 years and 80 years or above, an additional 600,000 and 450,000 persons, respectively, would need to be treated, resulting in corresponding reductions in cumulative incidences of 14 and 18% (acute myocardial infarction), 17 and 22% (stroke), and 1.2 and 0.6% (all-cause mortality) with cost-effectiveness ratios of 20,800 and 32,300 Euro, respectively, per quality-adjusted life year.

5906,Cost effectiveness analysis of larval therapy for leg ulcers,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of larval therapy compared with hydrogel in the management of leg ulcers. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness and cost utility analyses carried out alongside a pragmatic multicentre, randomised, open trial with equal randomisation. Population Intention to treat population comprising 267 patients with a venous or mixed venous and arterial ulcers with at least 25% coverage of slough or necrotic tissue. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly allocated to debridement with bagged larvae, loose larvae, or hydrogel. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The time horizon was 12 months and costs were estimated from the UK National Health Service perspective. Cost effectiveness outcomes are expressed in terms of incremental costs per ulcer-free day (cost effectiveness analysis) and incremental costs per quality adjusted life years (cost utility analysis). RESULTS: The larvae arms were pooled for the main analysis. Treatment with larval therapy cost, on average, pound96.70 (euro109.61; $140.57) more per participant per year (95% confidence interval - pound491.9 to pound685.8) than treatment with hydrogel. Participants treated with larval therapy healed, on average, 2.42 days before those in the hydrogel arm (95% confidence interval -0.95 to 31.91 days) and had a slightly better health related quality of life, as the annual difference in QALYs was 0.011 (95% confidence interval -0.067 to 0.071). However, none of these differences was statistically significant. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for the base case analysis was estimated at pound8826 per QALY gained and pound40 per ulcer-free day. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the outcome estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Debridement of sloughy or necrotic leg ulcers with larval therapy is likely to produce similar health benefits and have similar costs to treatment with hydrogel.

5907,Antiviral therapy for hepatitis B-related liver cancer prevention is more cost-effective than cancer screening,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: In Australia, Asian-born populations are 6-12 times more likely to develop hepatocellular cancer (HCC) than Australian-born individuals. We therefore, modelled the consequences of different management strategies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Asian-born adults aged > or = 35 years. METHODS: A Markov model compared (1) enhanced surveillance for HCC alone (HCC surveillance), or (2) enhanced HCC surveillance coupled with CHB treatment (HCC prevention) to the current practice, of low CHB treatment uptake. Patients were stratified and managed according to risk categories, based upon hepatitis B virus (HBV) viral load and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. We measured costs, health outcomes [cases of HCC and deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained] and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: HCC surveillance would cost on average AU$8479 per person, compared to AU$2632 with current clinical practice and result in a gain of 0.014 QALYs (AU$401,516/QALY gained). A HCC prevention strategy would cost on average AU$14,600 per person, result in 0.923 QALYs gained (AU$12,956/QALY gained), reduce cases of cirrhosis by 52%, HCC diagnoses by 47% and CHB-related deaths by 56%, compared to current practice.

5910,Cost effectiveness analysis of a hypertension management program in patients with type 2 diabetes,"Hypertension is a costly disease; however, the investment needed for a cost-neutral hypertension management program (HMP) is unknown. A Markov decision analytic model simulated the outcomes of a hypothetical HMP. Patients were between the ages of 25 and 65 years, had existing hypertension, and were newly diagnosed with diabetes. The control group received standard care. The HMP group received standard care and were enrolled in an HMP. Data regarding rates of disease states and costs were gathered from the literature. A third-party payer can invest as much as $159, $109, and $41 per person per month in an HMP for a neutral return on investment in the 5-year, 3-year, and 1-year time horizon, respectively. The HMP group achieved greater gains in quality-adjusted life-years and lower total health-related costs. As the time horizon increases, more money can be invested.

5911,Cost effectiveness of open versus laparoscopic living-donor nephrectomy,"BACKGROUND: Kidney transplantation is an essential part of care for patients with end-stage renal disease. The introduction of laparoscopic living-donor nephrectomy (LLDN) has made live donation more advantageous because of less postoperative pain, earlier return to normal activities, and a consequent potential to increase the pool of kidney donors. However, the cost effectiveness of LLDN remains unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the health and cost consequences of replacing open-donor nephrectomy by LLDN. METHODS: Kidney donors were randomized to laparoscopic (n=63) or open surgery (n=59). We obtained data on operating time, personnel costs, length of stay, cost of analgesic, disposable instruments and complications, and indirect costs. Quality of life was captured before the operation and at 1, 6, and 12 months postdonation by means of short form-36. The scores were translated into utilities by means of Brazier's 6D algorithm. RESULTS: The cost per patient was U.S. $55,292 with laparoscopic and U.S. $29,886 with open surgery. The greatest cost difference was in costs attributed to complications (U.S. $33,162 vs. U.S. $4,573). The 1-year quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 0.780 and 0.765, respectively for laparoscopic and open surgery. This implies a cost of U.S. $1,693,733 per QALY at 12 months follow-up. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the cost of the major complications in the laparoscopic group and magnitude of QALY gain had the greatest impact on cost effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The LLDN is an attractive alternative because it, in general, entails less postoperative pain than open surgery, but it is cost effective only with relatively low rates of complications.",2009-01-05102,19300185,Transplantation,Vida Hamidi,2009,87 / 6,831-8,No,19300185,"Vida Hamidi; Marit Helen Andersen; Ole Oyen; Lars Mathisen; Erik Fosse; Ivar Sønbø Kristiansen; Cost effectiveness of open versus laparoscopic living-donor nephrectomy, Transplantation, 2009-Mar-27; 87(6):0041-1337; 831-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Open surgery vs. Laparoscopic living donor nephrectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,1693733,United States,2007,2114172.39
5912,Costs and cost-effectiveness of four treatment regimens for latent tuberculosis infection,"RATIONALE: Isoniazid given daily for 9 months is the standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), but its effectiveness is limited by poor completion rates. Shorter course regimens and regimens using directly observed therapy result in improved adherence but have higher upfront costs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of regimens for the treatment of LTBI. METHODS: We used a computerized Markov model to estimate total societal costs and benefits associated with four regimens for the treatment of LTBI: self-administered isoniazid daily for 9 months, directly observed isoniazid twice-weekly for 9 months, directly observed isoniazid plus rifapentine once weekly for 3 months, and self-administered rifampin daily for 4 months. In the base-case analysis, subjects were assumed to have newly positive tuberculin skin tests after recent exposure to infectious tuberculosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We determined the costs of treatment, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cases of active tuberculosis prevented. In the base-case analysis, rifampin dominated (less costly with increased benefits) all other regimens except isoniazid plus rifapentine, which was more effective at a cost $48,997 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Isoniazid plus rifapentine dominated all regimens at a relative risk of disease 5.2 times the baseline estimate, or with completion rates less than 34% for isoniazid or 37% for rifampin. Rifampin could be 17% less efficacious than self-administered isoniazid and still be cost-saving compared with this regimen. CONCLUSIONS: In our model, rifampin is cost-saving compared with the standard therapy of self-administered isoniazid.

5916,Cost-effectiveness of botulinum toxin a versus anticholinergic medications for idiopathic urge incontinence,"PURPOSE: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of botulinum toxin A injection compared to anticholinergic medications for the treatment of idiopathic urge incontinence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov decision analysis model was developed to compare the costs in 2008 U. S. dollars and effectiveness in quality adjusted life-years of botulinum toxin A injection and anticholinergic medications. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective with a 2-year time frame using 3-month cycles. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, defined as the difference in cost (botulinum toxin A cost--anticholinergic cost) divided by the difference in effectiveness (botulinum toxin A quality adjusted life-years--anticholinergic quality adjusted life-years). RESULTS: While the botulinum strategy was more expensive ($4,392 vs $2,563) it was also more effective (1.63 vs 1.50 quality adjusted life-years) compared to the anticholinergic regimen. The calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $14,377 per quality adjusted life-year, meaning that botulinum toxin A cost $14,377 per quality adjusted life-year gained. A strategy is often considered cost-effective when the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is less than $50,000 per quality adjusted life-year. Given this definition botulinum toxin A is cost-effective compared to anticholinergics. To determine if there are situations in which anticholinergics would become cost-effective we performed sensitivity analyses. Anticholinergics become cost-effective if compliance exceeds 75% (33% in the base case) and if the botulinum toxin A procedure cost exceeds $3,875 ($1,690 in the base case). For the remainder of the sensitivity analyses botulinum toxin A remained cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Botulinum toxin A injection was cost-effective compared to anticholinergic medications for the treatment of refractory urge incontinence. Anticholinergics become cost-effective if patients are highly compliant with medications or if the botulinum procedure costs increase substantially.",2009-01-05106,19296983,J Urol,Jennifer M Wu,2009,181 / 5,2181-6,No,19296983,"Jennifer M Wu; Nazema Y Siddiqui; Cindy L Amundsen; Evan R Myers; Laura J Havrilesky; Anthony G Visco; Cost-effectiveness of botulinum toxin a versus anticholinergic medications for idiopathic urge incontinence, J Urol, 2009-May; 181(5):0022-5347; 2181-6",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Botulinum toxin therapy vs. Anticholinergic medications,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,14377,United States,2008,17282.28
5917,Cost-effectiveness of patient selection using penumbral-based MRI for intravenous thrombolysis,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Better selection of patients for intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV tPA) treatment may improve clinical outcomes. We examined the cost-effectiveness of adding penumbral-based MRI to usual computed tomography (CT)-based methods to identify patients for IV tPA treatment. METHODS: A decision-analytic model estimated the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with penumbral-based MRI selection in a patient population similar to that enrolled in the IV tPA clinical trials. Inputs were obtained from published literature, clinical trial data, claims databases, and expert opinion. Outcomes included cost per life-year saved and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The addition of penumbral-based MRI selection increased total cost by $103 over the patient's remaining lifetime. Penumbral-based MRI selection resulted in favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale <or=1) more often than CT-based selection (36.66% versus 35.06%) with an incremental cost per life year of $1840 and an incremental cost per QALY of $1004. Multivariate sensitivity analysis predicted cost-effectiveness (<or=$50,000 per QALY) in 99.7% of simulation runs. CONCLUSIONS: Selecting ischemic stroke patients for IV tPA treatment using penumbral-based MRI after routine CT may increase overall acute care costs, but the benefit is large enough to make this highly cost-effective.

5918,The cost-effectiveness of routine office-based identification and subsequent medical treatment of primary open-angle glaucoma in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of routine glaucoma assessment and treatment under current eye care visit and treatment patterns and different levels of treatment effectiveness (from randomized trials). DESIGN: We compared the costs and benefits of routine glaucoma assessment and treatment compared with no treatment using conservative and optimistic assumptions regarding treatment efficacy and including and excluding prediagnostic assessment costs. PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: Computer simulation of 20 million people followed from age 50 years to death or age 100 years. METHODS: With the use of a computer model, we simulated glaucoma incidence, natural progression, diagnosis, and treatment. We defined glaucoma incidence conservatively as a mean deviation of -4 decibels (dB) on visual field testing in either eye for all diagnoses to be both clinically meaningful and unambiguous. We simulated the annual probability of subsequent progression and the quantity of visual field lost when progression occurred. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual field loss, ophthalmologic and nursing home costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost per QALY gained, and cost per year of sight gained. Costs and QALYs were discounted to 2005 values using a 3% rate. RESULTS: Compared with no treatment and when including diagnostic assessment costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness of routine assessment and treatment was $46,000 per QALY gained, assuming conservative treatment efficacy, and $28,000 per QALY gained, assuming optimistic treatment efficacy. Compared with no treatment and when excluding diagnostic assessment costs, the incremental cost-effectiveness of routine assessment and treatment was $20,000 per QALY gained, assuming conservative treatment efficacy, and $11,000 per QALY gained, assuming optimistic treatment efficacy. The cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the treatment costs and the value of QALY losses assigned to visual field losses. CONCLUSIONS: Glaucoma treatment was highly cost-effective when the costs of diagnostic assessments were excluded or when we assumed optimistic treatment efficacy. The cost was reasonable and in line with other health interventions even when diagnostic assessment costs were included and assuming conservative efficacy.

5919,Cost-effectiveness of long-term oxygen therapy for chronic obstructive disease,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of long-term oxygen therapy to facilitate proper resource allocation. STUDY DESIGN: Markov process. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for continuous and nocturnal oxygen therapies. The maximum time horizon was set to 5 years. Efficacy variables were obtained from pertinent clinical studies. Cost variables were based on the current Medicare reimbursement rate and on appropriate sources. Multiple 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to examine the robustness of base-case results. RESULTS: The ICER for continuous oxygen therapy ($16,124 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) was within bounds considered to be cost-effective, while that of nocturnal oxygen therapy was not ($306,356/QALY). The estimated ICER for continuous oxygen therapy was robust (95% confidence interval, $13,153-$24,658/QALY) and was more favorable than the ICERs for commonly used medical and surgical therapies for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The ICER for nocturnal oxygen therapy was sensitive to variation in the mortality rate; it could be as low as $18,267/QALY gained. At the other end, nocturnal oxygen therapy could be less effective than no oxygen therapy, despite additional costs.

5921,Cost effectiveness of antimicrobial catheters in the intensive care unit: addressing uncertainty in the decision,"INTRODUCTION: Some types of antimicrobial-coated central venous catheters (A-CVC) have been shown to be cost effective in preventing catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI). However, not all types have been evaluated, and there are concerns over the quality and usefulness of these earlier studies. There is uncertainty amongst clinicians over which, if any, A-CVCs to use. We re-evaluated the cost effectiveness of all commercially available A-CVCs for prevention of CR-BSI in adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS: We used a Markov decision model to compare the cost effectiveness of A-CVCs relative to uncoated catheters. Four catheter types were evaluated: minocycline and rifampicin (MR)-coated catheters, silver, platinum and carbon (SPC)-impregnated catheters, and two chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine-coated catheters; one coated on the external surface (CH/SSD (ext)) and the other coated on both surfaces (CH/SSD (int/ext)). The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained and the expected net monetary benefits were estimated for each. Uncertainty arising from data estimates, data quality and heterogeneity was explored in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The baseline analysis, with no consideration of uncertainty, indicated all four types of A-CVC were cost-saving relative to uncoated catheters. MR-coated catheters prevented 15 infections per 1,000 catheters and generated the greatest health benefits, 1.6 quality-adjusted life years, and cost savings (AUD $130,289). After considering uncertainty in the current evidence, the MR-coated catheters returned the highest incremental monetary net benefits of AUD $948 per catheter; however there was a 62% probability of error in this conclusion. Although the MR-coated catheters had the highest monetary net benefits across multiple scenarios, the decision was always associated with high uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that the cost effectiveness of using A-CVCs within the ICU is highly uncertain.

Main outcome measures were aggregate costs for regular clinical examination, mammographic screening and further investigations; breast cancer incidence; proportion of cancers detected at ""early"" or ""late"" stage, compared with corresponding data for unscreened women of comparable age; survival in relation to stage at diagnosis; itemised and aggregate costs of management for ""early"" and ""late"" stage breast cancer; hence direct health care costs per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The surveillance programme costs pound1500 (euro1600, US$2100) per woman (over 15 years). Breast cancer incidence is close to 6 per thousand examinations; 75% of tumours are detected through screening and 77% are ""early"" (path stage 1 or 2). Corresponding figures for unscreened women (including relatives of those attending the breast cancer family clinic) indicate that surveillance achieves a beneficial ""stage shift"", with reduction in treatment costs and improvement in survival, in about 22% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: The current clinical service for women at familial risk of breast cancer costs about pound4800 (euro5200, US$6800) per QALY gained. That figure is sensitive to the rate of detection of breast cancer and the degree of beneficial stage shift achieved. Within the realistic range of estimates for these two parameters, the cost per QALY may be as high as pound14,000 (euro15,300, US$20,000) or as low as pound1000 (euro1100, US$1400).",2009-01-05128,19279022,J Med Genet,M M Reis,2009,46 / 5,319-23,No,19279022,"M M Reis; M Tavakoli; J Dewar; D Goudie; A Cook; L McLeish; D Young; J Kenyon; M Steel; Evaluation of a surveillance programme for women with a family history of breast cancer, J Med Genet, 2009-May; 46(5):1468-6244; 319-23",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Annual breast cancer screening comprising mammography and clinical examination vs. No annual screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,15 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,4800,United Kingdom,2007,11995.01
5926,A cost-utility analysis of ablative therapy for Barrett's esophagus,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recommendations for patients with Barrett's esophagus (BE) include endoscopic surveillance with esophagectomy for early-stage cancer, although new technologies to ablate dysplasia and metaplasia are available. This study compares the cost utility of ablation with that of endoscopic surveillance strategies. METHODS: A decision analysis model was created to examine a population of patients with BE (mean age 50), with separate analyses for patients with no dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia (LGD), or high-grade dysplasia (HGD). Strategies compared were no endoscopic surveillance; endoscopic surveillance with ablation for incident dysplasia; immediate ablation followed by endoscopic surveillance in all patients or limited to patients in whom metaplasia persisted; and esophagectomy. Ablation modalities modeled included radiofrequency, argon plasma coagulation, multipolar electrocoagulation, and photodynamic therapy. RESULTS: Endoscopic ablation for patients with HGD could increase life expectancy by 3 quality-adjusted years at an incremental cost of <$6,000 compared with no intervention. Patients with LGD or no dysplasia can also be optimally managed with ablation, but continued surveillance after eradication of metaplasia is expensive. If ablation permanently eradicates >or=28% of LGD or 40% of nondysplastic metaplasia, ablation would be preferred to surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic ablation could be the preferred strategy for managing patients with BE with HGD. Ablation might also be preferred in subjects with LGD or no dysplasia, but the cost effectiveness depends on the long-term effectiveness of ablation and whether surveillance endoscopy can be discontinued after successful ablation.

5929,Outcomes and cost-effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery and whole brain radiotherapy for multiple metastatic brain tumors,"We aimed to analyze the outcomes and cost-effectiveness of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for multiple metastatic brain tumors. Over a period of 5 years, 156 patients with multiple metastatic brain tumors were enrolled and freely assigned by the referring doctors to either gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS, Group A, n=56), or to whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT, Group B, n=100). The follow-up time was set at 1200 days (3.3 years) post-treatment. The number of tumors, patient age, extent of systemic disease and Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score, were recorded and recursive partitioning analysis used. The outcomes analyzed were: mortality, survival time, neurological complications, post-treatment KPS score, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and cost-effectiveness. A paired t-test was used for statistical analysis. Mortality rates for patients receiving GKRS and WBRT were 81.1% and 93.0%, respectively (p=0.05). The mortality rate was lower for GKRS (74.4%) than for WBRT (97.1%) in patients with initial KPS70 (p=0.02). The mortality rate was also significantly lower for GKRS (78.9%) than WBRT (95.5%) in patients with 2-5 tumors (p<0.05). Post-treatment KPS score (mean+/-standard deviation [s.d.] was higher for patients receiving GKRS (73.8+/-13.2) than for those receiving WBRT (45.5+/-26.0), p<0.01. The median survival time for GKRS and WBRT was 9.5 months and 8.3 months, respectively, p=0.72. The mean (+/- s.d.) QALY was 0.76+/-0.23 for GKRS and 0.59+/-0.18 for WBRT, respectively (p<0.05). The cost-effectiveness per unit of QALY was better for the GKRS treatment (US$10,381/QALY) than in the WBRT treatment (US$17,622/QALY), p<0.05. The cost-effectiveness per KPS score was also higher for the GKRS treatment (US$139/KPS score) than for WBRT (US$229/KPS score), p<0.01. Thus, the mortality rate for multiple metastatic brain tumors treated by GKRS is significantly better with a good initial KPS score and when the tumor number is 2-5.

5931,Cost-effectiveness analysis of mammography and clinical breast examination strategies: a comparison with current guidelines,"PURPOSE: Breast cancer screening by mammography and clinical breast exam are commonly used for early tumor detection. Previous cost-effectiveness studies considered mammography alone or did not account for all relevant costs. In this study, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of screening schedules recommended by three major cancer organizations and compared them with alternative strategies. We considered costs of screening examinations, subsequent work-up, biopsy, and treatment interventions after diagnosis. METHODS: We used a microsimulation model to generate women's life histories, and assessed screening and treatment effects on survival. Using statistical models, we accounted for age-specific incidence, preclinical disease duration, and age-specific sensitivity and specificity for each screening modality. The outcomes of interest were quality-adjusted life years (QALY) saved and total costs with a 3% annual discount rate. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used to compare strategies. Sensitivity analyses were done by varying some of the assumptions. RESULTS: Compared with guidelines from the National Cancer Institute and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, alternative strategies were more efficient. Mammography and clinical breast exam in alternating years from ages 40 to 79 years was a cost-effective alternative compared with the guidelines, costing $35,500 per QALY saved compared with no screening. The American Cancer Society guideline was the most effective and the most expensive, costing over $680,000 for an added QALY compared with the above alternative.

5936,Shoulder acute pain in primary health care: is retraining GPs effective? The SAPPHIRE randomized trial: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of providing practical training to general practitioners (GPs) in shoulder problems, and administering a local anaesthetic (lignocaine) vs steroidal (cortisone) injection. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a cluster randomized trial with a factorial design, in general practices across five centres within the UK. A total of 155 participant GPs were randomized to receive training or no training with 200 participants randomized to either lignocaine or cortisone. Health care costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained over 1 year estimated from a health system and a societal perspective were the main outcomes measured. RESULTS: Over 1 year, training GPs costs on average an additional pound sterling 211 (95% credibility interval - pound sterling 237, pound sterling 661) than no training and produces higher mean QALYs (0.075; -0.004, 0.154) per patient, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound sterling 2813 per QALY gained for trained GPs. Over the same period of 1 year, lignocaine costs an average of pound sterling 122 more (- pound sterling 232, pound sterling 476) than cortisone and produces virtually no differential gain in mean QALYs (0.001; -0.068, 0.070), yielding an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound sterling 122,000 for lignocaine compared with cortisone. Across a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds, cortisone is as cost effective to inject as lignocaine. The probability that training is cost effective is above 0.95 at thresholds above pound sterling 20,000. CONCLUSIONS: Providing practical training to GPs about shoulder problems is cost effective and there is little uncertainty regarding this decision.

5937,Shoulder acute pain in primary health care: is retraining GPs effective? The SAPPHIRE randomized trial: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of providing practical training to general practitioners (GPs) in shoulder problems, and administering a local anaesthetic (lignocaine) vs steroidal (cortisone) injection. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a cluster randomized trial with a factorial design, in general practices across five centres within the UK. A total of 155 participant GPs were randomized to receive training or no training with 200 participants randomized to either lignocaine or cortisone. Health care costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained over 1 year estimated from a health system and a societal perspective were the main outcomes measured. RESULTS: Over 1 year, training GPs costs on average an additional pound sterling 211 (95% credibility interval - pound sterling 237, pound sterling 661) than no training and produces higher mean QALYs (0.075; -0.004, 0.154) per patient, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound sterling 2813 per QALY gained for trained GPs. Over the same period of 1 year, lignocaine costs an average of pound sterling 122 more (- pound sterling 232, pound sterling 476) than cortisone and produces virtually no differential gain in mean QALYs (0.001; -0.068, 0.070), yielding an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound sterling 122,000 for lignocaine compared with cortisone. Across a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds, cortisone is as cost effective to inject as lignocaine. The probability that training is cost effective is above 0.95 at thresholds above pound sterling 20,000. CONCLUSIONS: Providing practical training to GPs about shoulder problems is cost effective and there is little uncertainty regarding this decision. The choice between lignocaine and cortisone is more uncertain and it is likely that there is significant value of further research to reduce this uncertainty.

5938,Clinical Benefit and Cost Effectiveness of Total Knee Arthroplasty in the Older Patient,"Purpose: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an effective, but also cost-intensive health care procedure for the elderly. Furthermore, bearing demographic changes in Western Europe in mind, TKA-associated financial investment for health care insurers will increase notably and thereby catalyze discussions on ressource allocation to Orthopedic surgery. To derive a quantitative rationale for such discussions within Western Europe's health care systems, a prospective assessment of both the benefit of TKA from a patient's perspective as well as its cost effectiveness from a health care insurer's perspective was implemented. - Methods: A prospective cost effectiveness trial recruited a total of 65 patients (60% females), who underwent TKA in 2006; median age of patients was 66 years (interquartile range 61 - 74 years). Before and three months after surgery patients were interviewed by means of the EuroQol-5D and the WOMAC questionnaires to assess their individual benefit due to TKA and the subsequent inpatient rehabilitation. Both questionnaires' benefit estimates were transformed into the number of gained quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Total direct cost estimates for the overall care were based on German DRG and rehabilitation cost rates (Euro). The primary clinical endpoint of the investigation was the individual number of QALYs gained by TKA based on the WOMAC interview; the primary health economic endpoint was the marginal cost effectiveness ratio (MCER) relating the costs to the associated gain in quality of life (Euro/QALY). - Results: Total direct costs for the overall procedure were estimed 9549 Euro in median. The WOMAC based interview revealed an overall gain of 4.59 QALYs (interquartile range 2.39 - 6.21 QALYs), resulting in marginal costs of 1795 Euro/QALY (1488 - 3288 Euro/QALY). The corresponding EuroQol based estimates were 2.93 QALYs (1.75 - 5.59 QALYs) and 3063 Euro/QALY (1613 - 5291 Euro/QALY).

5941,Economic evaluation of an integrated diagnostic approach for psychogeriatric patients: results of a randomized controlled trial,"CONTEXT: Because of the increasing number of elderly people with dementia, the costs of dementia and dementia care are expected to grow rapidly in the coming decades. Cost-effectiveness results are relevant for decision making about new strategies in dementia care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an integrated multidisciplinary diagnostic facility for diagnosing dementia in ambulatory psychogeriatric patients. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with an economic evaluation component. SETTING: The Maastricht Evaluation of a Diagnostic Intervention for Cognitively Impaired Elderly, Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, the Netherlands. PATIENTS: A total of 137 patients who received care in the multidisciplinary diagnostic facility and 93 who received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) as the main outcome measure and cognition and behavioral problems as secondary outcome measures. RESULTS: Compared with patients receiving usual care, patients who visited the diagnostic facility gained a mean 0.05 QALY at the extra cost of euro65. The incremental cost per QALY amounted to euro1267. This point estimate lies beneath commonly accepted thresholds and is within an acceptable range of uncertainty. With regard to the secondary analyses, cost-effectiveness results showed a substantial amount of uncertainty and were therefore indecisive. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the main cost-per-QALY analysis, the use of the integrated multidisciplinary diagnostic facility is cost-effective for the diagnosis and management of dementia in ambulatory patients.",2009-01-05159,19255381,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Claire A G Wolfs,2009,66 / 3,313-23,No,19255381,"Claire A G Wolfs; Carmen D Dirksen; Alfons Kessels; Johan L Severens; Frans R J Verhey; Economic evaluation of an integrated diagnostic approach for psychogeriatric patients: results of a randomized controlled trial, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 2009-Mar; 66(3):0003-990X; 313-23",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Integrated diagnostic services for diagnosis of dementia vs. Non-integrated diagnosis of dementia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,1267,Euro,2005,2090.17
5942,Cost-effectiveness of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement used in primary total hip arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic-impregnated bone cement is infrequently used in the United States for primary total hip arthroplasty because of concerns about cost, performance, and the possible development of antibiotic resistance and because it has been approved only for use in revision arthroplasty after infection. The purpose of this study was to model the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement in primary total hip arthroplasty for the treatment of osteoarthritis to determine whether use of the cement is cost-effective when compared with the use of cement without antibiotics. METHODS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each strategy, we used a Markov decision model to tabulate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accumulated by each patient. Rates of revision due to infection and aseptic loosening were estimated from data in the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register and were used to determine the probability of undergoing a revision arthroplasty because of either infection or aseptic loosening. The primary outcome measure was either all revisions or revision due to infection. Perioperative mortality rates, utilities, and disutilities were estimated from data in the arthroplasty literature. Costs for primary arthroplasty were estimated from data on in-hospital resource use in the literature. The additional cost of using antibiotic-impregnated bone cement ($600) was then added to the average cost of the initial procedure ($21,654). RESULTS: When all revisions were considered to be the primary outcome measure, the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement was found to result in a decrease in overall cost of $200 per patient. When revision due to infection was considered to be the primary outcome measure, the use of the cement was found to have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $37,355 per QALY compared with cement without antibiotics; this cost-effectiveness compares favorably with that of accepted medical procedures. When only revision due to infection was considered, it was found that the additional cost of the antibiotic-impregnated bone cement would need to exceed $650 or the average patient age would need to be greater than seventy-one years before its cost would exceed $50,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: When revision due to either infection or aseptic loosening is considered to be the primary outcome, the use of antibiotic-impregnated bone cement results in an overall cost decrease. When only revision due to infection is considered, the model is strongly influenced by the cost of the cement and the average age of the patients.

5944,The pre-test risk stratified cost-effectiveness of 64-slice computed tomography coronary angiography in the detection of significant obstructive coronary artery disease in patients otherwise referred to invasive coronary angiography,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of 64-slice computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) as an alternative to invasive diagnostic coronary angiography (CA) in an elective outpatient setting for patients otherwise referred to invasive diagnostic coronary angiography. METHODS: Taking the perspective of the Australian health system we used a decision analytic model to integrate data on test accuracy along with complication rates, health state preference weights and health care costs. The analysis is pre-test risk stratified based on Bayes' theorem of conditional probability. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) are the study endpoints expressed as incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The results indicate that CTCA is a cost-saving strategy offering a higher health related quality of life up to approximately 65% pre-test risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Above that threshold the model predicts a cost-utility trade-off with every gain in health related quality of life through the use of CTCA as a rule-out test being associated with additional costs when compared to invasive diagnostic CA. CONCLUSION: This health economic analysis predicts computed tomography coronary angiography to be a cost-effective rule-out strategy in symptomatic patients at low to intermediate risk of significant obstructive coronary artery disease otherwise referred to invasive diagnostic CA.",2009-01-05168,19250870,Heart Lung Circ,Florian P Kreisz,2009,18 / 3,200-7,No,19250870,"Florian P Kreisz; Tracy Merlin; John Moss; John Atherton; Janet E Hiller; Christian A Gericke; The pre-test risk stratified cost-effectiveness of 64-slice computed tomography coronary angiography in the detection of significant obstructive coronary artery disease in patients otherwise referred to invasive coronary angiography, Heart Lung Circ, 2009-Jun; 18(3):1444-2892; 200-7",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Non-invasive coronary angiography using 64-slice computed tomography coronary angiography vs. Invasive traditional, diagnostic coronary angiography",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Years,5.00,5.00,-41588.96,Australia,2006,-40229.47
5945,"Medical decision analysis for the management of unifocal, flat, low-grade dysplasia in ulcerative colitis","BACKGROUND: Management of unifocal, flat, low-grade dysplasia (LGD) in ulcerative colitis (UC) remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To compare the relative costs and effectiveness of immediate colectomy and enhanced colonoscopic surveillance for the management of LGD. DESIGN AND SETTING: Medical decision analysis by using state-transition Markov models. Transition probabilities and health utilities were derived from the literature, and costs were derived from national hospital data sets and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement schedules. PATIENTS: Two simulated cohorts of 10,000 patients with longstanding UC who were newly diagnosed with unifocal, flat LGD on initial surveillance colonoscopy. INTERVENTIONS: Immediate colectomy or enhanced surveillance (repeated colonoscopy at 3, 6, and 12 months, and then annually). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Immediate colectomy dominated over enhanced surveillance and yielded higher QALYs (20.1 vs 19.9 years) and lower costs ($75,900 vs $83,900). These findings were robust to variations in model parameters, with immediate colectomy remaining dominant in 90% of simulations in sensitivity analysis. Varying postcolectomy health utility outside the range in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis rendered enhanced surveillance cost effective. When the health utility was below 0.77, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $50,000 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: Data based on observational studies and analyses rely on model assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis showed that immediate colectomy was preferable to enhanced surveillance. Health preference toward the postcolectomy state is, however, an influential factor.

5946,Cost effectiveness of breast cancer screening with contrast-enhanced MRI in high-risk women,"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of breast cancer screening with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with and without adjunctive x-ray mammography (XM), compared with XM alone in high-risk women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model was developed to depict the consequences of screening with MRI and/or XM for cohorts of 10,000 women with BRCA1/2 mutations and women with other high-risk characteristics, respectively. The model predicted the number of women correctly and incorrectly diagnosed with each strategy and lifetime consequences in terms of additional care, patient utilities, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Cost effectiveness was calculated in terms of cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Among the 400 women (of 10,000) with BRCA1/2 mutations and undiagnosed breast cancer, 361 cases would be detected with MRI and XM, 290 with MRI, and 160 with XM. False-positive results would total 1,526, 1,190, and 528, respectively. Cost per QALY gained with MRI and XM compared with XM alone for women with BRCA1/2 mutations was $25,277. Among other high-risk women, cost per QALY gained with MRI and XM compared with XM alone varied depending on the prevalence of breast cancer, ranging from $45,566 (300 cases) to $310,616 (50 cases). The cost effectiveness of MRI alone compared with XM alone was similar. CONCLUSION: Screening with MRI, alone or in combination with XM, in women with BRCA1/2 mutations is cost effective by current standards compared with XM alone. In women with other high-risk characteristics, MRI screening may also be cost effective, depending on the expected prevalence of undiagnosed breast cancer at the time of screening.",2009-01-05172,19248993,J Am Coll Radiol,Charu Taneja,2009,6 / 3,171-9,No,19248993,"Charu Taneja; John Edelsberg; Derek Weycker; Amy Guo; Gerry Oster; Jeffrey Weinreb; Cost effectiveness of breast cancer screening with contrast-enhanced MRI in high-risk women, J Am Coll Radiol, 2009-Mar; 6(3):1546-1440; 171-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Magnetic resonance imaging of breast tissue with adjuvant x-ray mammograph vs. X-ray mammograph,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,25277,United States,2005,33497.01

RESULTS: Average QALYs (ideally 2.00) for groups 1-4 were 1.29, 1.31, 1.32, and 1.41, respectively, for the British EuroQol (P <or= 0.05 for group 4 versus groups 1-3); 1.41, 1.43, 1.44, and 1.52, respectively, for the Dutch EuroQol (P <or= 0.05 for group 4 versus groups 1-3); and 1.38, 1.38, 1.39, and 1.44, respectively, for the Short Form 6D (P <or= 0.05 for group 4 versus groups 1-3). The Time Trade-Off showed no significant differences. In the primary analysis, using the friction cost method to value productivity, the cost-utility ratio for group 4 against the next best alternative was estimated at euro 130,000 (95% confidence interval euro 27,000, euro 3,000,000) per QALY. Using the human capital method, the value of sustained productivity in group 4 largely compensated for the extra medication costs. CONCLUSION: Initial combination therapy with infliximab for patients with recent-onset active RA resulted in significantly better quality of life than other strategies. Using the friction cost method, costs to achieve this improvement are generally considered too high, and initial combination therapy with prednisone should be preferred.

Its cause is unknown but as many as 30% of patients have continuing facial disfigurement, psychological difficulties and occasionally facial pain. We present an randomised controlled trial (RCT)-based economic evaluation of the early administration of steroids (prednisolone) and/or antivirals (acyclovir) compared to placebo, for treatment of BP. METHODS: The RCT was not powered to detect differences in the cost-effectiveness; therefore, we adopted a decision analytic model approach as a way of gaining precision in our cost-effectiveness comparisons [e.g. prednisolone only (PO) versus acyclovir only versus prednisolone and acyclovir versus placebo, prednisolone versus no prednisolone (NP) and acyclovir versus no acyclovir]. We assumed that trial interventions affect the probability of being cured/not cured but their consequences are independent of the initial therapy. We used the percentage of individuals with a complete recovery (based on House-Brackmann grade = 1) at 9 months and Quality Adjusted Life Years (e.g. derived on responses to the Health Utilities Index III) as measures of effectiveness. Other parameter estimates were obtained from trial data. RESULTS: PO dominated-i.e. was less costly and more effective-all other therapy strategies in the four arms model [77% probability of cost-effective (CE)].

METHODS: Dabigatran etexilate (220 mg once daily) was compared with enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) in patients undergoing TKR (duration of prophylaxis, 6-10 days) and THR (duration of prophylaxis, 28-35 days). The 10-week acute postsurgical phase was modeled using a decision tree. A Markov process (1-year cycle length) was used to model long-term events (recurrent VTE, postthrombotic syndrome, and consequences of intracranial hemorrhage) for patients' remaining lifetimes. Relative risks for VTE and bleeding events were derived from 2 Phase III studies that compared dabigatran etexilate with enoxaparin 40 mg once daily. The probabilities of long-term events were estimated using data from published longitudinal studies. RESULTS: Rates of VTE and bleeding events did not differ significantly between dabigatran etexilate and enoxaparin. Dabigatran etexilate was less costly than enoxaparin in TKR and substantially less costly in THR, primarily due to differences in administration costs. The cost of prophylaxis for THR patients, including drugs and administration costs, was estimated at pound 137 for dabigatran etexilate and pound 237 for enoxaparin ( pound 7 for nursing time during the hospital stay, pound 91 for nurse home visits for administration after hospital discharge, and an additional pound 2 in drug costs). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound 20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, the probability of cost-effectiveness for dabigatran etexilate was 75% in TKR and 97% in THR. These results were robust across a range of sensitivity analyses.

5957,Cost effectiveness of venlafaxine compared with generic fluoxetine or generic amitriptyline in major depressive disorder in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of venlafaxine compared with generic fluoxetine and generic amitriptyline used in major depressive disorder in primary care in the UK. METHODS: A decision-tree model for the treatment of major depressive disorder was constructed using a Delphi panel. The tree was populated with clinical success rates from a pooled analysis of fluoxetine compared with venlafaxine and a clinical trial of amitriptyline compared with venlafaxine using remission as the key endpoint. Where there was insufficient data from clinical trials, the Delphi panel was used. Costs within the tree were taken from contemporary UK sources. Six-monthly costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were then estimated. RESULTS: Treatment costs for 6 months were pound1530 for venlafaxine, pound1539 for fluoxetine and pound1558 for amitriptyline (year of costing 2006). Cost effectiveness as assessed by incremental cost per QALY ratio at 8 weeks was pound20 600 for venlafaxine compared with fluoxetine, with fluoxetine dominating (being less costly and more effective than) amitriptyline. To test the robustness of the model a Rank Order Stability Assessment was performed that showed that even if fluoxetine and/or amitriptyline were given away free, a scenario starting with venlafaxine would still be the least costly treatment over a 6-month period. CONCLUSION: In this model, venlafaxine was shown to be a cost-effective alternative to generic fluoxetine and amitriptyline when used as a first-line therapy.

5958,Cost effectiveness of venlafaxine compared with generic fluoxetine or generic amitriptyline in major depressive disorder in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of venlafaxine compared with generic fluoxetine and generic amitriptyline used in major depressive disorder in primary care in the UK. METHODS: A decision-tree model for the treatment of major depressive disorder was constructed using a Delphi panel. The tree was populated with clinical success rates from a pooled analysis of fluoxetine compared with venlafaxine and a clinical trial of amitriptyline compared with venlafaxine using remission as the key endpoint. Where there was insufficient data from clinical trials, the Delphi panel was used. Costs within the tree were taken from contemporary UK sources. Six-monthly costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were then estimated. RESULTS: Treatment costs for 6 months were pound1530 for venlafaxine, pound1539 for fluoxetine and pound1558 for amitriptyline (year of costing 2006). Cost effectiveness as assessed by incremental cost per QALY ratio at 8 weeks was pound20 600 for venlafaxine compared with fluoxetine, with fluoxetine dominating (being less costly and more effective than) amitriptyline.

5959,Long-term outcome and quality-adjusted life years after severe sepsis,"OBJECTIVE: To study long-term mortality, quality of life (QOL), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs per QALY in an unselected intensive care unit (ICU) patient population with severe sepsis. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Twenty-four ICUs in Finland. PATIENTS: A total of 470 adult patients with severe sepsis who were treated in ICUs between November 1, 2004 and February 28, 2005. The QOL before critical illness was assessed in 252 patients and QOL after severe sepsis in 156 patients (58% of the patients surviving in April 30, 2006). Ninety-eight patients responded to both questionnaires. QOL was assessed by a generic EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) measurement with summary index (EQsum) and visual analogue scale (VAS). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The 2-year mortality after severe sepsis was 44.9% (211 of 470). The median response time for QOL assessment after severe sepsis was 17 months (interquartile range [IQR] 16-18). The median EQsum (75, IQR 56-92) and EQ VAS (66, IQR 50-80) were lower after severe sepsis than age- and sex-adjusted reference values (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). The decrease between the mean EQsum reference value and that of severe sepsis patients was 12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9-16). The difference between the mean EQ VAS reference values and the mean EQ VAS was 8 (95% CI, 5-11). The mean calculated QALYs after severe sepsis were 10.9 (95% CI, 9.7-12.1) and the calculated cost for one QALY was only 2139 [Euro sign] for all survivors and nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS: Two-year mortality after severe sepsis was high (44.9%) and the QOL was lower after severe sepsis than before critical illness as assessed by EQ-5D. However, the mean QALYs for the surviving patients were reasonable and the cost for one QALY was reasonably low, which makes intensive care in patients with severe sepsis cost effective.",2009-01-05180,19242321,Crit Care Med,Sari Karlsson,2009,37 / 4,1268-74,No,19242321,"Sari Karlsson; Esko Ruokonen; Tero Varpula; Tero I Ala-Kokko; Ville Pettilä; Long-term outcome and quality-adjusted life years after severe sepsis, Crit Care Med, 2009-Apr; 37(4):0090-3493; 1268-74",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment for sepsis in intensive care unit (ICU) vs. No intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,17 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,2139,Euro,2005,3528.71
5960,Fluoxetine and imipramine: are there differences in cost-utility for depression in primary care?,"RATIONALE: Depressive disorders generate severe personal burden and high economic costs. Cost-utility analyses of the different therapeutical options are crucial to policy-makers and clinicians. Previous cost-utility studies, comparing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, have used modelling techniques or have not included indirect costs in the economic analyses. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-utility of fluoxetine compared with imipramine for treating depressive disorders in primary care. METHODS: A 6-month randomized prospective naturalistic study comparing fluoxetine with imipramine was conducted in three primary care centres in Spain. One hundred and three patients requiring antidepressant treatment for a DSM-IV depressive disorder were included in the study. Patients were randomized either to fluoxetine (53 patients) or to imipramine (50 patients) treatment. Patients were treated with antidepressants according to their general practitioner's usual clinical practice. Outcome measures were the quality of life tariff of the European Quality of Life Questionnaire: EuroQoL-5D (five domains), direct costs, indirect costs and total costs. Subjects were evaluated at the beginning of treatment and after 1, 3 and 6 months. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) were obtained. To address uncertainty in the ICUR's sampling distribution, non-parametric bootstrapping was carried out. RESULTS: Taking into account adjusted total costs and incremental quality of life gained, imipramine dominated fluoxetine with 81.5% of the bootstrap replications in the dominance quadrant. CONCLUSION: Imipramine seems to be a better cost-utility antidepressant option for treating depressive disorders in primary care.",2009-01-05182,19239602,J Eval Clin Pract,Antoni Serrano-Blanco,2009,15 / 1,195-203,No,19239602,"Antoni Serrano-Blanco; David Suárez; Alejandra Pinto-Meza; Maria T Peñarrubia; Josep Maria Haro; Fluoxetine and imipramine: are there differences in cost-utility for depression in primary care?, J Eval Clin Pract, 2009-Feb; 15(1):1356-1294; 195-203",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fluoxetine (mean starting dosage: 19.4 mg) vs. Imipramine (mean starting dosage: 33.5 mg),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Euro,2007,Not Stated
5961,Cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy for menopausal symptoms in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of five-year treatment of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) compared with no treatment for women with menopausal symptoms in the UK. METHOD: A Markov cohort simulation model with tunnel techniques was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of HRT in women aged 50 years. For the clinical effects of HRT we used, where possible, results taken from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). The model had a life-time horizon with cycle lengths of one year and contained the following disease states: hip fracture, vertebral fracture, wrist fracture, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and venous thromboembolic events. An intervention was modelled by its impact on the disease risks during and after stopping treatment. The model was populated with UK-specific data on risks, mortality rates, quality-of-life weights and costs. The main outcome of the model was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of HRT compared with no treatment. RESULTS: The results indicated that it was cost-effective to treat women with menopausal symptoms with HRT in the UK. The severity of menopausal symptoms was the single most important determinant of cost-effectiveness, but HRT remained cost-effective even where symptoms were mild or effects on symptom relief were small.

5963,Cost-effectiveness of treating influenzalike illness with oseltamivir in the United States,"PURPOSE: The cost-effectiveness of treating influenzalike illness (ILI) with oseltamivir in the United States was assessed. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was developed with a one-year time horizon to assess the cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir compared with usual care from societal and payer perspectives for four patient populations: high-risk adults, healthy adults, elderly adults, and children. The model used efficacy data from oseltamivir clinical trials and other published literature and assumed oseltamivir was effective only in individuals infected with influenza virus not resistant to oseltamivir and treated within 48 hours of symptom onset. Direct medical costs were based on resources used; indirect costs were estimated based on time lost from work due to illness and premature mortality. Base-case estimates were tested in one-way sensitivity and variability analyses. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, oseltamivir was cost-effective across all populations modeled, with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained of $5,388, $6,317, $7,652, and $16,176 for high-risk adults, children, elderly adults, and healthy adults, respectively. Results were similar from a payer perspective. When indirect costs were included (for all populations except elderly adults), oseltamivir was cost saving. In sensitivity analyses, oseltamivir remained cost-effective across all patient populations for all values tested, except the probability of developing influenza-related pneumonia. Variability analyses showed that oseltamivir remained cost-effective under most scenarios tested.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A model was designed to simulate the costs and benefits of treatment of OSAH with OA or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) based on their effects on quality of life, motor vehicle crashes, and cardiovascular effects. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in terms of costs per one quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained 5 years after treatment. RESULTS: Compared with no treatment, OA results in $268 higher costs and an incremental QALY of 0.0899 per patient (ICER = $2,984/QALY). Compared with OA, CPAP resulted in $1,917 more costs and 0.0696 additional QALYs (ICER = $27,540/QALY). For the most part in the sensitivity analyses, CPAP remained cost-effective compared to OA, and OA remained cost-effective with respect to no treatment in almost all scenarios.

5970,Quality of life after late invasive therapy for occluded arteries,"BACKGROUND: The open-artery hypothesis postulates that late opening of an infarct-related artery after myocardial infarction will improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the quality-of-life and economic outcomes associated with the use of this strategy. METHODS: We compared percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) plus stenting with medical therapy alone in high-risk patients in stable condition who had a totally occluded infarct-related artery 3 to 28 days after myocardial infarction. In 951 patients (44% of those eligible), we assessed quality of life by means of a battery of tests that included two principal outcome measures, the Duke Activity Status Index (DASI) (which measures cardiac physical function on a scale from 0 to 58, with higher scores indicating better function) and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Mental Health Inventory 5 (which measures psychological well-being). Structured quality-of-life interviews were performed at baseline and at 4, 12, and 24 months. Costs of treatment were assessed for 458 of 469 patients in the United States (98%), and 2-year cost-effectiveness was estimated. RESULTS: At 4 months, the medical-therapy group, as compared with the PCI group, had a clinically marginal decrease of 3.4 points in the DASI score (P=0.007). At 1 and 2 years, the differences were smaller. No significant differences in psychological well-being were observed. For the 469 patients in the United States, cumulative 2-year costs were approximately $7,000 higher in the PCI group (P<0.001), and the quality-adjusted survival was marginally longer in the medical-therapy group. CONCLUSIONS: PCI was associated with a marginal advantage in cardiac physical function at 4 months but not thereafter. At 2 years, medical therapy remained significantly less expensive than routine PCI and was associated with marginally longer quality-adjusted survival.

5971,A pharmaco-economic analysis of patients with schizophrenia switching to generic risperidone involving a possible compliance loss,"BACKGROUND: As schizophrenia patients are typically suspicious of, or are hostile to changes they may be reluctant to accept generic substitution, possibly affecting compliance. This may counteract drug costs savings due to less symptom control and increased hospitalization risk. Although compliance losses following generic substitution have not been quantified so far, one can estimate the possible health-economic consequences. The current study aims to do so by considering the case of risperidone in Germany. METHODS: An existing DES model was adapted to compare staying on branded risperidone with generic substitution. Differences include the probability of non-compliance and medication costs. Incremental probability of non-compliance after generic substitution was varied between 2.5% and 10%, while generic medication costs were assumed to be 40% lower. Effect of medication price was assessed as well as the effect of applying compliance losses to all treatment settings. The probability of staying on branded risperidone being cost-effective was calculated for various outcomes of a hypothetical study that would investigate non-compliance following generic substitution of risperidone. RESULTS: If the incremental probability of non-compliance after generic substitution is 2.5%, 5.0%, 7.5% and 10% respectively, incremental effects of staying on branded risperidone are 0.004, 0.007, 0.011 and 0.015 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Incremental costs are euro757, euro343, -euro123 and -euro554 respectively. Benefits of staying on branded risperidone include improved symptom control and fewer hospitalizations. If generic substitution results in a 5.2% higher probability of non-compliance, the model predicts staying on branded risperidone to be cost-effective (NICE threshold of 30,000 per QALY gained). Compliance losses of more than 6.9% makes branded risperidone the dominant alternative. Results are sensitive to the locations at which compliance loss is applied and the price of generic risperidone. The probability that staying on branded risperidone is cost-effective would increase with larger compliance differences and more patients included in the hypothetical study. CONCLUSION: The model predicts that it is cost-effective to keep a patient with schizophrenia in Germany on branded risperidone instead of switching him/her to generic risperidone (assuming a 40% reduction in medication costs), if the incremental probability of becoming non-compliant after generic substitution exceeds 5.2%.",2009-01-05204,19226465,BMC Health Serv Res,Maarten Treur,2009,9 /,32,Yes,19226465,"Maarten Treur; Bart Heeg; Hans-Jürgen Möller; Annette Schmeding; Ben van Hout; A pharmaco-economic analysis of patients with schizophrenia switching to generic risperidone involving a possible compliance loss, BMC Health Serv Res, 2009; 9():1472-6963; 32",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Generic subsitition with 2.5% probability of non-compliance vs. Staying on branded risperidone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,196243,Euro,2007,335851.3

5979,Comparing impact and cost-effectiveness of primary prevention strategies for lipid-lowering,"BACKGROUND: Lipid-lowering therapy is costly but effective at reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness and public health impact of Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines and compare with a range of risk- and age-based alternative strategies. DESIGN: The CHD Policy Model, a Markov-type cost-effectiveness model. DATA SOURCES: National surveys (1999 to 2004), vital statistics (2000), the Framingham Heart Study (1948 to 2000), other published data, and a direct survey of statin costs (2008). TARGET POPULATION: U.S. population age 35 to 85 years. Time Horizon: 2010 to 2040. PERSPECTIVE: Health care system. INTERVENTION: Lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Full adherence to ATP III primary prevention guidelines would require starting (9.7 million) or intensifying (1.4 million) statin therapy for 11.1 million adults and would prevent 20,000 myocardial infarctions and 10,000 CHD deaths per year at an annual net cost of $3.6 billion ($42,000/QALY) if low-intensity statins cost $2.11 per pill. The ATP III guidelines would be preferred over alternative strategies if society is willing to pay $50,000/QALY and statins cost $1.54 to $2.21 per pill. At higher statin costs, ATP III is not cost-effective; at lower costs, more liberal statin-prescribing strategies would be preferred; and at costs less than $0.10 per pill, treating all persons with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels greater than 3.4 mmol/L (>130 mg/dL) would yield net cost savings. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results are sensitive to the assumptions that LDL cholesterol becomes less important as a risk factor with increasing age and that little disutility results from taking a pill every day. LIMITATION: Randomized trial evidence for statin effectiveness is not available for all subgroups. CONCLUSION: The ATP III guidelines are relatively cost-effective and would have a large public health impact if implemented fully in the United States. Alternate strategies may be preferred, however, depending on the cost of statins and how much society is willing to pay for better health outcomes.

5980,Cost-effectiveness of insulin analogues for diabetes mellitus,"BACKGROUND: Insulin analogues may be associated with fewer episodes of hypoglycemia than conventional insulins. However, they are costly alternatives. We compared the cost-effectiveness of insulin analogues and conventional insulins used to treat type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness evaluation of insulin analogues versus conventional insulins using the Center for Outcomes Research Diabetes Model. We compared rapid-acting analogues (insulin aspart and insulin lispro) with regular human insulin, and long-acting analogues (insulin glargine and insulin detemir) with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin. We derived clinical information for the comparisons from meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials. We obtained cost and utility estimates from published sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results. RESULTS: For type 1 diabetes, insulin aspart was more effective and less costly than regular human insulin. Insulin lispro was associated with an incremental cost of Can$28,996 per quality-adjusted life-year. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year was Can$87,932 for insulin glargine and Can$387,729 for insulin detemir, compared with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin. For type 2 diabetes, insulin aspart was associated with an incremental cost of Can$22,488 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with regular human insulin. For insulin lispro, the incremental cost was Can$130,865. Compared with neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin, insulin detemir was less effective and more costly. Insulin glargine was associated with an incremental cost of Can$642,994 per quality-adjusted life-year. The model was sensitive to changes in the effect size of hemoglobin A(1c) and to decrements applied to utility scores when fear of hypoglycemia was included as a factor. INTERPRETATION: The cost-effectiveness of insulin analogues depends on the type of insulin analogue and whether the patient receiving the treatment has type 1 or type 2 diabetes.

5990,Cost-effectiveness analysis of lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir+ritonavir regimens in the CASTLE study,"INTRODUCTION: The purpose of the study was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis and budget impact analysis comparing lopinavir with ritonavir (LPV/r) and atazanavir plus ritonavir (ATV+RTV) for antiretroviral-naïve patients with a baseline CD4+ T-cell distribution and total cholesterol (TC) profile as reported in the CASTLE study. METHODS: This decision analysis study used a previously published Markov model of HIV disease, incorporating coronary heart disease (CHD) events to compare the short- and long-term budget impacts and CHD consequences expected for the two regimens. RESULTS: Patients were assumed to have a baseline CHD risk of 4.6% (based on demographic data) and it was also assumed that 50% of the population in the CASTLE study were smokers. The CHD risk differences (based on percent of patients with TC >240 mg/dL) in favor of ATV+RTV resulted in an average improvement in life expectancy of 0.031 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (11 days), and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,409,734/QALY. Use of the LPV/r regimen saved $24,518 and $36,651 at 5 and 10 years, respectively, with lifetime cost savings estimated at $38,490. A sensitivity analysis using a cohort of all smokers on antihypertensive medication estimated an average improvement in life expectancy of 31 quality-adjusted days in favor of ATV+RTV, and a cost-effectiveness ratio of $520,861/QALY: a ratio that is still above the acceptable limit within the US. CONCLUSION: The use of an LPV/r-based regimen in antiretroviral-naïve patients with a baseline CHD risk similar to patients in the CASTLE study appears to be a more cost-effective use of resources compared with an ATV+RTV-based regimen. The very small added CHD risk predicted by LPV/r treatment is more than offset by the substantial short- and long-term cost savings expected with the use of LPV/r in antiretroviral-naïve individuals with average to moderately elevated CHD risk.",2009-01-05213,19219410,Adv Ther,Kit N Simpson,2009,26 / 2,185-93,No,19219410,"Kit N Simpson; Rukmini Rajagopalan; Birgitta Dietz; Cost-effectiveness analysis of lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir+ritonavir regimens in the CASTLE study, Adv Ther, 2009-Feb; 26(2):0741-238X; 185-93",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,lopinavir with ritonavir (LPV/r) vs. atazanavir plus ritonavir (ATV+RTV),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1241612.88,United States,2007,1549821.41
5991,Cost-utility analysis of the National truth campaign to prevent youth smoking,"BACKGROUND: In 2005, the American Journal of Public Health published an article that indicated that 22% of the overall decline in youth smoking that occurred between 1999 and 2002 was directly attributable to the truth social marketing campaign launched in 2000. A remaining key question about the truth campaign is whether the economic investment in the program can be justified by the public health outcomes; that question is examined here. METHODS: Standard methods of cost and cost-utility analysis were employed in accordance with the U.S. Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine; a societal perspective was employed. RESULTS: During 2000-2002, expenditures totaled just over $324 million to develop, deliver, evaluate, and litigate the truth campaign. The base-case cost-utility analysis result indicates that the campaign was cost saving; it is estimated that the campaign recouped its costs and that just under $1.9 billion in medical costs was averted for society. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the basic determination of cost effectiveness for this campaign is robust to substantial variation in input parameters.

5992,Cost effectiveness of nurse delivered endoscopy: findings from randomised multi-institution nurse endoscopy trial (MINuET),"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost effectiveness of nurses and doctors in performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy. DESIGN: As part of a pragmatic randomised trial, the economic analysis calculated incremental cost effectiveness ratios, and generated cost effectiveness acceptability curves to address uncertainty. SETTING: 23 hospitals in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 67 doctors and 30 nurses, with a total of 1888 patients, from July 2002 to June 2003. INTERVENTION: Diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy carried out by doctors or nurses. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Estimated health gains in QALYs measured with EQ-5D. Probability of cost effectiveness over a range of decision makers' willingness to pay for an additional quality adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Although differences did not reach traditional levels of significance, patients in the doctor group gained 0.015 QALYs more than those in the nurse group, at an increased cost of about pound56 (euro59, $78) per patient. This yields an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of pound3660 (euro3876, $5097) per QALY. Though there is uncertainty around these results, doctors are probably more cost effective than nurses for plausible values of a QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Though upper gastrointestinal endoscopies and flexible sigmoidoscopies carried out by doctors cost slightly more than those by nurses and improved health outcomes only slightly, our analysis favours endoscopies by doctors. For plausible values of decision makers' willingness to pay for an extra QALY, endoscopy delivered by nurses is unlikely to be cost effective compared with endoscopy delivered by doctors.

5993,The cost-effectiveness of increasing kidney transplantation and home-based dialysis,"BACKGROUND: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) consumes sizable proportions of health budgets internationally, but there is considerable variability in choice of RRT modality among and within countries with major implications for health outcomes and costs. We aimed to quantify these implications for increasing kidney transplantation and improving the rate of home-based dialysis. METHODS: A multiple cohort Markov model was used to assess costs and health outcomes of RRT for new end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients in Australia for 2005-2010, using a health-care funder perspective. Patient characteristics and current practice patterns were based on the ANZDATA Registry. Two proposed changes were modelled: (i) increasing kidney transplants by between 10% and 50% by 2010; and (ii) increasing home haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) to the highest rates observed among Australian centres. We assessed costs (Australian dollars), survival and quality-adjusted survival, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The number of new ESKD patients in 2010 was estimated to be 2700, with annual RRT costs of about $A700 million; cumulative costs (2005-2010) were $A5 billion. Increasing transplants by 10-50% saves between $A5.8 and $A26.2 million, and increases quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 130-658 QALYs.

5994,The cost-effectiveness of increasing kidney transplantation and home-based dialysis,"BACKGROUND: Renal replacement therapy (RRT) consumes sizable proportions of health budgets internationally, but there is considerable variability in choice of RRT modality among and within countries with major implications for health outcomes and costs. We aimed to quantify these implications for increasing kidney transplantation and improving the rate of home-based dialysis. METHODS: A multiple cohort Markov model was used to assess costs and health outcomes of RRT for new end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients in Australia for 2005-2010, using a health-care funder perspective. Patient characteristics and current practice patterns were based on the ANZDATA Registry. Two proposed changes were modelled: (i) increasing kidney transplants by between 10% and 50% by 2010; and (ii) increasing home haemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) to the highest rates observed among Australian centres. We assessed costs (Australian dollars), survival and quality-adjusted survival, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The number of new ESKD patients in 2010 was estimated to be 2700, with annual RRT costs of about $A700 million; cumulative costs (2005-2010) were $A5 billion. Increasing transplants by 10-50% saves between $A5.8 and $A26.2 million, and increases quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 130-658 QALYs. Switching new patients from hospital HD to (i) home HD saves $A46.6 million by 2010; or (ii) PD saves $A122.1 million. CONCLUSIONS: These clinical practice changes reduce costs, improve patient quality of life and, in the case of transplantation, increase survival.

5995,Cost-effectiveness of HIV nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis in Australia,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of HIV nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis (NPEP) in Australia. METHODS: A retrospective cost analysis of a population-based observational cohort of 1601 participants eligible for NPEP in Australia between 1998 and 2004 was carried out. We modelled NPEP treatment costs and combined them with effectiveness outcomes to calculate the cost per seroconversion avoided. We estimated the cost-utility of the programme, and sensitivity and threshold analysis was performed on key variables. RESULTS: The average NPEP cost per patient was A$1616, of which A$848 (52%) was for drugs, A$331 (21%) for consultations, A$225 (14%) for pathology and A$212 (13%) for other costs. The cost per seroconversion avoided in the cohort was A$1 647,476 in our base case analysis, and A$512,410 when transmission rates were set at their maximal values. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was between A$40,673 and A$176,772, depending on the risks of HIV transmission assumed. CONCLUSIONS: In our base case, NPEP was not a cost-effective intervention compared with the widely accepted Australian threshold of A$50,000 per QALY. It was only cost-effective after receptive unprotected anal intercourse exposure to an HIV-positive source.
