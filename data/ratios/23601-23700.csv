23601,Cost and cost-effectiveness of a simplified treatment model with direct-acting antivirals for chronic hepatitis C in Cambodia,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In 2016, Medecins Sans Frontieres established the first general population Hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening and treatment site in Cambodia, offering free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment. This study analysed the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. METHODS: Costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost-effectiveness of the intervention were projected with a Markov model over a lifetime horizon, discounted at 3%/year. Patient-level resource-use and outcome data, treatment costs, costs of HCV-related healthcare and EQ-5D-5L health states were collected from an observational cohort study evaluating the effectiveness of DAA treatment under full and simplified models of care compared to no treatment; other model parameters were derived from literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost/QALY gained) were compared to an opportunity cost-based willingness-to-pay threshold for Cambodia ($248/QALY). RESULTS: The total cost of testing and treatment per patient for the full model of care was $925(IQR $668-1631), reducing to $376(IQR $344-422) for the simplified model of care. EQ-5D-5L values varied by fibrosis stage: decompensated cirrhosis had the lowest value, values increased during and following treatment. The simplified model of care was cost saving compared to no treatment, while the full model of care, although cost-effective compared to no treatment ($187/QALY), cost an additional $14 485/QALY compared to the simplified model, above the willingness-to-pay threshold for Cambodia. This result is robust to variation in parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The simplified model of care was cost saving compared to no treatment, emphasizing the importance of simplifying pathways of care for improving access to HCV treatment in low-resource settings.

23603,Colchicine Prophylaxis of Gout Flares When Commencing Allopurinol is Very Cost Effective,"OBJECTIVE: Colchicine prophylaxis to prevent gout flares when commencing urate lowering therapy is recommended by international rheumatology society guidelines. Whether this is a cost-effective intervention is currently unknown. Our objective was to perform a cost effectiveness analysis using both a United States cost input model and an Australian cost input model. METHODS: This cost-effectiveness analysis was completed from the point of view of the third-party payer. We used a two-arm decision-tree with one arm commencing allopurinol with no colchicine prophylaxis and the other with colchicine prophylaxis. Model inputs were drawn from published literature, where available. We completed univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to confirm the robust nature of the modelling. The time frame for the model was 6 months. RESULTS: The colchicine prophylaxis arm resulted in a cost of US$1276 and 0.49 quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) while in the placebo arm the cost was US$516 and 0.47 QALYs, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$34,004 per QALY gained. In Australia where cost of colchicine was much lower, the colchicine arm dominated the placebo (A$208 in colchicine arm vs. A$415 in placebo). Univariate and probability sensitivity analysis demonstrated that results were robust to changes in input parameters. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability of colchicine prophylaxis being the most cost-effective option was 93% in the United States and 100% in Australian setting.

23605,Economic Modelling of Screen-and-Treat Strategies for Brazilian Women at Risk of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Clinical evidence supports the use of genetic counselling and BRCA1/2 testing for women at risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Currently, screen-and-treat strategies are not reimbursed in the Brazilian Unified Healthcare System (SUS). The aim of this modelling study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a gene-based screen-and-treat strategy for BRCA1/2 in women with a high familial risk followed by preventive interventions compared with no screening. METHODS: Adopting the SUS perspective, a Markov model with a lifelong time horizon was developed for a cohort of healthy women aged 30 years that fulfilled the criteria for BRCA1/2 testing according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline. For women who tested positive, preventive options included intensified surveillance, risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. The Markov model comprised the health states ''well'', ''breast cancer'', ''death'' and two post-cancer states. Outcomes were the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and the incremental costs per life-year gained (LYG). Data were mainly obtained by a literature review. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In the base case, the screen-and-treat strategy resulted in additional costs of 3515 Brazilian reais (R$) (US$1698) and a gain of 0.145 QALYs, compared with no screening. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was R$24,263 (US$21,724) per QALY and R$27,258 (US$24,405) per LYG. Applying deterministic sensitivity analyses, the ICER was most sensitive to the probability of a positive test result and the discount rate. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, a willingness to pay of R$25,000 per QALY gained for the screen-and-treat strategy resulted in a probability of cost effectiveness of 80%. CONCLUSION: Although there is no rigorous cost-effectiveness threshold in Brazil, the result of this cost-effectiveness analysis may support the inclusion of BRCA1/2 testing for women at high-risk of cancer in the SUS. The ICER calculated for the provision of genetic testing for BRCA1/2 approximates the cost-effectiveness threshold proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for low- and middle-income countries.",2020-01-33335,0,J.

23606,Economic evaluation of colorectal cancer screening programs: Affordability for the health service,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the public colorectal cancer screening program in the Abruzzo region, Italy. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was analysed using a two-armed Markov model comparing: (1) Abruzzo screening program based on biennial faecal immunochemical occult blood testing, with colonoscopy as second level test for individuals with positive results, with (2) Treatment of symptomatic patients according to the stage of the neoplasm. Transition probabilities were adjusted for accuracy of tests and incidence of colorectal cancer. Diagnosis-related groups'' charges and field collected data were used to estimate costs. Costs and benefits were discounted by 3.5%. Monte Carlo simulation confirmed the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: Assuming a compliance rate of 64.7%, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the current colorectal screening program was 433.06/quality adjusted life year gained, considerably lower than conventional thresholds (around 30,000). CONCLUSION: Early detection and intervention programs help to avoid a large number of highly debilitating and expensive cancer treatments.

23607,Cost-Utility Analysis of Ravulizumab Compared with Eculizumab in Adult Patients with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria,"BACKGROUND: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, characterized by intravascular hemolysis and venous thrombosis, can be managed with eculizumab, an inhibitor of the complement system; however, patients may periodically experience breakthrough hemolysis. Ravulizumab is a newly approved treatment for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria that may reduce breakthrough hemolysis risk, thus improving health-related quality of life and reducing treatment costs. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the costs and benefit of treatment with ravulizumab vs eculizumab in adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, from a US payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a semi-Markov model, informed by clinical experts. Lifetime costs and benefit (quality-adjusted life-years) (both discounted at 3% per annum) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated, over a lifetime horizon. Results are reported for an entire treated population and subgroups of eculizumab treatment history. Scenario analyses were characterized by assumptions of non-inferiority between treatments, in terms of breakthrough hemolysis incidence and blood transfusion requirements, and of variations in eculizumab dosing adjustments used in response to breakthrough hemolysis. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis for the overall population, there was a positive impact on health-related quality of life (quality-adjusted life-year gain of 1.67) and costs were lower (- $1,673,465), for ravulizumab vs eculizumab. This led to a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (- $1,000,818, indicating cost savings per quality-adjusted life-year gained). Health-related quality-of-life improvement and cost savings were also observed in all cohorts and scenario analyses.

23611,"A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Safety, Efficacy, and Cost-effectiveness of the Surgisis Anal Fistula Plug Versus Surgeon's Preference for Transsphincteric Fistula-in-Ano: The FIAT Trial","OBJECTIVE: To undertake a randomized comparison of the Biodesign Surgisis anal fistula plug against surgeon''s preference in treating cryptoglandular transsphincteric fistula-in-ano. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The efficacy of the Biodesign Surgisis anal fistula plug in healing anal fistulae is uncertain. METHODS: Participants were randomized to the fistula plug with surgeon''s preference (advancement flap, cutting seton, fistulotomy, Ligation of the Intersphincteric Fistula Tract procedure). The primary outcome was faecal incontinence quality of life (FIQoL) at 12-months. Secondary outcomes were fistula healing, incontinence rates, and complication and reintervention rates. RESULTS: Between May 2011 and March 2016, 304 participants were randomized to fistula plug or surgeon''s preference. No differences were seen in FIQoL between the 2 groups at 12 months. Clinical fistula healing was reported in 66/122 (54%) of the fistula plug and 66/119 (55%) of the surgeon''s preference groups at 12 months. Fecal incontinence rates improved marginally in both the groups. Complications and reinterventions were frequent, with significantly more complications in the fistula plug group at 6-weeks (49/142, 35% vs 25/137, 18%; P=0.002). The mean total costs were 2738 (s.d. 1151) for the fistula plug and 2308 (s.d. 1228) for the surgeon''s preference group (mean difference +430, P=0.0174). The average total quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained was marginally higher in the fistula plug group. The fistula plug was 35% to 45% likely to be cost-effective across a willingness to pay threshold of 20,000 to 30,000 / QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The Biodesign Surgisis anal fistula plug is associated with similar FIQoL and healing rates to surgeon''s preference at 12 months. Higher costs and highly uncertain gains in QALYs mean that the fistula plug may not be considered as a cost-effective treatment in the UK NHS.",2020-01-33342,0,Dig. Dis.

23612,Cost-effectiveness of fiberoptic laryngoscopy prior to total thyroidectomy for low-risk thyroid cancer patients,"BACKGROUND: Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy is performed prior to thyroid surgery to evaluate the function of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. We assess the cost-effectiveness of preoperative laryngoscopy prior to total thyroidectomy for a low-risk thyroid cancer patient without dysphonia. METHODS: A decision tree analysis was performed from a third-party payer perspective. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of fiberoptic laryngoscopy prior to total thyroidectomy for T2N0M0 papillary thyroid carcinoma, such that an ipsilateral vocal fold paralysis alters the surgical plan to hemi-thyroidectomy, when permissible, to avoid the risk of bilateral vocal fold paralysis. RESULTS: Performing preoperative laryngoscopy to assess vocal fold function has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 45 193 USD/QALY compared to no laryngoscopy. At a willingness-to-pay of 100 K/QALY, the intervention is cost-effective if the incidence of vocal fold paralysis is at least 0.57%, or when the permissible rate of hemithyroidectomy in cases of incidental paralysis is at least 41%. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that laryngoscopy is cost-effective in 90.9% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Fiberoptic laryngoscopy is a cost-effective prior to total thyroidectomy in asymptomatic, low-risk thyroid cancer patients.

23613,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Immediate Access Arteriovenous Grafts Versus Standard Grafts for Hemodialysis,"OBJECTIVES: Immediate access arteriovenous grafts (IAAVGs), or early cannulation arteriovenous grafts, are more expensive than standard grafts (sAVGs) but can be used immediately after placement, reducing the need for a tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC). We hypothesized that a decrease in TDC-related complications would make IAAVGs a cost-effective alternative to sAVGs. METHODS: We constructed a Markov state transition model in which patients initially received either (1) an IAAVG or (2) a sAVG, and a TDC until graft usability; patients were followed through multiple subsequent access procedures for a 60-month time horizon. The model simulated mortality and typical graft- and TDC-related complications, with parameter estimates including probabilities, costs, and utilities derived from previous literature. A key parameter was median time to TDC removal after graft placement, which was studied under both real-world (7 days for IAAVG and 70 days for sAVG) and ideal conditions (no TDC placed with IAAVG and 1 month for sAVG). Costs were based on current Medicare reimbursement rates and reflect a payer perspective. Both microsimulation (10,000 trials) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (10,000 samples) were performed. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: IAAVG placement is a dominant strategy, both under real-world ($1,201.16 less expensive and 0.03 QALYs more effective) and ideal conditions ($1,457.97 less expensive and 0.03 QALYs more effective). Under real-world parameters, the result was most sensitive to the time to TDC removal: IAAVGs are cost-effective if a TDC is maintained for >=23 days after sAVG placement. The mean catheter time was lower with IAAVG (3.9 vs. 8.7 months, P < .0001), as was the mean number of access-related infections (0.55 vs. 0.74, P < .0001). Median survival in the model was 29 months. Overall mortality was similar between groups (76.3% vs. 76.7% at five years, P = .33), but access-related mortality trended toward improvement with IAAVG (6.1% vs. 6.8% at five years, P = .052). CONCLUSIONS: The Markov decision-analysis model supported our hypothesis that IAAVGs come with added initial cost but are ultimately cost-saving and more effective. This apparent benefit is due to our prediction that a decreased number of catheter-days per patient would lead to a decreased number of access-related infections. Copyright © 2020.

23614,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Immediate Access Arteriovenous Grafts Versus Standard Grafts for Hemodialysis,"OBJECTIVES: Immediate access arteriovenous grafts (IAAVGs), or early cannulation arteriovenous grafts, are more expensive than standard grafts (sAVGs) but can be used immediately after placement, reducing the need for a tunneled dialysis catheter (TDC). We hypothesized that a decrease in TDC-related complications would make IAAVGs a cost-effective alternative to sAVGs. METHODS: We constructed a Markov state transition model in which patients initially received either (1) an IAAVG or (2) a sAVG, and a TDC until graft usability; patients were followed through multiple subsequent access procedures for a 60-month time horizon. The model simulated mortality and typical graft- and TDC-related complications, with parameter estimates including probabilities, costs, and utilities derived from previous literature. A key parameter was median time to TDC removal after graft placement, which was studied under both real-world (7 days for IAAVG and 70 days for sAVG) and ideal conditions (no TDC placed with IAAVG and 1 month for sAVG).

23615,Action Seniors! Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Secondary Falls Prevention Strategy Among Community-Dwelling Older Fallers,"BACKGROUND: The Otago Exercise Program (OEP) has demonstrated cost-effectiveness for the primary prevention of falls in a general community setting. The cost-effectiveness of exercise as a secondary falls prevention (ie, preventing falls among those who have already fallen) strategy remains unknown. The primary objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness (incremental cost-effectiveness/utility ratio) of the OEP from a healthcare system perspective. DESIGN: A concurrent 12-month prospective economic evaluation conducted alongside the Action Seniors! randomized critical trial (OEP compared with usual care). SETTING: Vancouver Falls Prevention Clinic (Vancouver, BC, Canada; http://www.fallsclinic.ca). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 344 community-dwelling older adults, aged 70 years and older, who attended a geriatrician-led Falls Prevention Clinic in Vancouver, after sustaining a fall in the previous 12 months. MEASUREMENTS: Main outcome measures included: incidence rate ratio for falls, healthcare costs, incremental cost per fall prevented, and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The OEP costs $393 CAD per participant to implement. The incremental cost per fall prevented resulted in a savings of $2 CAD. The incremental cost per QALY gained (where QALYs were estimated using the Euro-Qol 5D three-level version [EQ-5D-3L]) indicated the OEP was less effective than usual care. The incremental cost per QALY gained (where QALYs were estimated using the Short Form 6D [SF-6D]) indicated the OEP was more effective and less costly than usual care. The incremental QALYs estimated using the EQ-5D-3L and the SF-6D were not clinically significant and close to zero, indicating no change in quality of life. CONCLUSION: Compared with usual care, healthcare system costs are saved and falls are prevented when older fallers who attend a geriatrician-led falls clinic are allocated to, and provided, the physiotherapist-guided exercise-based falls prevention program (the OEP).

23619,Thyroidectomy for euthyroid patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis and persisting symptoms: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Despite thyroid hormone replacement, some euthyroid patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis will continue to experience persistent symptoms that reduce their quality of life. Recent studies indicate that total thyroidectomy is superior to medical therapy alone in improving these symptoms. However, there is a high complication rate after total thyroidectomy in patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of total thyroidectomy for euthyroid patients who have Hashimoto thyroiditis with persistent symptoms. METHODS: We utilized a Markov model to compare total thyroidectomy and medical therapy alone over the lifetime of the cohort. Costs, probabilities, and utility parameters were derived from literature and Medicare cost data. A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life years was used. We performed sensitivity analyses to ascertain model uncertainty. RESULTS: On average, medical therapy alone costs $12,845, produced 16.9 quality-adjusted life years, and was dominated. Total thyroidectomy costs $1,490 less and produced 1.4 more quality-adjusted life years. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirmed total thyroidectomy as the optimal strategy in 89% of cases. Medical therapy alone will become cost-effective if the cost of uncomplicated thyroidectomy increases by 25%, if the probability of permanent complication after total thyroidectomy increases 12-fold, or if there is no gain in quality of life after thyroidectomy. CONCLUSION: Total thyroidectomy is more cost-effective than medical therapy alone for the management of euthyroid patients who have Hashimoto thyroiditis with persistent symptoms.

23620,Economic evaluation of a multimodal intervention in pre-frail and frail older people with diabetes mellitus: the MID-FRAIL project,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of a multi-modal intervention in frail and pre-frail subjects aged >=70 years with type-2 diabetes versus usual care group focused on quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in different European countries. METHODS: The MID-FRAIL study was a cluster randomized multicentre trial conducted in seven European countries. A cost-utility analysis was carried out based on this study, conducted from the perspective of the health care system with a time horizon of one year. Univariate and probabilistic analysis were carried out to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The cost estimation showed the offsetting health effect of the intervention program on total health care costs. The mean annual health care costs were 25% higher among patients in usual care. The mean incremental QALY gained per patient by the intervention group were 0.053 QALY compared with usual care practice. CONCLUSIONS: The MID-FRAIL intervention program showed to be the dominant option in comparison with usual care practice. It saved costs to the health care system and achieved worthwhile health gains.

23621,Economic Evaluation of Cannabinoid Oil for Dravet Syndrome: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Cannabinoid oils are being increasingly used to treat Dravet syndrome, yet the long-term costs and outcomes of this approach are unknown. Thus, we examined the cost effectiveness of cannabinoid oil as an adjunctive treatment (added to clobazam and valproate), compared with adjunctive stiripentol or with clobazam and valproate alone, for the treatment of Dravet syndrome in children. METHODS: We performed a probabilistic cost-utility analysis from the perspective of the Canadian public health care system, comparing cannabinoid oil and stiripentol (both on a background of clobazam and valproate) with clobazam and valproate alone. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated using a Markov model that followed a cohort of children aged from 5 to 18 years through model states related to seizure frequency. Model inputs were obtained from the literature. The cost effectiveness of adjunctive cannabinoid oil, adjunctive stiripentol, and clobazam/valproate alone was assessed through sequential analysis. The influence of perspective and other assumptions were explored in scenario analyses. All costs are expressed in 2019 Canadian dollars, and costs and QALYs were discounted at a rate of 1.5% per year. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained with the use of adjunctive cannabinoid oil, from the health care system perspective, was $32,399 compared with clobazam and valproate. Stiripentol was dominated by cannabinoid oil, producing fewer QALYs at higher costs. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000, cannabinoid oil was the optimal treatment in 76% of replications. From a societal perspective, cannabinoid oil dominated stiripentol and clobazam/valproate. The interpretation of the results was insensitive to model and input assumptions. CONCLUSION: Compared with clobazam/valproate, adjunctive cannabinoid oil may be a cost-effective treatment for Dravet syndrome, if a decision maker is willing to pay at least $32,399 for each QALY gained.

The opportunity costs of continuing to fund stiripentol, but not cannabinoid oil, should be considered.",2020-01-33356,0,Pharmacoeconomics,J Elliott,2020,/,,Yes,Not Stated,"J Elliott; B McCoy; T Clifford; BK Potter; GA Wells; D Coyle; Economic Evaluation of Cannabinoid Oil for Dravet Syndrome: A Cost-Utility Analysis, Pharmacoeconomics, 2020; ():1179-2027",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,stiripentol + clobazam + valproate vs. cannabinoid oil + clobazam + valproate,seizures unresponsive to clobazam and valproate,5 Years,5 Years,"Female, Male",Full,13 Years,1.50,1.50,-9738.86,Canada,2019,-7429.73
23625,Economic Evaluation of Senshio R (Ospemifene) for the Treatment of Vulvovaginal Atrophy in Scotland,"BACKGROUND: Local oestrogens, the current treatment for vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), are not suitable for all women. Standard of care (SoC) consists of over-the-counter lubricants and moisturisers. Senshio R (ospemifene) provides a treatment option for postmenopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal oestrogen therapy who would otherwise have an unmet clinical need. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ospemifene, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, for the treatment of moderate to severe symptomatic VVA in postmenopausal women who are not candidates for local vaginal oestrogen therapy. METHODS: The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) recently evaluated the clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence of ospemifene plus SoC compared with SoC alone. A cost-effectiveness study, from a National Health Service (NHS) Scotland perspective over a lifetime time horizon, was submitted to the SMC. The cohort-based Markov model used robust clinical evidence from two large pivotal phase III randomised controlled studies and included four health states classified by dyspareunia symptom severity: none, mild, moderate and severe. The movement of women between health states was dependent on the effectiveness of treatment in reducing dyspareunia. Extensive sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess the level of confidence associated with the base-case results. RESULTS: Treatment with ospemifene was associated with an additional cost of 847 per patient and an increase in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of 0.06 per patient. Ospemifene had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 14,138 per QALY. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was a probability of 89% that ospemifene was cost-effective at a threshold of 20,000 per QALY gained. Ospemifene remained cost-effective under all scenario analyses. The SMC reviewed the clinical and economic evidence and judged that the evidence demonstrated a robust case to support prescribing ospemifene in NHS Scotland. CONCLUSION: Ospemifene is a cost-effective intervention that has recently been accepted by the SMC for the treatment of postmenopausal women with moderate to severe VVA who are not candidates for local oestrogen.",2020-01-33358,0,J.

23626,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a hybrid closed-loop system versus multiple daily injections and capillary glucose testing for adults with type 1 diabetes,"Background Hybrid closed-loop systems may offer improved HbA1c levels, more time-in-range, and less hypoglycaemia than alternative treatment strategies. However, it is unclear if glycaemic improvements offset this technology''s higher acquisition costs. Among adults with type 1 diabetes in Australia, we sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a hybrid closed-loop system in comparison to the current standard of care, comprising insulin injections and capillary glucose testing. Methods Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using decision analysis in combination with a Markov model to simulate disease progression in a cohort of adults with type 1 diabetes and compare the downstream health and economic consequences of hybrid closed-loop therapy versus current standard of care. Transition probabilities and utilities were sourced from published studies. Costs were considered from the perspective of the Australian healthcare system. A lifetime time horizon was considered, with annual discount rates of 5% applied to future costs and outcomes. Uncertainty was assessed with probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. Results Use of a hybrid closed-loop system resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AUD $37,767 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. This is below the traditionally cited willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained in the Australian setting. Sensitivity analyses that varied baseline glycaemic control, treatment effects, technology costs, age, discount rates, and time horizon indicated the results to be robust.

23627,Cost-effectiveness of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and watchful observation for incidental thyroid nodules,"OBJECTIVES: A trial-based comparison of the use of resources, costs and health utility outcomes of fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), and watchful observation for incidental small (< 2 cm) thyroid nodules was performed using data from the randomized controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: Using data from 314 patients, healthcare-related use of resources, costs, health utility, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated at 12 months after first presentation of incidental thyroid nodule(s) on an intention-to-treat basis with adjustment for covariates. Uncertainty about the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for FNAC versus watchful management at 12 months of follow-up was incorporated using bootstrapping. Multiple imputation methods were used to deal with missing data. RESULTS: FNAC management was associated with greater use of healthcare resources and mean direct healthcare costs per patient (US$542.47 vs US$411.55). Lower mean 12-month QALYs per patient in FNAC was observed in comparison to watchful observation (0.752 versus 0.758). The probability that FNAC management was cost-effective compared with watchful management at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US50,000 per QALY gained was 26.5%. CONCLUSION: Based on 12-month data from RCT, watchful observation appeared cost-saving compared to FNAC in patients with incidental thyroid nodules that have a low-suspicion sonographic pattern and measure between 1.0 and 2.0 cm from healthcare provider perspective.

23628,Pharmacological acromegaly treatment: cost-utility and value of information analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing drug strategies involving octreotide, lanreotide, pasireotide, and pegvisomant for the treatment of patients with acromegaly who have failed surgery, from a Brazilian public payer perspective. METHODS: A probabilistic cohort Markov model was developed. One-year cycles were employed. The patients started at 45 years of age and were followed lifelong. Costs, efficacy, and quality of life parameters were retrieved from the literature. A discount rate (5%) was applied to both costs and efficacy. The results were reported as costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated when applicable. Scenario analyses considered alternative dosages, discount rate, tax exemption, and continued use of treatment despite lack of response. Value of information (VOI) analysis was conducted to explore uncertainty and to estimate the costs to be spent in future research. RESULTS: Only lanreotide showed an ICER reasonable for having its use considered in clinical practice (R$ 112,138 / US$ 28,389 per QALY compared to no treatment). Scenario analyses corroborated the base-case result. VOI analysis showed that much uncertainty surrounds the parameters, and future clinical research should cost less than R$ 43,230,000 / US$ 10,944,304 per year. VOI also showed that almost all uncertainty that precludes an optimal strategy choice involves quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: With current information, the only strategy that can be considered cost-effective in Brazil is lanreotide treatment. No second-line treatment is recommended. Significant uncertainty of parameters impairs optimal decision-making, and this conclusion can be generalized to other countries. Future research should focus on acquiring utility data.

23631,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of colorectal cancer screening using colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test, and risk score","BACKGROUND AND AIM: A risk-stratification score may be useful for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, alongside screening colonoscopy (CS) and fecal immunochemical test (FIT). This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of population-based CRC screening strategies using CS, FIT, and the Japanese CRC screening score. METHODS: The effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost-effectiveness, and required number of CS procedures were evaluated for screening strategies with primary screening CS (strategy 1), FIT (strategy 2), and the risk score (strategy 3), using a simulation model analysis with two scenarios. In scenario 1, uptake rates for all tests were 60%. In scenario 2, uptake rates for FIT and a risk score were 40%, and those for screening CS and CS following a positive FIT or high risk score were 20% and 70%, respectively. RESULTS: In scenario 1, strategy 1 gained the highest QALYs and required the highest cost. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per QALY gained for strategy 1 against the others were lower than 5 000 000 JPY. Strategy 1 required more than twice as many CS procedures as the other strategies. In scenario 2, strategy 3 had the highest QALYs and lowest cost, and strategy 1 had the lowest QALYs and highest cost. CONCLUSIONS: Screening CS has the potential to be the most effective and cost-effective form of CRC screening, although it requires a large number of CS procedures. However, if non-invasive tests are preferred by recipients, other screening strategies, particularly those using the risk score, can be more effective and cost-effective.

23637,Cost-effectiveness analysis of voice rehabilitation for patients with laryngeal cancer: a randomized controlled study,"INTRODUCTION: Voice problems are common following radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer. Few studies exist covering the effect of voice rehabilitation, and no previous studies exist regarding the cost of said rehabilitation. This randomized controlled study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of voice rehabilitation after radiotherapy for patients with laryngeal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 66 patients with laryngeal cancer with follow-up data 12 months post-radiotherapy were included. Patients were randomized into receiving either voice rehabilitation (n = 32) or no voice rehabilitation (n = 34). The patient outcome was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The index range between 0 and 1, where 0 equals death and 1 represents perfect health. The QALYs were assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire QLQ-C30 mapped to EuroQoL 5 Dimension values. The cost of rehabilitation and other healthcare visits was derived from hospital systems. The patients reported the total amount of sick leave days during the first 12 months following radiotherapy. The cost-effectiveness of the voice rehabilitation was compared with no rehabilitation intervention based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The cost per gained QALY with voice rehabilitation compared to no rehabilitation from a societal perspective was - 27,594 (SEK - 250,852) which indicates that the voice rehabilitation is a cost-saving alternative compared to no rehabilitation due to lower costs and a slightly better health outcome. From a healthcare perspective, the voice rehabilitation indicates a cost 60,800 (SEK 552,725) per gained QALY. CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, i.e., including the costs of production loss, voice rehabilitation compared to no voice rehabilitation following radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer seems to be cost-saving. When analyzing only the healthcare costs in relation to health outcomes, voice rehabilitation indicates an incremental cost of 60,800 per gained QALY, which is just above the threshold of the maximum willingness to pay level.",2020-01-33377,0,Gen.

23638,Cost-effectiveness analysis of voice rehabilitation for patients with laryngeal cancer: a randomized controlled study,"INTRODUCTION: Voice problems are common following radiotherapy for laryngeal cancer. Few studies exist covering the effect of voice rehabilitation, and no previous studies exist regarding the cost of said rehabilitation. This randomized controlled study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of voice rehabilitation after radiotherapy for patients with laryngeal cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 66 patients with laryngeal cancer with follow-up data 12 months post-radiotherapy were included. Patients were randomized into receiving either voice rehabilitation (n = 32) or no voice rehabilitation (n = 34). The patient outcome was measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The index range between 0 and 1, where 0 equals death and 1 represents perfect health. The QALYs were assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire QLQ-C30 mapped to EuroQoL 5 Dimension values. The cost of rehabilitation and other healthcare visits was derived from hospital systems. The patients reported the total amount of sick leave days during the first 12 months following radiotherapy. The cost-effectiveness of the voice rehabilitation was compared with no rehabilitation intervention based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: The cost per gained QALY with voice rehabilitation compared to no rehabilitation from a societal perspective was - 27,594 (SEK - 250,852) which indicates that the voice rehabilitation is a cost-saving alternative compared to no rehabilitation due to lower costs and a slightly better health outcome.

23639,Cost-Effectiveness Model Shows Superiority of Wireless Spinal Cord Stimulation Implantation Without a Separate Trial,"OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of wireless spinal cord stimulation (Wireless SCS) with single stage ""direct to permanent"" implantation vs. screening with temporary electrodes and an external pulse generator followed by implantation of a system for long-term use (IPG SCS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a cost model that takes a 2019 United States (U.S.) payer perspective and is based on IPG SCS cost models for subjects with chronic back and/or leg pain. Our six-month decision tree includes the screening trial period (success >=50% relief) and leads to various levels of pain relief with or without complications for IPG SCS and Wireless SCS and without complications for conventional medical management (CMM). Every three months in the follow-on 15-year Markov model (with costs and quality-adjusted life years discounted 3.5% annually), subjects remain stable or transition to deteriorated health or death. Subjects who fail SCS receive CMM. After 60 Markov cycles, a 100,000-sample simulation reveals the impact of maximum willingness-to-pay (WTP) from $10,000 to $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year on net monetary benefit (NMB). Sensitivity analyses considered the impact of the Wireless SCS screening success rate, Wireless SCS device cost, and IPG SCS device longevity. RESULTS: Compared with IPG SCS, Wireless SCS offers higher clinical effectiveness at a lower cost and a higher NMB for our WTP thresholds and is, thus, dominant. Wireless SCS is also cost-effective compared with CMM. Results remain robust with 1) Wireless SCS screening success rates as low as 85% (dominant), 2) the cost of the Wireless SCS devices as high as $55,000 (cost-effective), and 3) IPG SCS devices lasting 12 years (dominant).

23642,Comparison of Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound as Diagnostic Options for Unclear Cystic Renal Lesions: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"PURPOSE: Correct differentiation between malignant and benign incidentally found cystic renal lesions has critical implications for patient management. In several studies contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) showed higher sensitivity with respect to the accurate characterization of these lesions compared to MRI, but the cost-effectiveness of CEUS has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CEUS as an alternative imaging method to MRI for the characterization of incidentally found cystic renal lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model including the diagnostic modalities MRI and CEUS was created based on Markov simulations estimating lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The recent literature was reviewed to obtain model input parameters. The deterministic sensitivity of diagnostic parameters and costs was determined and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte-Carlo Modelling was applied. Willingness-to-pay (WTP) was assumed to be $ 100 000/QALY. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, the total costs for CEUS were $9654.43, whereas the total costs for MRI were $9675.03. CEUS resulted in an expected effectiveness of 8.06 QALYs versus 8.06 QALYs for MRI. Therefore, from an economic point of view, CEUS was identified as an adequate diagnostic alternative to MRI. Sensitivity analysis showed that results may vary if CEUS costs increase or those of MRI decrease. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the analysis, the use of CEUS was identified as a cost-effective diagnostic strategy for the characterization of incidentally found cystic renal lesions.

23643,A Corticosteroid-Eluting Sinus Implant Following Endoscopic Sinus Surgery for Chronic Rhinosinusitis: A UK-Based Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is one of the commonest chronic health problems among adults in the UK. Around 15% of CRS patients undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) annually after failing medical treatment. However, as incomplete resolution of symptoms or complications post-operatively is common, the post-operative management is considered to be as important as the surgery itself. A bioabsorbable corticosteroid-eluting sinus implant (CESI) (Propel R, mometasone furoate 370 micro g) has been used as an alternative post-FESS treatment. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of the corticosteroid-eluting implant versus non-corticosteroid-eluting spacer following FESS for treatment of patients with CRS. METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to estimate the cost and effectiveness in each strategy. Costs and effects were estimated from a UK National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services perspective over a 6-month time horizon. Model pathways and parameters were informed by existing clinical guidelines and literature and sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore uncertainties in base-case assumptions. RESULTS: Over a 6-month time horizon, inserting CESI at the end of FESS is less costly (4646 vs. 4655 per patient) and is the more effective intervention [total quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over 6 months 0.443 vs. 0.444] than non-corticosteroid-eluting spacers; hence, it is a dominant strategy. The probabilistic analysis results indicate that CESI following FESS has a 62% probability of being cost effective at the 20,000/per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold and 56% probability of being a cost-saving intervention. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CESI after FESS results in fewer post-operative complications than non-corticosteroid-eluting implants and may be a cost-saving technology over a 6-month time horizon. Although the cost of initial treatment with the CESI is greater, cost savings are made due to a reduction in the number of complications experienced.",2020-01-33383,0,Health Res.

23644,Estimated cost-effectiveness and burden of disease associated with quadrivalent cell-based and egg-based influenza vaccines in Spain,"Influenza is a viral respiratory disease that causes significant clinical and economic burden globally. Quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) is frequently used to protect people who have a high-risk of developing influenza complications due to comorbidities. QIV offers protection against influenza A (A/H1N1 and H3N2) and B (B/Victoria, and B/Yamagata) strains. The European Medicines Agency has recently approved a cell-based QIV (QIVc) in people aged over 9 years old. QIVc has been shown to be more effective at preventing influenza than traditional egg-based QIV (QIVe). In this study, we use a health economic model adapted to Spain to assess the costs and outcomes associated with using QIVc instead of QIVe in people aged 9-64 at high-risk of complications. Observed vaccine coverage of 32% in the 9-17 age group, 17% in those aged 18-59, and 22% for ages 60-64 was used in the analysis. In total, 2.5 million people were vaccinated in the simulations. Using QIVc instead of QIVe was associated with 16,221fewer symptomatic cases, 4,522 fewer primary care visits, 1,015 fewer emergency room visits and 88 fewer hospitalizations. From a societal perspective, QIVc was more effective and less expensive compared to QIVe, leading to a cost-saving of 3.4 million. From a public payer perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for QIVc vs QIVe was 12,852 per QALY gained. In conclusion, QIVc offers a cost-effective alternative to QIVe and should be considered as an alternative vaccine to QIVe for people aged 9-64 at high-risk of influenza complications in Spain.",2020-01-33384,0,Int.

23650,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a sequential pneumococcal vaccination compared to single-dose vaccination strategy for adults in Hong Kong,"Two vaccines, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13), are widely available for the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults. However, it is unclear how cost-effective these pneumococcal vaccine choices are in the Hong Kong healthcare environment. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a sequential administration of PCV13 followed by PPSV23 compared to a single dose of PPSV23 vaccination for pneumococcal disease control in Hong Kong adults aged >=65 years and individuals aged 20-64 years with immunocompromising and chronic conditions. A previously developed deterministic cohort sequential model was applied to compare the outcomes of two vaccination strategies from a societal perspective. Population-specific model input, including incidence, mortality, case-fatality, risk group distribution, vaccination costs, disease management, and productivity loss, was estimated from a Hong Kong-wide electronic medical database. Costs were valued in US$ in 2017. Vaccination strategies with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER, defined as incremental cost per QALY saved) less than one local GDP per capita ($46,193 in 2017) were defined as highly cost-effective. Deterministic sensitivity analyses (SA) were conducted. Compared with single-dose PPSV23, sequential vaccination of PCV13 followed by PPSV23 was cost-saving for adults aged >=20 years. In the deterministic SA, the base-case results were robust for tested parameter uncertainties.

23651,Cost-utility of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest,"BACKGROUND: The use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in cardiogenic shock keeps increasing, but its cost-utility is unknown. METHODS: We studied retrospectively the cost-utility of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a five-year cohort of consequent patients treated due to refractory cardiogenic shock or cardiac arrest in a transplant centre in 2013-2017. In our centre, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is considered for all cardiogenic shock patients potentially eligible for heart transplantation, and for selected postcardiotomy patients. We assessed the costs of the index hospitalization and of the one-year hospital costs, and the patients'' health-related quality of life (response rate 71.7%). Based on the data and the population-based life expectancies, we calculated the amount and the costs of quality-adjusted life years gained both without discount and with an annual discount of 3.5%. RESULTS: The cohort included 102 patients (78 cardiogenic shock; 24 cardiac arrest) of whom 67 (65.7%) survived to discharge and 66 (64.7%) to one year. The effective costs per one hospital survivor were 242,303. Median in-hospital costs of the index hospitalization per patient were 129,967 (interquartile range 150,340). Mean predicted number of quality-adjusted life years gained by the treatment was 20.9 (standard deviation 9.7) without discount, and the median cost per quality-adjusted life year was 7474 (interquartile range 10,973). With the annual discount of 3.5%, 13.0 (standard deviation 4.8) quality-adjusted life years were gained with the cost of 12,642 per quality-adjusted life year (interquartile range 15,059).

23652,Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment sequences containing tofacitinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib-containing treatment sequences versus sequences containing only standard biological therapies in patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) after the failure of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARD-IR population) and in patients previously treated with methotrexate (MTX) who show an inadequate response to second-line therapy with any tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi-IR population). METHODS: A patient-level microsimulation model estimated, from the perspective of the Spanish Public NHS, lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for treatment sequences starting with tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) followed by biological therapies versus sequences of biological treatments only. Concomitant treatment with MTX was considered. Model''s parameters comprised demographic and clinical inputs (initial Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] score and clinical response to short- and long-term treatment). Efficacy was measured by means of HAQ score changes using mixed treatment comparisons and data from long-term extension (LTE) trials. Serious adverse events (SAEs) data were derived from the literature. Total cost estimation (, 2018) included drug acquisition, parenteral administration, disease progression and SAE management. RESULTS: In the csDMARD-IR population, sequences starting with tofacitinib proved dominant options (more QALYs and lower costs) versus the corresponding sequences without tofacitinib. In the TNFi-IR population, first-line treatment with tofacitinib+MTX followed by scAbatacept+MTXrituximab+MTXcertolizumab+MTX proved dominant versus scTocilizumab+MTXscAbatacept+MTXrituximab+MTXcertolizumab+MTX; and tofacitinib+MTXscTocilizumab+MTXscAbatacept+MTXrituximab+MTX versus scTocilizumab+MTXscAbatacept+MTXrituximab+MTXcertolizumab+MTX was less effective but remained a cost-saving option. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of tofacitinib seems a dominant strategy in moderate-to-severe RA patients after csDMARDs failure.

23656,Impact on perinatal health and cost-effectiveness of risk-based care in obstetrics: a before-after study,"BACKGROUND: Obstetric health care relies on an adequate antepartum risk selection. Most guidelines used for risk stratification, however, do not assess absolute risks. In 2017, a prediction tool was implemented in a Dutch region. This tool combines first trimester prediction models with obstetric care paths tailored to the individual risk profile, enabling risk-based care. OBJECTIVE: To assess impact and cost-effectiveness of risk-based care compared to care-as-usual in a general population. METHODS: A before-after study was conducted using 2 multicenter prospective cohorts. The first cohort (2013-2015) received care-as-usual; the second cohort (2017-2018) received risk-based care. Health outcomes were (1) a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes and (2) maternal quality-adjusted life-years. Costs were estimated using a health care perspective from conception to 6 weeks after the due date. Mean costs per woman, cost differences between the 2 groups, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: In total 3425 women were included. In nulliparous women there was a significant reduction of perinatal adverse outcomes among the risk-based care group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.94), but not in multiparous women. Mean costs per pregnant woman were significantly lower for risk-based care (mean difference, -2766; 95% confidence interval, -3700 to -1825). No differences in maternal quality of life, adjusted for baseline health, were observed. CONCLUSION: In the Netherlands, risk-based care in nulliparous women was associated with improved perinatal outcomes as compared to care-as-usual.

In nulliparous women there was a significant reduction of perinatal adverse outcomes among the risk-based care group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.94), but not in multiparous women. Mean costs per pregnant woman were significantly lower for risk-based care (mean difference, -2766; 95% confidence interval, -3700 to -1825). No differences in maternal quality of life, adjusted for baseline health, were observed. CONCLUSION: In the Netherlands, risk-based care in nulliparous women was associated with improved perinatal outcomes as compared to care-as-usual. Furthermore, risk-based care was cost-effective compared to care-as-usual and resulted in lower health care costs. Copyright © 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

23662,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Supervised Exercise Training in Men with Prostate Cancer Previously Treated with Radiation Therapy and Androgen-Deprivation Therapy,"BACKGROUND: Exercise for prostate cancer (PCa) survivors has been shown to be effective in addressing metabolic function and associated co-morbidities, as well as sarcopenia and significant functional impairment resulting from long-term androgen deprivation. Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of exercise interventions for PCa, however, is lacking, thus the aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a supervised exercise intervention for long-term PCa survivors who previously received radiation therapy and androgen-deprivation therapy. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis from an Australian healthcare-payer perspective was conducted using patient-level data from a multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) of supervised exercise training (resistance and aerobic) compared to receiving printed exercise material and a recommendation to exercise in long-term PCa survivors (> 5 years post-diagnosis). Analysis was undertaken for the 6-month supervised exercise portion of the intervention, which involved 100 men aged between 62 and 85 years, 50 in each arm. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: A 6-month supervised exercise intervention for PCa survivors resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of AU$64,235 (2018 AUD) at an incremental cost of AU$546 per person and a QALY gain of 0.0085. At a willingness-to-pay of AU$50,000, the probability that the intervention is cost-effective was 41%. Sensitivity analysis showed that maintenance of benefits via a 6-month home-based intervention, immediately following the supervised intervention, lowered the cost per QALY gained to AU$32,051. DISCUSSION: This is the first cost-effectiveness analysis of exercise for PCa survivors. The intervention was effective, but unlikely to be cost-effective at the generally accepted willingness-to-pay of AU$50,000 per QALY. It is likely that evidence to support cost savings from post-intervention outcomes would reveal greater benefits and contribute to a more comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis. Future RCTs should incorporate longer follow-up durations and collection of data to support modelling to capture future health benefits. Measures of quality of life or utility more sensitive to the impact of physical activity would also improve future economic evaluations.",2020-01-33396,0,J. Int.

23663,Cost-effectiveness analysis of fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are at risk for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (RCDI). We aimed to evaluate the potential health economic and clinical outcomes of four strategies for management of RCDI in IBD patients from the perspective of public health-care provider in Hong Kong. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was designed to simulate outcomes of adult IBD patients with first RCDI treated with vancomycin, vancomycin plus bezlotoxumab, fidaxomicin and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Model inputs were derived from literature and public data. Primary model outcomes were C. difficile infection (CDI)-related direct medical cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) loss. Base-case and sensitivity analysis were performed. RESULTS: Comparing to vancomycin, fidaxomicin and vancomycin plus bezlotoxumab, FMT saved 0.00318, 0.00149 and 0.00306 QALYs and reduced cost by USD3180, USD3790 and USD5514, respectively, in base-case analysis. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, FMT was cost-saving when comparing to vancomycin, fidaxomicin and vancomycin plus bezlotoxumab by USD3765 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3732-3798; P < 0.001), USD3854 (95%CI 3827-3883; P < 0.001) and USD6501 (95%CI 6465-6,536; P < 0.001), respectively. The QALYs saved by FMT (vs vancomycin) were 0.00386 QALYs (95%CI 0.00384-0.00388; P < 0.001), (vs fidaxomicin) 0.00179 QALYs (95%CI 0.00177-0.00180; P < 0.001) and (vs vancomycin plus bezlotoxumab) 0.00376 QALYs (95%CI 0.00374-0.00378; P < 0.001). FMT was found to save QALYs at lower cost in 99.3% (vs vancomycin), 99.7% (vs fidaxomicin) and 100.0% (vs vancomycin plus bezlotoxumab) of the 10 000 Monte Carlo simulations. CONCLUSIONS: FMT for IBD patients with RCDI appeared to save both direct medical cost and QALYs when comparing to vancomycin (with or without bezlotoxumab) and fidaxomicin.

23664,Economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the management of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) in Hong Kong. METHODS: A within trial cost-utility analysis with the primary endpoint for the economic evaluation being the Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) and associated Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) over 14 weeks of treatment. A secondary cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken with the endpoint being change in pain as measured on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were randomised to acupuncture or usual care. Acupuncture resulted in significant improvements in pain intensity (8- and 14-week mean changes compared to usual care of -1.8 and -1.8, respectively), pain interference (8- and 14-week mean changes compared to usual care of -1.5 and -0.9, respectively) and indicators of quality of life and neurotoxicity-related symptoms. However, in the economic evaluation there was little difference in QALYs between the two arms (mean change 0.209 and 0.200 in the acupuncture and usual care arms, respectively). Also, costs yielded deterministic ICERs of HK$616,965.62, HK$824,083.44 and HK$540,727.56 per QALY gained from the health care provider perspective, the societal perspective and the patient perspective, respectively. These costs are significantly higher than the cost-effectiveness threshold of HK$180,450 that was used for the base case analysis. CONCLUSION: While acupuncture can improve symptoms and quality of life indicators related to CIPN, it is unlikely to be a cost-effective treatment for CIPN-related pain in health care systems with limited resources.

23667,An Outreach Rehabilitation Program for Nursing Home Residents after Hip Fracture may be Cost-Saving,"BACKGROUND: We compared the cost-effectiveness of 10 weeks of outreach rehabilitation (intervention) versus usual care (control) for ambulatory nursing home residents after hip fracture. METHODS: Enrollment occurred February 2011 through June 2015 in a Canadian metropolitan region. 77 participants were allocated in a 2:1 ratio to receive a 10-week rehabilitation program (intervention) or usual care (control) (46 intervention; 31 control). Using a payer perspective, we performed main and sensitivity analyses. Health outcome was measured by quality-adjusted life years(QALYs), using the EQ5D, completed at study entry, 3-, 6-, and 12-months. We obtained patient-specific data for outpatient visits, physician claims, and inpatient re-admissions; the trial provided rehabilitation utilization/cost data. We estimated incremental cost and incremental effectiveness. RESULTS: Groups were similar at study entry; the mean age was 87.9+/-6.6 years, 54(71%) were female and 58(75%) had severe cognitive impairment. EQ5D QALYs scores were non-significantly higher for intervention participants. Inpatient re-admissions were two times higher among controls, with a cost difference of -$3350/patient for intervention participants, offsetting the cost/intervention participant of $2300 for the outreach rehabilitation. The adjusted incremental QALYs/patient difference was 0.024 favouring the intervention, with an incremental cost/patient of -$621 for intervention participants; these values were not statistically significant. A sensitivity analysis reinforced these findings, suggesting that the intervention was likely dominant. CONCLUSION: A 10-week outreach rehabilitation intervention for nursing home residents who sustain a hip fracture may be cost-saving, through reduced post-fracture hospital re-admissions. These results support further work to evaluate post-fracture rehabilitation for nursing home residents. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

23668,A Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation of Surgical Approaches to Proctectomy,"BACKGROUND: Robotic surgery is increasingly used for proctectomy, but the cost-effectiveness of this approach is uncertain. Robotic surgery is considered more expensive than open or laparoscopic approaches, but in certain situations has been demonstrated to be cost-effective. We examined the cost-effectiveness of open, laparoscopic, and robotic approaches to proctectomy from societal and healthcare system perspectives. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate one-year costs and outcomes of robotic, laparoscopic, and open proctectomy based on data from the available literature. The robustness of our results was tested with one-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Open proctectomy had increased cost and lower quality of life (QOL) compared with laparoscopy and robotic approaches. In the societal perspective, robotic proctectomy costs $497/case more than laparoscopy, with minimal QOL improvements, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $751,056 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In the healthcare sector perspective, robotic proctectomy resulted in $983/case more and an ICER of $1,485,139/QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses demonstrated factors influencing cost-effectiveness primarily pertained to the operative cost and the postoperative length of stay (LOS). In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the cost-effective approach to proctectomy was laparoscopic in 42% of cases, robotic in 39%, and open in 19% at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic and robotic proctectomy cost less and have higher QALY than the open approach. Based on current data, laparoscopy is the most cost-effective approach.

23672,Cost-effectiveness of biennial screening for diabetes related retinopathy in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared to annual screening,"OBJECTIVE: Examine the health and economic impact of extending screening intervals in people with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) without diabetes-related retinopathy (DR). SETTING: Diabetic Eye Screening Wales (DESW). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study with cost-utility analysis (CUA) and Decremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (DCER) study. INTERVENTION: Biennial screening versus usual care (annual screening). INPUTS: Anonymised data from DESW were linked to primary care data for people with two prior screening events with no DR. Transition probabilities for progression to DR were estimated based on a subset of 26,812 and 1232 people with T2DM and T1DM, respectively. DCER above 20,000 per QALY was considered cost-effective. RESULTS: The base case analysis DCER results of 71,243 and 23,446 per QALY for T2DM and T1DM respectively at a 3.5% discount rate and 56,822 and 14,221 respectively when discounted at 1.5%. Diabetes management represented by the mean HbA1c was 7.5% for those with T2DM and 8.7% for T1DM. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Extending screening to biennial based on HbA1c, being the strongest predictor of progression of DR, at three levels of HbA1c 6.5%, 8.0% and 9.5% lost one QALY saving the NHS 106,075; 58,653 and 31,626 respectively for T2DM and 94,696, 37,646 and 11,089 respectively for T1DM. In addition, extending screening to biennial based on the duration of diabetes > 6 years for T2DM per QALY lost, saving the NHS 54,106 and for 6-12 and > 12 years for T1DM saving 83,856, 23,446 and 13,340 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Base case and sensitivity analyses indicate biennial screening to be cost-effective for T2DM irrespective of HbA1c and duration of diabetes.

23673,Cost-effectiveness of biennial screening for diabetes related retinopathy in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared to annual screening,"OBJECTIVE: Examine the health and economic impact of extending screening intervals in people with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) without diabetes-related retinopathy (DR). SETTING: Diabetic Eye Screening Wales (DESW). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study with cost-utility analysis (CUA) and Decremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (DCER) study. INTERVENTION: Biennial screening versus usual care (annual screening). INPUTS: Anonymised data from DESW were linked to primary care data for people with two prior screening events with no DR. Transition probabilities for progression to DR were estimated based on a subset of 26,812 and 1232 people with T2DM and T1DM, respectively. DCER above 20,000 per QALY was considered cost-effective. RESULTS: The base case analysis DCER results of 71,243 and 23,446 per QALY for T2DM and T1DM respectively at a 3.5% discount rate and 56,822 and 14,221 respectively when discounted at 1.5%. Diabetes management represented by the mean HbA1c was 7.5% for those with T2DM and 8.7% for T1DM. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Extending screening to biennial based on HbA1c, being the strongest predictor of progression of DR, at three levels of HbA1c 6.5%, 8.0% and 9.5% lost one QALY saving the NHS 106,075; 58,653 and 31,626 respectively for T2DM and 94,696, 37,646 and 11,089 respectively for T1DM. In addition, extending screening to biennial based on the duration of diabetes > 6 years for T2DM per QALY lost, saving the NHS 54,106 and for 6-12 and > 12 years for T1DM saving 83,856, 23,446 and 13,340 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Base case and sensitivity analyses indicate biennial screening to be cost-effective for T2DM irrespective of HbA1c and duration of diabetes. However, the uncertainty around the DCER indicates that annual screening should be maintained for those with T1DM especially when the HbA1c exceeds 80 mmol/mol (9.5%) and duration of diabetes is greater than 12 years.",2020-01-33404,0,Int.

23674,Total Thyroidectomy Versus Lobectomy in Small Nodules Suspicious for Papillary Thyroid Cancer: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Recent American Thyroid Association Guidelines recommend either near-total/total thyroidectomy or lobectomy for patients with a thyroid nodule suspicious for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy (Bethesda V). In this analysis, we aim to assess the cost-effectiveness of lobectomy in comparison to total thyroidectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: A Markov model cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for a base case followed for 20 years postoperatively. Cost and probabilities data were retrieved from the current literature. Effectiveness was represented by quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Total thyroidectomy protocol produced an incremental cost of $2,681.36 and incremental effectiveness of -0.24 QALY as compared to lobectomy protocol (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = -$11,188.85/QALY). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that total thyroidectomy becomes a cost-effective strategy only if the risk of stages III and IV PTC is 82.4% among patients with suspicious PTC on preoperative FNA. Lobectomy is cost effective and preferred over total thyroidectomy as long as lobectomy complications are less than 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Total thyroidectomy is not just cost prohibitive but also associated with a lower effectiveness compared to lobectomy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 2c Laryngoscope, 2020.

23675,Impact of preventive screening and lifestyle interventions in women with a history of preeclampsia: A micro-simulation study,"BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a female-specific risk factor for the development of future cardiovascular disease. Whether early preventive cardiovascular disease risk screenings combined with risk-based lifestyle interventions in women with previous preeclampsia are beneficial and cost-effective is unknown. METHODS: A micro-simulation model was developed to assess the life-long impact of preventive cardiovascular screening strategies initiated after women experienced preeclampsia during pregnancy. Screening was started at the age of 30 or 40 years and repeated every five years. Data (initial and follow-up) from women with a history of preeclampsia was used to calculate 10-year cardiovascular disease risk estimates according to Framingham Risk Score. An absolute risk threshold of 2% was evaluated for treatment selection, i.e. lifestyle interventions (e.g. increasing physical activity). Screening benefits were assessed in terms of costs and quality-adjusted-life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared with no screening. RESULTS: Expected health outcomes for no screening are 27.35 quality-adjusted-life-years and increase to 27.43 quality-adjusted-life-years (screening at 30 years with 2% threshold). The expected costs for no screening are 9426 and around 13,881 for screening at 30 years (for a 2% threshold). Preventive screening at 40 years with a 2% threshold has the most favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, i.e. 34,996/quality-adjusted-life-year, compared with other screening scenarios and no screening. CONCLUSIONS: Early cardiovascular disease risk screening followed by risk-based lifestyle interventions may lead to small long-term health benefits in women with a history of preeclampsia. However, the cost-effectiveness of a lifelong cardiovascular prevention programme starting early after preeclampsia with risk-based lifestyle advice alone is relatively unfavourable.

23681,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Screening Extremely Low Birthweight Children for Hepatoblastoma Using Serum Alpha-fetoprotein,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening children born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW) for hepatoblastoma using serial serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) measurements. STUDY DESIGN: We created a decision tree to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening children born at ELBW between 3 months and 48 months of age compared with current standard of care (no screening). Our model used discounted lifetime costs and monetary benefits in 2018 U.S. dollars (USD), based on estimates in the published literature. The effects of uncertainty in model parameters were also assessed using univariate sensitivity analyses, in which we changed the values for one parameter at a time to assess the effect on the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: For the estimated 55,699 children born at ELBW in the United States each year, this screening is associated with 77.7 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a cost of $8.7 million. This results in an ICER of about $112,000/QALY, which is considered cost-effective from a U.S. Societal perspective. For children diagnosed with hepatoblastoma, our model finds that the screening regimen is associated with 10.1% increase in survival, a 4.18 increase in expected QALYs, and a $245,184 decrease in expected cost. CONCLUSIONS: Screening ELBW children for hepatoblastoma between 3 months and 48 months of age dominates the alternative and is cost-effective from a societal perspective.

We aimed to determine the health outcomes and cost implications of achieving TICI 2b vs TICI 3 reperfusion in acute stroke patients with LVO. METHODS: A decision-analytic study was performed with Markov modeling to estimate the lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALY) of EVT-treated patients, and costs based on the degree of reperfusion achieved. The study was performed with a societal perspective in the United States'' setting. The base case calculations were performed in three age groups: 55-, 65-, and 75-year-old patients. RESULTS: Within 90 days, achieving TICI 3 resulted in a cost saving of $3676 per patient and health benefit of 11 days in perfect health as compared with TICI 2b. In the long term, for the three age groups, achieving TICI 3 resulted in cost savings of $46,498, $25,832, and $15 719 respectively, and health benefits of 2.14 QALYs, 1.71 QALYs, and 1.23 QALYs. Every 1% increase in TICI 3 in 55-year-old patients nationwide resulted in a cost saving of $3.4 million and a health benefit of 156 QALYs. Among 65-year-old patients, the corresponding cost savings and health benefit were $1.9 million and 125 QALYs. CONCLUSION: There are substantial cost and health implications in achieving complete vs incomplete reperfusion after EVT. Our study provides a framework to assess the cost-benefit analysis of emerging diagnostic and therapeutic techniques that might improve patient selection, and increase the chances of achieving complete reperfusion.

In the long term, for the three age groups, achieving TICI 3 resulted in cost savings of $46,498, $25,832, and $15 719 respectively, and health benefits of 2.14 QALYs, 1.71 QALYs, and 1.23 QALYs. Every 1% increase in TICI 3 in 55-year-old patients nationwide resulted in a cost saving of $3.4 million and a health benefit of 156 QALYs. Among 65-year-old patients, the corresponding cost savings and health benefit were $1.9 million and 125 QALYs. CONCLUSION: There are substantial cost and health implications in achieving complete vs incomplete reperfusion after EVT. Our study provides a framework to assess the cost-benefit analysis of emerging diagnostic and therapeutic techniques that might improve patient selection, and increase the chances of achieving complete reperfusion.

23686,Cardiac Resynchronisation Therapy in Patients with Moderate to Severe Heart Failure in Germany: A Cost-Utility Analysis of the Additional Defibrillator,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) is a well-established form of treatment for patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony. There are two different types of CRT devices: the biventricular pacemaker (CRT-P) and the biventricular defibrillator (CRT-D). The latter is more complex but also more expensive. For the majority of patients who are eligible for CRT, both devices are appropriate according to current guidelines. The purpose of this study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis for CRT-D compared to CRT-P from a German payer''s perspective. METHODS: A cohort Markov-model was developed to assess average costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for CRT-D and CRT-P. The model consisted of six stages: one for the device implementation, one for the absorbing state death, and two stages (""Stable"" and ""Hospital"") for either a CRT device or medical therapy. The time horizon was 20 years. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CRT-D compared with CRT-P was 24,659 per additional QALY gained. In deterministic sensitivity analysis, the survival advantage of CRT-D to CRT-P was the most influential input parameter. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis 96% of the simulated cases were more effective but also more costly. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with CRT-D compared to CRT-P resulted in an additional gain of QALYs, but was more expensive. In addition, the ICER was subject to uncertainty, especially due to the uncertainty in the survival benefit.

23688,The Cost-Effectiveness of Platelet-Rich Plasma Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Markov Decision Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Use of platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) injections for treating knee osteoarthritis has increased over the past decade. We used cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the value of PRP in delaying the need for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: We developed a Markov model to analyze the baseline case: a 55-year-old patient with Kellgren-Lawrence grade-II or III knee osteoarthritis undergoing a series of 3 PRP injections with a 1-year delay to TKA versus a TKA from the outset. Both health-care payer and societal perspectives were included. Transition probabilities were derived from systematic review of 72 studies, quality-of-life (QOL) values from the Tufts University Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry, and individual costs from Medicare reimbursement schedules. Primary outcome measures were total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), organized into incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and evaluated against willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000. One and 2-way sensitivity analyses were performed as well as a probabilistic analysis varying PRP-injection cost, TKA delay intervals, and TKA outcomes over 10,000 different simulations. RESULTS: From a health-care payer perspective, PRP resulted in 14.55 QALYs compared with 14.63 for TKA from the outset, with total health-care costs of $26,619 and $26,235, respectively. TKA from the outset produced a higher number of QALYs at a lower cost, so it dominated. From a societal perspective, PRP cost $49,090 versus $49,424 for TKA from the outset. The ICER for TKA from the outset was $4,175 per QALY, below the $50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Assuming the $728 published cost of a PRP injection, no delay time that was <10 years produced a cost-effective course. When the QOL value was increased from the published value of 0.788 to >0.89, PRP therapy was cost-effective with even a 1-year delay to TKA. CONCLUSIONS: When considering direct and unpaid indirect costs, PRP injections are not cost-effective. The primary factor preventing PRP from being cost-effective is not the price per injection but rather a lack of established clinical efficacy in relieving pain and improving function and in delaying TKA. PRP may have value for higher-risk patients with high perioperative complication rates, higher TKA revision rates, or poorer postoperative outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic Level IV.

23690,Cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment of adult spinal deformity: comparison of posterior-only versus anteroposterior approach,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Considerable debate exists regarding the optimal surgical approach for adult spinal deformity (ASD). It remains unclear which approach, posterior-only or combined anterior-posterior (AP), is more cost-effective. Our goal is to determine the 2-year cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for each approach. PURPOSE: To compare the 2-year cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment for ASD between the posterior-only approach and combined AP approach. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective economic analysis of a prospective, multicenter database PATIENT SAMPLE: From a prospective, multicenter surgical database of ASD, patients undergoing five or more level fusions through a posterior-only or AP approach were identified and compared. METHODS: QALYs gained were determined using baseline, 1-year, and 2-year postoperative Short Form 6D. Cost was calculated from actual, direct hospital costs including any subsequent readmission or revision. Cost-effectiveness was determined using cost/QALY gained. RESULTS: The AP approach showed significantly higher index cost than the posterior-only approach ($84,329 vs. $64,281). This margin decreased at 2-year follow-up with total costs of $89,824 and $73,904, respectively. QALYs gained at 2 years were similar with 0.21 and 0.17 in the posterior-only and the AP approaches, respectively. The cost/QALY at 2 years after surgery was significantly higher in the AP approach ($525,080) than in the posterior-only approach ($351,086). CONCLUSIONS: We assessed 2-year cost-effectiveness for the surgical treatment through posterior-only and AP approaches. The posterior-only approach is less expensive both for the index surgery and at 2-year follow-up. The QALY gained at 2-years was similar between the two approaches. Thus, posterior-only approach was more cost-effective than the AP approach under our study parameters. However, both approaches were not cost-effective at 2-year follow-up.

23691,Rivaroxaban plus aspirin for the prevention of ischaemic events in patients with cardiovascular disease: a cost-effectiveness study,"BACKGROUND: Dual pathway inhibition with 2.5 mg rivaroxaban twice daily plus 100 mg aspirin once daily may be a promising alternative to 100 mg aspirin antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease and/or peripheral arterial disease. However, treatment costs and bleeding risks are higher, and there is another treatment option for peripheral arterial disease, 75 mg clopidogrel. A comprehensive assessment of benefits, risks and costs of dual pathway inhibition versus standard of care is needed. METHODS: We used a state transition model including cardiovascular, ischaemic limb and bleeding events to compare dual pathway inhibition to aspirin antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery disease, and additionally to clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy in peripheral arterial disease patients. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from costs and quality-adjusted life-years of lifelong treatment, and the cost-effectiveness probability at a 50,000/quality-adjusted life-year threshold. RESULTS: Quality-adjusted life-years and costs of dual pathway inhibition were highest, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios versus aspirin were 32,109 in coronary artery disease and 26,381 in peripheral arterial disease patients, with 92% and 56% cost-effectiveness probability, respectively (clopidogrel was extendedly dominated). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were below 20,000 in comorbid peripheral arterial disease patients and coronary artery disease patients younger than 65 years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were above 50,000 in carotid artery disease patients and coronary artery disease patients older than 75 years. CONCLUSION: Lifelong preventive treatment of coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease patients at risk of cardiovascular events with dual pathway inhibition improves health outcomes and seems overall cost-effective relative to aspirin antiplatelet therapy and also to clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy for peripheral arterial disease, particularly in comorbid patients, but not in older patients and in carotid artery disease patients.

23694,Cost-Effectiveness of First-Line Ibrutinib versus Third-Line in Patients with Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,"The ALLIANCE trial found that continuously administered ibrutinib in the first-line setting significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared to a fixed-duration treatment of rituximab and bendamustine in older adults with CLL. In this study, we created a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of ibrutinib in the first-line setting, compared to a strategy of using ibrutinib in the third-line after failure of time-limited bendamustine and venetoclax-based regimens. We estimated transition probabilities from randomized trials using parametric survival modeling. Lifetime direct healthcare costs, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated from a US payer perspective. First-line ibrutinib was associated with an improvement of 0.26 QALYs and 0.40 life-years compared to using ibrutinib in the third-line setting. However, using ibrutinib in the first-line led to significantly higher healthcare costs (incremental cost of $612,700), resulting in an ICER of $2,350,041/QALY. The monthly cost of ibrutinib would need to be decreased by 72% for first-line ibrutinib therapy to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY. In a scenario analysis where ibrutinib was used in the second-line in the delayed ibrutinib arm, first-line ibrutinib had an incremental cost of $478,823, an incremental effectiveness of 0.05 QALYs, and an ICER of $9,810,360/QALY when compared to second-line use. These data suggest that first-line ibrutinib for unselected older adults with CLL is unlikely to be cost-effective under current pricing. Delaying ibrutinib for most patients with CLL until later lines of therapy may be a reasonable strategy to limit healthcare costs without compromising clinical outcomes.

23695,Cost-effectiveness of Contemporary Statin Use Guidelines With or Without Coronary Artery Calcium Assessment in African American Individuals,"Importance: Clinical and economic consequences of statin treatment guidelines supplemented by targeted coronary artery calcium (CAC) assessment have not been evaluated in African American individuals, who are at increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and less likely than non-African American individuals to receive statin therapy. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline without a recommendation for CAC assessment vs the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline recommendation for use of a non-0 CAC score measured on one occasion to target generic-formulation, moderate-intensity statin treatment in African American individuals at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: A microsimulation model was designed to estimate life expectancy, quality of life, costs, and health outcomes over a lifetime horizon. African American-specific data from 472 participants in the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and other US population-specific data on individuals from published sources were used. Data analysis was conducted from November 11, 2018, to November 1, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), discounted at 3% annually. Results: In a model-based economic evaluation informed in part by follow-up data, the analysis was focused on 472 individuals in the JHS at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; mean (SD) age was 63 (6.7) years. The sample included 243 women (51.5%) and 229 men (48.5%). Of these, 178 of 304 participants (58.6%) who underwent CAC assessment had a non-0 CAC score. In the base-case scenario, implementation of 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines without CAC assessment provided a greater quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.0027 QALY) at a higher cost ($428.97) compared with the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline strategy with CAC assessment, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $158325/QALY, which is considered to represent low-value care by the ACC/AHA definition. The 2018 ACC/AHA guideline strategy with CAC assessment provided greater quality-adjusted life expectancy at a lower cost compared with the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines without CAC assessment when there was a strong patient preference to avoid use of daily medication therapy. In probability sensitivity analyses, the 2018 ACC/AHA guideline strategy with CAC assessment was cost-effective compared with the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines without CAC assessment in 76% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay value of $100000/QALY when there was a preference to lose 2 weeks of perfect health to avoid 1 decade of daily therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: A CAC assessment-guided strategy for statin therapy appears to be cost-effective compared with initiating statin therapy in all African American individuals at intermediate risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and may provide greater quality-adjusted life expectancy at a lower cost than a non-CAC assessment-guided strategy when there is a strong patient preference to avoid the need for daily medication.

23696,Cost-Effectiveness of Depression Screening for Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Residents,"OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of screening and treating otolaryngology-head and neck surgery residents for depression. METHODS: A Markov model was built using TreeAgePro, version 2019 (TreeAge Software Inc.; Williamstown, MA) to assess the cost-effectiveness of five potential treatment algorithms: 1) treat all residents with psychotherapy, 2) screen and treat depressed residents with psychotherapy, 3) screen and treat depressed residents with pharmacotherapy, 4) screen and treat depressed residents with combination psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy, and 5) no intervention. A Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), consisting of 1 thousand simulations over a cumulative 5-year period, was performed to evaluate both base case values and a range of values for model variables. RESULTS: Screening residents for depression and treating with combination psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy was cost-effective and the optimal strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 thousand per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). This option demonstrated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,578 per QALY for base case values. PSA confirmed these results and demonstrated that screening residents for depression and treating with either combination pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy alone, or psychotherapy alone were cost-effective options in 94.9% of simulations. CONCLUSION: Depression and burnout remain crucial issues among resident physicians. This study demonstrates that actively screening residents for depression is cost-effective. Based on these results, residency programs may consider trialing standardized depression screening protocols. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I and II. Laryngoscope, 2020.

23700,Identification of Abusive Head Trauma in High-Risk Infants: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abusive head trauma detection strategies in emergency department (ED) settings with and without rapid magnetic resonance imaging (rMRI) availability. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov decision model estimated outcomes in well-appearing infants with high-risk chief complaints. In an ED without rMRI, we considered 3 strategies: clinical judgment, universal head computed tomography (CT), or Pittsburgh Infant Brain Injury Score (PIBIS) with CT. In an ED with rMRI for brain availability, we considered additional strategies: universal rMRI, universal rMRI with CT, PIBIS with rMRI, and PIBIS with rMRI followed by CT . Correct diagnosis eliminated future risk; missed AHT led to re-injury risk with associated poor outcomes. Cohorts were followed for one year from a healthcare perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Main outcomes evaluated in this study were AHT correctly identified and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: Without rMRI availability, PIBIS followed by CT was the most cost-effective strategy. Results were sensitive to variation of CT-induced cancer parameters and AHT prevalence. When rMRI was available, universal rMRI followed by confirmatory CT cost $25,791 to gain one additional quality-adjusted life-year compared with PIBIS followed by rMRI with confirmatory CT. In both models, clinical judgement was less effective than alternative strategies. CONCLUSIONS: By applying CT to a more targeted population, PIBIS decreases radiation exposure and is more effective for AHT identification compared with clinical judgment. When rMRI is available, universal rMRI with CT is more effective than PIBIS and is economically favorable. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.
