8501,Screening for malignancy after augmentation cystoplasty in children with spina bifida: a decision analysis,"Augmentation cystoplasty is the mainstay of surgical treatment for medically refractory neurogenic bladder in patients with spina bifida. Concerns regarding an increased risk of malignancy have prompted many centers to consider routine postoperative screening. We examine the potential cost-effectiveness of such screening.A Markov model was used to compare 2 screening strategies among patients with spina bifida after cystoplasty, namely annual screening cystoscopy and cytology and usual care. Model parameters were informed via a systematic review of post-augmentation malignancy and cost estimates from published reports or government sources.In a hypothetical cohort the individual increase in life expectancy for the entire cohort was 2.3 months with an average lifetime cost of $55,200 per capita, for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $273,718 per life-year gained. One-way and two-way sensitivity analyses suggest the screening strategy could be cost effective if the annual rate of cancer development were more than 0.26% (12.8% lifetime risk) or there were a greater than 50% increase in screening effectiveness and cancer risk after augmentation. After adjusting for multiple levels of uncertainty the screening strategy had only an 11% chance of being cost effective at a $100,000 per life-year threshold or a less than 3% chance of being cost effective at $100,000 per quality adjusted life-year.Annual screening for malignancy among patients with spina bifida with cystoplasty using cystoscopy and cytology is unlikely to be cost effective at commonly accepted willingness to pay thresholds. This conclusion is sensitive to a higher than expected risk of malignancy and to highly optimistic estimates of screening effectiveness.",2011-01-08068,21855939,J Urol,Paul J Kokorowski,2011,186 /,1437-43,No,21855939,"Paul J Kokorowski; Jonathan C Routh; Joseph G Borer; Carlos R Estrada; Stuart B Bauer; Caleb P Nelson; Screening for malignancy after augmentation cystoplasty in children with spina bifida: a decision analysis, J Urol, ; 186 ():0022-5347; 1437-43",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Annual screening for malignancy using cystoscopy and cytology and usual care vs. Usual care (annual office visit and renal ultrasound),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2010,Not Stated
8502,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of biologic treatments for psoriatic arthritis,"A probabilistic model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of three biologics, etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab, compared with palliative care for the treatment of active and progressive PsA in patients who have an inadequate response to standard treatment (including DMARDs).A previous model was revised to evaluate the impact of biologics on both skin and joint disease and to include new evidence from the clinical review and evidence synthesis. Initial response to biologics was determined using the PsA response criteria. The impact of biologics on the arthritis component of the disease is then modelled via a change in the HAQ and the impact of the psoriasis component measured using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index.For PsA patients with mild to moderate skin disease, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for etanercept vs palliative care is around ?18 000, and the ICER for infliximab vs etanercept is around ?44 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Adalimumab is extendedly dominated. The probability that etanercept is cost effective is 0.436 at a threshold of ?20 000 per QALY. Etanercept is also likely to be cost effective for patients with moderate to severe psoriasis or negligible skin involvement.Further investigation is required to reduce uncertainties around a number of model parameters, in particular the length of time over which biologics are assumed to be effective and the progression of HAQ on and off treatment.",2011-01-08070,21859705,Rheumatology (Oxford),Laura Bojke,2011,50 Suppl 4 /,iv39-iv47,No,21859705,"Laura Bojke; David Epstein; Dawn Craig; Mark Rodgers; Nerys Woolacott; Huiqin Yang; Mark Sculpher; Modelling the cost-effectiveness of biologic treatments for psoriatic arthritis, Rheumatology (Oxford), ; 50 Suppl 4 ():1462-0324; iv39-iv47",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Etanercept vs. Palliative care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.50,3.50,15986,United Kingdom,2008,35636.47

8505,Cost effectiveness of chemoprevention for prostate cancer with dutasteride in a high-risk population based on results from the REDUCE clinical trial,"The REDUCE trial examined whether chemoprevention with the dual 5-alpha reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, reduced risk of prostate cancer (PCa) detection on biopsy.We examined the cost effectiveness of dutasteride compared with placebo in preventing PCa in men at increased risk as seen in REDUCE, from a US payer perspective.A Markov model was developed to compare costs and outcomes of chemoprevention with dutasteride 0.5?mg/day or placebo with usual care in men aged 50-75 years, with serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 2.5-10?ng/mL (men aged <60 years) or 3.0-10?ng/mL (men aged =60 years), and with a single negative prostate biopsy in the prior 6 months. The model simulated the REDUCE cohort annually through different health states over 4-, 10-year and lifetime time horizons. Risks of PCa for men receiving placebo and dutasteride were obtained from REDUCE. Rates of acute urinary retention events and benign prostate hyperplasia-related surgeries also came from REDUCE. Costs and utilities were obtained from published literature. All costs are reported in $US, year 2009 values. Results: The model indicated that, over 10 years, dutasteride patients would experience fewer PCas (251 vs 312 per 1000 patients) at increased cost ($US15?341 vs $US12?316) than placebo patients. Although life-years were not substantially affected, the model calculated an increase in QALYs of 0.14 for dutasteride patients. Chemoprevention with dutasteride appeared to be cost effective, with an incremental cost per QALY of $US21?781 and cost per PCa avoided of $US50?254. The 4-year and lifetime incremental costs per QALY were $US18?409 and $US22?498, respectively.Despite increased cost due to taking a drug for prevention, dutasteride 0.5?mg/day may be cost effective in men at increased risk for PCa.",2011-01-08073,21875161,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Michael W Kattan,2011,9 /,305-15,Yes,21875161,"Michael W Kattan; Stephanie R Earnshaw; Cheryl L McDade; Libby K Black; Gerald L Andriole; Cost effectiveness of chemoprevention for prostate cancer with dutasteride in a high-risk population based on results from the REDUCE clinical trial, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 9 ():1179-1896; 305-15",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Usual care plus chemoprevention with dutasteride (0.5 mg/day) vs. Usual care plus placebo,Not Stated,75 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,21781,United States,2009,26275.94

Predictive equations for time-to-progression (TTP) and post-progression survival (PPS) were developed by identifying the best fitting parametric survival distributions and selecting the most significant predictors. Disease and adverse event management was obtained via survey from Norwegian experts. Costs, derived from official Norwegian pricing data bases, included drug, administration, monitoring, and adverse event management costs.Complete or partial responders were 65% for LEN/DEX compared to 43% for bortezomib. Derived median TTP was 11.45 months for LEN/DEX compared to 5.15 months for bortezomib. LYs and QALYs were higher for LEN/DEX (4.06 and 2.95, respectively) than for bortezomib (3.11 and 2.19, respectively). The incremental costs per QALY and LY gained from LEN/DEX were NOK 247,978 and NOK 198,714, respectively, compared to bortezomib. Multiple sensitivity analyses indicated the findings were stable. The parameters with the greatest impact were 4-year time horizon (NOK 441,457/QALY) and higher bound confidence intervals for PPS (NOK 118,392).The model analyzed two therapies not compared in head-to-head trials, and predicted results using an equation incorporating patient-level characteristics. It is a limited estimation of the costs and outcomes in a Norwegian setting.The simulation model showed that treatment with LEN/DEX leads to greater LYs and QALYs when compared to bortezomib in the treatment of rrMM patients.

Data of 70 patients were completed during the study period and were analyzed.A health utility measure was made before and after the insertion of a BAHD to estimate the utility gain associated with this intervention.The cost and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain for each patient was established, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated.The results of our analysis are that, compared with current standard care, the BAHD has an ICER of ?17,610 (US $26,415) per QALY gained. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence will endorse a health intervention as cost-effective if the ICER is below ?20,000 to ?30,000 per QALY (US $30,000-45,000).This technology is likely to be cost-effective at the current thresholds used by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

Selected patients may benefit from stabilizing the fracture with cement through BKP, a minimally invasive procedure. BKP has been reported to give good short-time clinical results, and economic modeling has suggested that the procedure could be cost-effective after 2 years compared with standard treatment.Hospitalized patients with back pain due to VCF were randomized to BKP or to control using a computer-generated random list. All costs associated with VCF and cost-effectiveness were reported primarily from the perspective of society. We used EQ-5D to assess quality of life (QoL). The accumulated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs/QALY gained were assessed using intention to treat.Between February 2003 and December 2005, a total of 63 out of 67 Swedish patients were analyzed: BKP (n = 32) and control (n = 31). Societal cost per patient for BKP was SEK 160,017 (SD = 151,083) = ?16,668 (SD = 15,735), and for control SEK 84,816 (SD = 40,954) = ?8835 (SD = 4266), a significant difference of 75,198 (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 16,037-120,104) = ?7833 (95% CI = 1671-12,511). The accumulated difference in QALYs was 0.085 (95% CI = -0.132 to 0.306) in favor of BKP. Cost/QALY gained using BKP was SEK 884,682 = ?92,154 and US $134,043.In this randomized controlled trial, it was not possible to demonstrate that BKP was cost-effective compared with standard medical treatment in patients treated for an acute/subacute vertebral fracture due to osteoporosis.

8537,Cost-effectiveness of a recommendation of universal mass vaccination for seasonal influenza in the United States,"We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of universal mass vaccination (UMV) against influenza compared with a targeted vaccine program (TVP) for selected age and risk groups in the United States.We modeled costs and outcomes of seasonal influenza with UMV and TVP, taking a societal perspective. The US population was stratified to model age-specific (< 5, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+ years) vaccine coverage and efficacy. Probability of influenza-related illness (ILI) and complications, health-care utilization, costs, and survival were estimated. For a season's intervention, ILI cases in that year, lifetime costs (2008 US$), and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost (both discounted at 3% per annum) were calculated for each policy and used to derive incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A range of sensitivity and alternative-scenario analyses were conducted.In base-case analyses, TVP resulted in 63 million ILI cases, 859,000 QALYs lost, and $114.5 billion in direct and indirect costs; corresponding estimates for UMV were 61 million cases, 825,000 QALYs lost, and $111.4 billion. UMV was therefore estimated to dominate TVP, saving $3.1 billion and 34,000 QALYs. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, UMV was dominant in 82% and dominated in 0% of iterations. In alternative-scenario analyses, UMV dominated TVP when lower estimates of vaccine coverage were used. Lower estimates of ILI risk among unvaccinated, vaccine effectiveness, and risk of complications resulted in ICERs of $2800, $8100, and $15,900 per QALY gained, respectively, for UMV compared with TVP.UMV against seasonal influenza is cost saving in the United States under reasonable assumptions for coverage, cost, and efficacy.",2011-01-08114,21914499,Value Health,Karen M Clements,0,14 /,800-11,Yes,21914499,"Karen M Clements; Jeremy Chancellor; Kristin Nichol; Kelly DeLong; David Thompson; Cost-effectiveness of a recommendation of universal mass vaccination for seasonal influenza in the United States, Value Health, ; 14 ():1098-3015; 800-11",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Universal mass annual seasonal influenza vaccination for all persons aged 6 months and older vs. Targeted vaccine policy among children aged 6 months to 5 years of age, pregnant women, adults >50 years, persons of any age with certain chronic medical conditions with elevated health risk of influenza complications, nursing home and other long-term care residents, household contacts of and caregivers for high risk individuals",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-11882.35,United States,2008,-14283.52
8538,Cost-effectiveness of implantable defibrillators after myocardial infarction based on 8-year follow-up data (MADIT II),"About 190,000 Germans experience a myocardial infarction each year. Of these, 25% may be eligible for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) due to low left ventricular ejection fraction. Given the high costs of implantation, the purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ICDs compared to conventional therapy in patients with an ejection fraction 30% or less after MI in Germany.The economic evaluation was performed from the perspective of the German statutory health insurance. To simulate costs and effectiveness over lifetime, a Markov model was constructed with seven health states. The model was based on 8-year follow-up data for ICD implantation after myocardial infarction (MADIT II), which was published recently.The analysis shows that ICD implantation compared to conventional therapy in patients fulfilling MADIT-II criteria has a cost-effectiveness ratio of ?44,736 per quality-adjusted life year gained. If every patient insured by the statutory health insurance and fulfilling the MADIT-II criteria would receive an ICD, the model suggests expenditures between ?173 million and ?1.7 billion per year.ICD therapy cannot be considered clearly cost-effective when compared to many well-accepted interventions.

8544,A trial-based assessment of the cost-utility of bevacizumab and chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for advanced non-small cell lung cancer,"Bevacizumab is approved for treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in combination with chemotherapy based on a 2-month median survival benefit demonstrated in one randomized trial. The cost-utility of adding bevacizumab to chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC remains unknown. We evaluated the cost-utility of bevacizumab added to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC.We developed a Markov model to estimate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct medical costs from the US payer perspective in patients treated with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy and compared these outcomes with patients treated with chemotherapy alone. We populated the model with survival and toxicity data from the clinical trial that compared the two strategies. We obtained utilities from a literature search and unit costs from Medicare. We discounted QALYs and costs at 3% per year. We addressed uncertainty with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyzes.Compared with chemotherapy alone, bevacizumab and chemotherapy increased mean QALYs by 0.13, at an incremental life-time cost of US$72,000 per patient. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was US$560,000/QALY. The ICUR was most sensitive to the survival on bevacizumab treatment, the drug costs of bevacizumab, and the utility of stable disease on treatment. At a threshold of US$100,000/QALY, the addition of bevacizumab had a 0.2% probability of being cost-effective.Bevacizumab does not appear to be cost-effective when added to chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, based on approximate cost-effectiveness thresholds that have been identified in the United States.

8545,Cost-effectiveness of lanthanum carbonate in the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in chronic kidney disease before and during dialysis,"Hyperphosphatemia is a common and harmful condition in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We determined the cost-effectiveness of the noncalcium-based phosphate binder lanthanum carbonate (LC) as second-line treatment of hyperphosphatemia after therapy failure with calcium-based binders (CB).Two CKD populations were modeled: 1) predialysis CKD patients and 2) incident dialysis patients. Patients not responding to CB with a serum phosphate (SP) level >5.5 mg/dl received a trial with LC. Patients not responding to LC (SP >4.6 mg/dl) returned to CB treatment. Patient-level data were obtained from clinical trials in predialysis and dialysis. Time-dependent, life-long Markov models (discounting at 3.5% annually) were developed, using a UK National Health Service perspective.The health gains with second-line LC treatment compared to CB treatment were 44 and 56 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the predialysis and incident dialysis populations, respectively. Second-line LC was a cost-saving strategy in the predialysis population because of the cost-savings of delayed CKD progression. Second-line LC was cost-effective at ?6900 (90% probability interval: ?5800-?8300) per QALY gained in the dialysis population. Results were robust to plausible variations in other model parameters; inclusion of future unrelated dialysis costs had a large influence on cost-effectiveness estimates.Second-line treatment with LC is associated with considerable clinical benefits and good value for money in CKD, irrespective of dialysis status.

8547,Cost-effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring and intensive insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes,"ABSTRACT:Our objective was to determine the cost-effectiveness of Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) technology with intensive insulin therapy compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in adults with type 1 diabetes in the United States.A Markov cohort analysis was used to model the long-term disease progression of 12 different diabetes disease states, using a cycle length of 1 year with a 33-year time horizon. The analysis uses a societal perspective to model a population with a 20-year history of diabetes with mean age of 40. Costs are expressed in $US 2007, effectiveness in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Parameter estimates and their ranges were derived from the literature. Utility estimates were drawn from the EQ-5D catalogue. Probabilities were derived from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), and the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. Univariate and Multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted using 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.Compared to SMBG, use of CGM with intensive insulin treatment resulted in an expected improvement in effectiveness of 0.52 QALYs, and an expected increase in cost of $23,552, resulting in an ICER of approximately $45,033/QALY. For a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $100,000/QALY, CGM with intensive insulin therapy was cost-effective in 70% of the Monte Carlo simulations.CGM with intensive insulin therapy appears to be cost-effective relative to SMBG and other societal health interventions.",2011-01-08123,21917132,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,R Brett McQueen,2011,9 /,13,Yes,21917132,"R Brett McQueen; Samuel L Ellis; Jonathan D Campbell; Kavita V Nair; Patrick W Sullivan; Cost-effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring and intensive insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, ; 9 ():1478-7547; 13",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Monitoring HbA1c with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) to dictate intensive insulin therapy regimen vs. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) to dictate intensive insulin therapy regimen,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,33 Years,3.00,3.00,45033,United States,2007,56211.65
8548,The cost-effectiveness of telestroke in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke,"To conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of telestroke--a 2-way, audiovisual technology that links stroke specialists to remote emergency department physicians and their stroke patients--compared to usual care (i.e., remote emergency departments without telestroke consultation or stroke experts).A decision-analytic model was developed for both 90-day and lifetime horizons. Model inputs were taken from published literature where available and supplemented with western states' telestroke experiences. Costs were gathered using a societal perspective and converted to 2008 US dollars. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were combined with costs to generate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). In the lifetime horizon model, both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. Both one-way sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were performed.In the base case analysis, compared to usual care, telestroke results in an ICER of $108,363/QALY in the 90-day horizon and $2,449/QALY in the lifetime horizon. For the 90-day and lifetime horizons, 37.5% and 99.7% of 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations yielded ICERs <$50,000/QALY, a ratio commonly considered acceptable in the United States.When a lifetime perspective is taken, telestroke appears cost-effective compared to usual care, since telestroke costs are upfront but benefits of improved stroke care are lifelong. If barriers to use such as low reimbursement rates and high equipment costs are reduced, telestroke has the potential to diminish the striking geographic disparities of acute stroke care in the United States.",2011-01-08126,21917781,Neurology,R E Nelson,2011,77 /,1590-8,No,21917781,"R E Nelson; G M Saltzman; E J Skalabrin; B M Demaerschalk; J J Majersik; The cost-effectiveness of telestroke in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke, Neurology, ; 77 ():1526-632X; 1590-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Telestroke system: connecting remote community hospitals to tertiary hospitals staffed with stroke specialists by telestroke network vs. Usual care (no telestroke or consultation from stroke specialists),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2449,United States,2008,2943.89
8549,Cost-effectiveness of a pentavalent human-bovine reassortant rotavirus vaccine for children =5 years of age in Taiwan,"A Markov model was used to assess the impact of RV5, a pentavalent (G1, G2, G3, G4, P1A[8]) human bovine (WC3 strain) reassortant rotavirus vaccine, on reducing the healthcare burden and cost associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis (RGE) in Taiwan. Other cost-effectiveness analyses for rotavirus vaccination in industrialized countries have produced varying results depending on the input parameters assumed.Vaccination with RV5 is compared to no vaccination in a hypothetical cohort of Taiwanese children during their first 5 years of life to determine the per dose prices at which vaccination would be cost neutral or provide good value based on established standards from the healthcare (direct medical care costs only) and societal (all RGE-related costs) perspectives. The effects of vaccination on RGE healthcare utilization and days of parental work loss missed are based on results from the Rotavirus Efficacy and Safety Trial.Without vaccination there would be 122,526 symptomatic episodes of RGE. Universal vaccination would reduce RGE-related deaths, hospitalizations, emergency department, and outpatient visits by 91.7%, 92.1%, 83.7%, and 73.4%, respectively. The price per dose at which vaccination would be cost-neutral is US$ 21.80 (688 NTD) and US$ 26.20 (827 NTD) from the healthcare and societal perspectives, respectively. At $25 per dose, the cost per QALY gained is US$ 2261 (71,335 NTD) from the healthcare perspective and cost saving from the societal perspective. KEY LIMITATION: The model only assesses the effect of RV5 on vaccinated children and does not account for herd immunity.

8551,Cost-effectiveness of imaging strategies to reduce radiation-induced cancer risk in Crohn's disease,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to examine the cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance enterography (MRE) compared with computed tomography enterography (CTE) for routine imaging of small bowel Crohn's disease (CD) patients to reduce patients' life-time radiation-induced cancer risk. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the lifetime costs, benefits (measured in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] of survival and cancers averted) and cost-effectiveness of using MRE rather than CTE for routine disease monitoring in hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 20-year-old patients with CD. We assumed each CT radiation exposure conferred an incremental annual risk of developing cancer using the linear, no-threshold model. RESULTS: In the base case of 16 mSv per CTE, we estimated that radiation from CTE resulted in 1,206 to 20,146 additional cancers depending on the frequency of patient monitoring. Compared to using CTE only, using MRE until age 30 and CTE thereafter resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between $37,538 and $41,031 per life-year (LY) gained and between $52,969 and $57,772 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Using MRE until age 50 resulted in ICERs between $58,022 and $62,648 per LY gained and between $84,250 and $90,982 per QALY gained. In a threshold analysis, any use of MRE had an ICER of greater than $100,000 per QALY gained when CT radiation doses are less than 6.0 mSv per CTE exam. CONCLUSIONS: MRE is likely cost-effective compared to CTE in patients younger than age 50. Low-dose CTE may be an alternative cost-effective choice in the future.

METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the lifetime costs, benefits (measured in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] of survival and cancers averted) and cost-effectiveness of using MRE rather than CTE for routine disease monitoring in hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 20-year-old patients with CD. We assumed each CT radiation exposure conferred an incremental annual risk of developing cancer using the linear, no-threshold model. RESULTS: In the base case of 16 mSv per CTE, we estimated that radiation from CTE resulted in 1,206 to 20,146 additional cancers depending on the frequency of patient monitoring. Compared to using CTE only, using MRE until age 30 and CTE thereafter resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between $37,538 and $41,031 per life-year (LY) gained and between $52,969 and $57,772 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Using MRE until age 50 resulted in ICERs between $58,022 and $62,648 per LY gained and between $84,250 and $90,982 per QALY gained. In a threshold analysis, any use of MRE had an ICER of greater than $100,000 per QALY gained when CT radiation doses are less than 6.0 mSv per CTE exam.

METHODS: We developed a Markov model to compare the lifetime costs, benefits (measured in quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] of survival and cancers averted) and cost-effectiveness of using MRE rather than CTE for routine disease monitoring in hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 20-year-old patients with CD. We assumed each CT radiation exposure conferred an incremental annual risk of developing cancer using the linear, no-threshold model. RESULTS: In the base case of 16 mSv per CTE, we estimated that radiation from CTE resulted in 1,206 to 20,146 additional cancers depending on the frequency of patient monitoring. Compared to using CTE only, using MRE until age 30 and CTE thereafter resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between $37,538 and $41,031 per life-year (LY) gained and between $52,969 and $57,772 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Using MRE until age 50 resulted in ICERs between $58,022 and $62,648 per LY gained and between $84,250 and $90,982 per QALY gained. In a threshold analysis, any use of MRE had an ICER of greater than $100,000 per QALY gained when CT radiation doses are less than 6.0 mSv per CTE exam.

8586,"Is Drotrecogin alfa (activated) for adults with severe sepsis, cost-effective in routine clinical practice?","ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Previous cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) reported that Drotrecogin alfa (DrotAA) is cost-effective based on a Phase III clinical trial (PROWESS). There is little evidence on whether DrotAA is cost-effective in routine clinical practice. We assessed whether DrotAA is cost-effective in routine practice for adult patients with severe sepsis and multiple organ systems failing. METHODS: This CEA used data from a prospective cohort study that compared DrotAA versus no DrotAA (control) for severe sepsis patients with multiple organ systems failing admitted to critical care units in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The cohort study used case-mix and mortality data from a national audit, linked with a separate audit of DrotAA infusions. Re-admissions to critical care and corresponding mortality were recorded for four years. Patients receiving DrotAA (n = 1,076) were matched to controls (n = 1,650) with a propensity score (Pscore), and Genetic Matching (GenMatch). The CEA projected long-term survival to report lifetime incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) overall, and for subgroups with two or three to five organ systems failing at baseline. RESULTS: The incremental costs per QALY for DrotAA were ?30,000 overall, and ?16,000 for the subgroups with three to five organ systems failing. For patients with two organ systems failing, DrotAA resulted in an average loss of one QALY at an incremental cost of ?15,000. When the subgroup with two organ systems was restricted to patients receiving DrotAA within 24 hours, DrotAA led to a gain of 1.2 QALYs at a cost per QALY of ?11,000. The results were robust to other assumptions including the approach taken to projecting long-term outcomes.

8589,Economic evaluation of second generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in Norway,"A seven valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the Norwegian childhood immunization programme in 2006, and since then the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease has declined substantially. Recently, two new second generation pneumococcal conjugate vaccines have become available, and an update of the economic evidence is needed. The aim of this study was to estimate incremental costs, health effects and cost-effectiveness of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines PCV7, PCV13 and PHiD-CV in Norway.We used a Markov model to estimate costs and epidemiological burden of pneumococcal- and NTHi-related diseases (invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) and acute otitis media (AOM)) for a specific birth cohort. Using the most relevant evidence and assumptions for a Norwegian setting, we calculated incremental costs, health effects and cost-effectiveness for different vaccination strategies. In addition we performed sensitivity analyses for key parameters, tested key assumptions in scenario analyses and explored overall model uncertainty using probabilistic sensitivity analysis.The model predicts that both PCV13 and PHiD-CV provide more health gains at a lower cost than PCV7. Differences in health gains between the two second generation vaccines are small for invasive pneumococcal disease but larger for acute otitis media and myringotomy procedures. Consequently, PHiD-CV saves more disease treatment costs and indirect costs than PCV13.This study predicts that, compared to PVC13, PHiD-CV entails lower costs and greater benefits if the latter is measured in terms of quality adjusted life years. PVC13 entails more life years gained than PHiD-CV, but those come at a cost of NOK 3.1 million (~?0.4 million) per life year.

8592,Selection for early surgery in asymptomatic mitral regurgitation: a Markov model,"BACKGROUND: Current guidelines propose mitral valve repair in asymptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation (MR) when the likelihood of repair is 90% or more. As this figure is not evidence-based, we sought whether the results of a decision-analytic model could facilitate the selection between early surgery (ES) and watchful waiting (WW) based on current guidelines. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to reflect the anticipated health states in MR (pre-operative, post-operative, post-complication and death). Risks and transitions were informed by the literature. Implications of the strategies for survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost and cost-effectiveness were calculated from a US healthcare provider perspective. RESULTS: In the reference case (90% repair), QALY with ES was superior to WW (11.2 [0.4-21.3] vs 10.7 [95%CI: 1.0-21.3]) at an incremental cost-effectiveness of $54,659 ($45,030-$64,288) per QALY. Sensitivity analyses of health benefit showed the main variables influencing outcome were repair rate, operative mortality and risks of heart failure and death with medical management. At the registry repair rate (50%), outcomes of ES were worse than WW, and threshold analysis showed that a repair rate of 84% was required for ES to be superior. High medical risk (yearly heart failure risk 5.6 +/- 6.6% and mortality 2.5 +/- 4%) was the most favorable scenario for surgery; ES was more effective when mortality in the WW group was >3.5%/year.

8596,The clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination for adult women in the Netherlands,"The use of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines has been universally approved for women from age 12 to 25 years, but those older than 16 years receive no reimbursement for the cost of the vaccine in the Netherlands. Reductions in the vaccine price as well as new insights in the efficacy of HPV vaccines offer renewed arguments to consider HPV vaccination in adult women. We calculated the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of vaccinating women aged 17-25 years in 2010.The calculations were based on an individual-based simulation model for cervical carcinogenesis, with HPV infection risks obtained from a type-specific HPV transmission model. The indirect protective effect from vaccinating 12 to 16 year-old girls was adjusted for. Cervical screening in the model was incorporated according Dutch screening guidelines, i.e. 7 cytology-based rounds at 5-year intervals from the age of 30. As base-case, we assumed the vaccine to offer full protection against HPV16/18 only if no prior exposure to that type had occurred before vaccination. In sensitivity analyses, we considered partial cross-protection against types 31/33/45/58 and efficacy against all future infections, irrespective of previous or current infection status.In base-case analyses, vaccinating 17 year-olds reduced their lifetime risk of treatment for precancerous lesions from 7.77% to 3.48% and their lifetime cervical cancer risk from 0.52% to 0.24%. These risks were 6.12% and 0.45%, respectively, for a 25 year-old vaccinee. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vaccinating 17-25 year-olds was ?22,526 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) at a vaccine price of ?65 per dose, a 50% reduction of the 2010 pharmacy price in the Netherlands. If cross-protection against types 31/33/45/58 was included, the ICER decreased to ?14,734 per QALY. Results were robust to efficacy assumptions with respect to previous or current infection status.The clinical benefit of HPV vaccination of women up to 25 years moderately depends on cross-protection to non-vaccine types. Refunding the cost of the vaccine to 17-25 year-old women in the Netherlands can be considered cost-effective at anticipated price reductions.",2011-01-08160,21945961,Vaccine,Johannes A Bogaards,2011,29 /,8929-36,Yes,21945961,"Johannes A Bogaards; Veerle M H Coup?; Chris J L M Meijer; Johannes Berkhof; The clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination for adult women in the Netherlands, Vaccine, ; 29 ():1873-2518; 8929-36",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination vs. None,Not Stated,25 Years,17 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,22526,Euro,2010,35383.6

We sought to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness (beyond the duration of clinical trials) of low- and high-potency statins in patients at low cardiovascular risk and to estimate the impact on Canada's publicly funded health care system.Using Markov modelling, we performed a cost-utility analysis in which we compared low-potency statins (fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin) and high-potency statins (atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) with no statins in a simulated cohort of low-risk patients over a lifetime horizon. Model outcomes included costs (in 2010 Canadian dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and the cost per QALY gained.Over a lifetime horizon, the cost of managing a patient at low cardiovascular risk was estimated to be about $10,100 without statins, $15,200 with low-potency statins and $16,400 with high-potency statins. The cost per QALY gained with high-potency statins (v. no statins) was $21 300; the use of low-potency statins was not considered economically attractive.

Within a given health state, a patient may have a mild/moderate or severe exacerbation or die. Data from roflumilast clinical trials and published literature were used to populate model parameters. The model calculated health outcomes and costs for roflumilast/tiotropium therapy vs tiotropium monotherapy over a 5-year horizon. Incremental cost and benefits were then calculated as cost-effectiveness ratios, including cost per exacerbation avoided and cost per quality adjusted life year ($/QALY).Over a 5-year horizon, the estimated incremental costs per exacerbation and per severe exacerbation avoided were $589 and $5869, respectively, and the incremental cost per QALY was $15,815. One-way sensitivity analyses varying key parameters produced an incremental cost per QALY ranging from $1963-$32,773.A number of key parameters used in the model were obtained from studies in the literature that were conducted under different contexts. Specifically, the relative risk estimate for severe COPD patients originates from a small trial not designed to demonstrate the impact of roflumilast on frequency of exacerbations. In addition, the model extrapolates the relative risk estimates over periods of 5-30 years, even though the estimates were only observed in trials that spanned less than a year.The addition of roflumilast to tiotropium is cost-effective for the treatment of severe to very severe COPD patients.",2011-01-08169,21992217,J Med Econ,Shawn X Sun,2011,14 /,805-15,Yes,21992217,"Shawn X Sun; Maryna Marynchenko; Ritesh Banerjee; David Cheng; Michelle Mocarski; Donald Yin; Andrew P Yu; Eric Q Wu; Cost-effectiveness analysis of roflumilast/tiotropium therapy versus tiotropium monotherapy for treating severe-to-very severe COPD, J Med Econ, ; 14 ():1369-6998; 805-15",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Roflumilast/tiotropium therapy vs. Tiotropium monotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,15815,United States,2009,19078.74
