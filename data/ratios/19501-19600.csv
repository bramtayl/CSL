19501,Contrasting Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Screening Under Commercial Insurance vs. Medicare,"OBJECTIVES: Most cost-effectiveness analyses of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening assume Medicare payment rates and a lifetime horizon. Our aims were to examine the implications of differential payment levels and time horizons for commercial insurers vs. Medicare on the cost-effectiveness of CRC screening. METHODS: We used our validated Markov cohort simulation of CRC screening in the average risk US population to examine CRC screening at ages 50-64 under commercial insurance, and at ages 65-80 under Medicare, using a health-care sector perspective. Model outcomes included discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs per person, and incremental cost/QALY gained. RESULTS: Lifetime costs/person were 20-44% higher when assuming commercial payment rates rather than Medicare rates for people under 65. Most of the substantial clinical benefit of screening at ages 50-64 was realized at ages >/=65. For commercial payers with a time horizon of ages 50-64, fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) were cost-effective (<$61,000/QALY gained), but colonoscopy was costly (>$185,000/QALY gained). Medicare experienced substantial clinical benefits and cost-savings from screening done at ages <65, even if screening was not continued. Among those previously screened, continuing FOBT and FIT under Medicare was cost-saving and continuing colonoscopy was highly cost-effective (<$30,000/QALY gained), and initiating any screening in those previously unscreened was highly effective and cost-saving. CONCLUSIONS: Modeling suggests that CRC screening is highly cost-effective over a lifetime even when considering higher payment rates by commercial payers vs. Medicare. Screening may appear relatively costly for commercial payers if only a time horizon of ages 50-64 is considered, but it is predicted to yield substantial clinical and economic benefits that accrue primarily at ages >/=65 under Medicare.",2018-01-26965,29904156,Am J Gastroenterol,Uri Ladabaum,2018,/,,No,29904156,"Uri Ladabaum; Ajitha Mannalithara; Joel V Brill; Zachary Levin; M Kate Bundorf; Contrasting Effectiveness and Cost-Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Screening Under Commercial Insurance vs. Medicare, Am J Gastroenterol, 2018 Jul 2; ():0002-9270",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,Flexible sigmoidoscopy/fecal immunochemical testing vs. Flexible sigmoidoscopy/fecal occult blood testing,Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,88500,United States,2009,106763.74
19502,Cost-effectiveness analysis of internet-mediated cognitive behavioural therapy for depression in the primary care setting: results based on a controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial of internet-mediated cognitive behavioural therapy (ICBT) compared with treatment as usual (TaU) for patients with mild to moderate depression in the Swedish primary care setting. In particular, the objective was to assess from a healthcare and societal perspective the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ICBT versus TaU at 12 months follow-up. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a pragmatic effectiveness trial. SETTING: Sixteen primary care centres (PCCs) in south-west Sweden. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety patients diagnosed with mild to moderate depression at the PCCs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: ICERs calculated as (CostICBT-CostTaU)/(Health outcomeICBT-Health outcomeTaU)=DeltaCost/DeltaHealth outcomes, the health outcomes being changes in the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) score and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The total cost per patient for ICBT was 4044 Swedish kronor (SEK) (euro426) (healthcare perspective) and SEK47 679 (euro5028) (societal perspective). The total cost per patient for TaU was SEK4434 (euro468) and SEK50 343 (euro5308). In both groups, the largest cost was associated with productivity loss. The differences in cost per patient were not statistically significant. The mean reduction in BDI-II score was 13.4 and 13.8 units in the ICBT and TaU groups, respectively. The mean QALYs per patient was 0.74 and 0.79 in the ICBT and TaU groups, respectively. The differences in BDI-II score reduction and mean QALYs were not statistically significant. The uncertainty of the study estimates when assessed by bootstrapping indicated that no firm conclusion could be drawn as to whether ICBT treatment compared with TaU was the most cost-effective use of resources. CONCLUSIONS: ICBT was regarded to be as cost-effective as TaU as costs, health outcomes and cost-effectiveness were similar for ICBT and TaU, both from a healthcare and societal perspective.

19503,Cost-effectiveness of obinutuzumab plus bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab monotherapy for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients who relapse after or are refractory to a rituximab-containing regimen in the US,"AIMS: Obinutuzumab (GA101, G) was approved in February 2016 by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat follicular lymphoma (FL) patients who relapsed after, or are refractory to (R/R), a rituximab-containing regimen (R/R-rituximab). In the GADOLIN trial, R/R-rituximab patients who received G plus bendamustine (B) followed by G-monotherapy (G + B) for up to 2 years had significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to patients receiving B-monotherapy. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of G + B vs B-monotherapy for R/R-rituximab FL patients from a US payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patient outcomes were simulated using a 3-state area under the curve model including progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death. This study used R/R-rituximab data from the National LymphoCare Study to extrapolate the GADOLIN trial''s refractory FL progression-free and overall survival data to a R/R-rituximab FL population. Drug utilization and adverse events were based on trial data, and costs were based on Medicare reimbursements and drug wholesale acquisition costs in 2016. Utility estimates were derived from published literature. Post-progression treatment costs were based on observed post-progression therapies in GADOLIN. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model uncertainty. RESULTS: G + B resulted in an increase in quality-adjusted life years relative to B-monotherapy of 1.24 (95% CR = 0.61-1.87); the incremental total cost was $58,100 (95% CR = $54,500-$61,500). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $47,000 per QALY gained, and, based on probabilistic simulations, there was a 98% probability that G + B was cost-effective at the $100,000 per QALY threshold. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: This US-based analysis suggests that treatment with G + B compared to B-monotherapy is likely cost-effective in R/R-rituximab FL patients. Modeling a R/R-rituximab population based on a synthesis of GADOLIN and the National LymphoCare Study data introduces uncertainty in the analysis.

19504,Three Lymphadenectomy Strategies in Low-Risk Endometrial Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of three lymphadenectomy strategies in the management of low-risk endometrial carcinoma. METHODS: A decision analysis model compared three lymphadenectomy strategies in women undergoing minimally invasive surgery for low-risk endometrial carcinoma: 1) routine lymphadenectomy in all patients, 2) selective lymphadenectomy based on intraoperative frozen section criteria, and 3) sentinel lymph node mapping. Costs and outcomes were obtained from published literature and Medicare reimbursement rates. Costs categories consisted of hospital, physician, operating room, pathology, and lymphedema treatment. Effectiveness was defined as 3-year disease-specific survival adjusted for the effect of lymphedema (utility=0.8) on quality of life. A cost-utility analysis was performed comparing the different strategies. Multiple deterministic sensitivity analyses were done. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, routine lymphadenectomy had a cost of $18,041 and an effectiveness of 2.79 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Selective lymphadenectomy had a cost of $17,036 and an effectiveness of 2.81 QALYs, whereas sentinel lymph node mapping had a cost of $16,401 and an effectiveness of 2.87 QALYs. With a difference of $1,005 and 0.02 QALYs, selective lymphadenectomy was both less costly and more effective than routine lymphadenectomy, dominating it. However, with the lowest cost and highest effectiveness, sentinel lymph node mapping dominated the other modalities and was the most cost-effective strategy. These findings were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses varying the rates of lymphedema and lymphadenectomy, surgical approach (open or minimally invasive surgery), lymphedema utility, and costs. For the estimated 40,000 women undergoing surgery for low-risk endometrial carcinoma each year in the United States, the annual cost of routine lymphadenectomy, selective lymphadenectomy, and sentinel lymph node mapping would be $722 million, $681 million, and $656 million, respectively. CONCLUSION: Compared with routine and selective lymphadenectomy, sentinel lymph node mapping had the lowest costs and highest quality-adjusted survival, making it the most cost-effective strategy in the management of low-risk endometrial carcinoma.",2018-01-26989,29889752,Obstet Gynecol,Rudy S Suidan,2018,132 / 1,52-58,No,29889752,"Rudy S Suidan; Charlotte C Sun; Scott B Cantor; Andrea Mariani; Pamela T Soliman; Shannon N Westin; Karen H Lu; Sharon H Giordano; Larissa A Meyer; Three Lymphadenectomy Strategies in Low-Risk Endometrial Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Obstet Gynecol, 2018 Jul; 132(1):0029-7844; 52-58",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Surgical,Selective lymph node dissection vs. Sentinel lymph node mapping,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,-10583.33,United States,2016,-11412.51

19506,Cost-effectiveness of nonavalent HPV vaccination among males aged 22 through 26years in the United States,"INTRODUCTION: In the United States, routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination is recommended for females and males at age 11 or 12years; the series can be started at age 9years. Vaccination is also recommended for females through age 26years and males through age 21years. The objective of this study was to assess the health impact and cost-effectiveness of harmonizing female and male vaccination recommendations by increasing the upper recommended catch-up age of HPV vaccination for males from age 21 to age 26years. METHODS: We updated a published model of the health impact and cost-effectiveness of 9-valent human papillomavirus vaccine (9vHPV). We examined the cost-effectiveness of (1) 9vHPV for females aged 12 through 26years and males aged 12 through 21years, and (2) an expanded program including males through age 26years. RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, providing 9vHPV for females aged 12 through 26years and males aged 12 through 21years cost an estimated $16,600 (in 2016 U.S. dollars) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The estimated cost per QALY gained by expanding male vaccination through age 26years was $228,800 and ranged from $137,900 to $367,300 in multi-way sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness ratios we estimated are not so favorable as to make a strong economic case for recommending expanding male vaccination, yet are not so unfavorable as to preclude consideration of expanding male vaccination. The wide range of plausible results we obtained may underestimate the true degree of uncertainty, due to model limitations. For example, the cost per QALY might be less than our lower bound estimate of $137,900 had our model allowed for vaccine protection against re-infection. Models that specifically incorporate men who have sex with men (MSM) are needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of male HPV vaccination strategies.",2018-01-26993,29887325,Vaccine,Harrell W Chesson,2018,36 / 29,4362-4368,Yes,29887325,"Harrell W Chesson; Elissa Meites; Donatus U Ekwueme; Mona Saraiya; Lauri E Markowitz; Cost-effectiveness of nonavalent HPV vaccination among males aged 22 through 26years in the United States, Vaccine, 2018 Jul 5; 36(29):1873-2518; 4362-4368",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Immunization,"9vHPV Vaccination Expanded Scenario (Females and Males, 12-26 years) vs. 9vHPV Vaccinations Comparison Scenario (Females 12-26 years; Males, 12-21 years)",Not Stated,26 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,100 Years,3.00,3.00,260666.67,United States,2016,281089.3
19507,Cost-effectiveness analysis of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in Italy,"BACKGROUND: Stroke has a significant disease burden in terms of acute and long-term disability in Italy and throughout the world. Endovascular treatments for the management of a stroke event have been coupled in the past years with the possibility to mechanically remove the occlusion by means of specially designed thrombectomy devices, and their exclusive use showed levels of effectiveness in line with those of the existing pharmacological treatments. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) with the Solitaire Revascularization Device (stent retriever) for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs), comparing MT plus intravenous tissue plasminogen activation (MT plus IV t-PA) vs IV t-PA alone, in Italy.

CONCLUSIONS: MT plus IV t-PA for AIS patients with LVO is cost-effective from year 1 through year 3, and cost-saving from year 4 onward in the Italian context, achieving better results, both in terms of efficacy and in terms of resource consumption.",2018-01-27005,29882711,J Med Econ,Matteo Ruggeri,2018,21 / 9,902-911,Yes,29882711,"Matteo Ruggeri; Michele Basile; Andrea Zini; Salvatore Mangiafico; Elio Clemente Agostoni; Kyriakos Lobotesis; Jeffrey Saver; Silvia Coretti; Carlo Drago; Americo Cicchetti; Cost-effectiveness analysis of mechanical thrombectomy with stent retriever in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke in Italy, J Med Econ, 2018 Sep; 21(9):1369-6998; 902-911",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Surgical,"Mechanical thrombectomy + Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator, 5th year vs. Intravenous Tissue Plasminogen Activator, 5th year",Not Stated,Not Stated,66 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,-3969.71,Euro,2010,-6235.59
19512,Cost-effectiveness of pulse-echo ultrasonometry in osteoporosis management,"Purpose: Osteoporosis is asymptomatic morbidity of the elderly which develops slowly over several years. Osteoporosis diagnosis has typically involved Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) followed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in specialist care. Point-of-care pulse-echo ultrasound (PEUS) was developed to overcome DXA-related access issues and to enable faster fracture prevention treatment (FPT) initiation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two proposed osteoporosis management (POMs: FRAX-->PEUS-if-needed-->DXA-if-needed-->FPT-if-needed) pathways including PEUS compared with the current osteoporosis management (FRAX-->DXA-if-needed-->FPT-if-needed). Materials and methods: Event-based probabilistic cost-utility model with 10-year duration for osteoporosis management was developed. The model consists of a decision tree for the screening, testing, and diagnosis phase and is followed by a Markov model for the estimation of incidence of four fracture types and mortality. Five clinically relevant patient cohorts (potential primary FPT in women aged 75 or 85 years, secondary FPT in women aged 65, 75, or 85 years) were modeled in the Finnish setting. Generic alendronate FPT was used for those diagnosed with osteoporosis, including persistence overtime. Discounted (3%/year) incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was the primary outcome. Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), payer costs (year 2016 value) at per patient and population level, and cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers were modeled as secondary outcomes. Results: POMs were cost-effective in all patient subgroups with noteworthy mean per patient cost savings of euro121/76 (ranges euro107-132/52-96) depending on the scope of PEUS result interpretation (test and diagnose/test only, respectively) and negligible differences in QALYs gained in comparison with current osteoporosis management. In the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers, POMs had 95%-100% probability of cost-effectiveness with willingness to pay euro24,406/QALY gained. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses.

Physiotherapy referral is standard management, and while awaiting treatment, advice is often given to rest, but the evidence base is weak. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of advice to remain active (AA) versus advice to rest (AR); and immediate physiotherapy (IP) versus usual care (waiting list) physiotherapy (UCP). Methods: Twenty-six-week within-trial economic evaluation (538 participants aged >/=18 years randomized to usual care, i.e. AA (n = 178), AR (n = 182) or IP (n = 178). Regression analysis estimated differences in mean costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).

19525,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: A Randomized Control Trial among Norwegian Youth,"Traumatic events by young people can adversely affect their psychological and social well-being when left untreated. This can result in high costs for society. In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT) is a cost-effective alternative to therapy as usual (TAU). Individual-level data were collected from 2008 to 2013, as part of a randomized control trial in Norwegian youth, 10-18 years of age, presenting with symptoms of posttraumatic stress (N = 156). Health outcomes, costs, and patient and family characteristics were recorded. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was measured with the 16D instrument, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were derived; total costs included the costs of therapy, and last we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ratio of differences in costs and QALYs gained). We performed nonparametric bootstrapping and used the results to draw a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve depicting the probability that TF-CBT is cost-effective. HRQoL increased in both treatment groups, whereas no significant differences in QALYs were observed. Resource use measured in minutes per session was significantly higher in the TF-CBT group; however, total minutes of therapy and costs were not significantly different between the two groups. In addition, use of resources, such as psychological counseling services, welfare services, and medication, was lower in the TF-CBT group posttreatment. The likelihood of TF-CBT being cost-effective varied from 91% to 96%. TF-CBT is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to standard treatment and should be recommended as the guideline treatment for youth with posttraumatic stress disorder.",2018-01-27020,29877724,J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol,Eline Aas,2018,/,1-14,No,29877724,"Eline Aas; Tor Iversen; Tonje Holt; Silje M Ormhaug; Tine K Jensen; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: A Randomized Control Trial among Norwegian Youth, J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol, 2018 Aug 7; ():1537-4424; 1-14",QALY,Norway,Not Stated,Health Education or Behavior,Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Treatment regularly provided in mental health clinics,Not Stated,18 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,18 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-37375,Norway,2016,-4804.79
19526,Cost-effectiveness analysis of sequential biologic therapy with ixekizumab versus secukinumab as first-line treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the UK,"AIMS: Patients with psoriasis often undergo treatment with a sequence of biologic agents because of poor/loss of response to initial therapy. With the availability of newer agents like ixekizumab and secukinumab, there is a need for cost-effectiveness analyses to better reflect current clinical practice. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a sequence of biologic therapies containing first-line ixekizumab vs first-line secukinumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of ixekizumab and secukinumab treatment sequences: ixekizumab --> ustekinumab --> infliximab --> best supportive care (BSC) vs secukinumab --> ustekinumab --> infliximab --> BSC. The model used monthly cycles, and included four health states: trial period, treatment maintenance, BSC, and death. At the end of the trial period, responders transitioned to maintenance therapy; non-responders transitioned to the next biologic in the sequence. An annual discontinuation rate of 20% was assumed for maintenance therapy. RESULTS: The ixekizumab sequence provided cost savings of pound898 ( pound176,203 vs 177,101) [year 2015 values] and gained 0.03 more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs: 1.45 vs 1.42) vs the secukinumab sequence over the lifetime horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed an 89.8% likelihood that the ixekizumab sequence would be cost-effective at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained. LIMITATIONS: The analysis used list prices for drugs rather than confidential, preferentially priced Patient Access Scheme costs. In addition, efficacy input data were based on a network meta-analysis, as there were no head-to-head trials comparing ixekizumab and secukinumab. CONCLUSION: First-line treatment with ixekizumab as part of a specific sequential biologic therapy for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the UK provided slight advantages in cost savings and QALYs gained over a similar treatment sequence initiated with secukinumab. In view of the small magnitude of these differences, factors such as patient preferences (e.g. for number of injections) and long-term safety (e.g. related to time on the market) may also be important for clinical decision-making.",2018-01-27025,29873270,J Med Econ,Erin Colleen Johansson,2018,21 / 8,810-820,Yes,29873270,"Erin Colleen Johansson; Susanne Hartz; Sandeep Himatlal Kiri; Gayathri Kumar; Axel Svedbom; Cost-effectiveness analysis of sequential biologic therapy with ixekizumab versus secukinumab as first-line treatment of moderate-to-severe psoriasis in the UK, J Med Econ, 2018 Aug; 21(8):1369-6998; 810-820",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Ixekizumab -> ustekinumab -> infliximab -> Best supportive care vs. Secukinumab -> ustekinumab -> infliximab -> Best supportive care,Moderate-to-severe,Not Stated,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-29933.33,United Kingdom,2015,-49960.28

Design This study was a retrospective chart review. Setting This study was conducted at a tertiary care center. Participants The study group consisted of 68 patients with transsphenoidal surgeries between January 2007 and January 2014. Main Outcome Measures Two-sample t -tests and Pearson''s chi-square test evaluated inpatient costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), volumetric EOR, and neurological outcomes. Results Total inpatient costs per patient was $22,853 in the microscopic group and less ($19,736) in the endoscopic group ( p = 0.049). Operating room costs were $5,974 in the microscopic group and lower in the endoscopic group ($5,045; p = 0.038). Operative time was 203.6 minutes in the microscopic group and 166.3 minutes in the endoscopic group ( p = 0.032). The QALY score, length of hospital stay, and postoperative outcomes were found to be similar between the two cohorts. Multivariate linear regression modeling suggested that length of stay ( p < 0.001) and operative time ( p = 0.008) were important factors that influenced total inpatient costs following transsphenoidal surgery. Conclusion This study shows that transsphenoidal surgery is more cost effective with the endoscopic approach than with the microscopic approach and depends on efficiency in the operating room as well as reduction in the length of hospitalization.",2018-01-27031,29868317,J Neurol Surg B Skull Base,Chikezie Ikechukwu Eseonu,2018,79 / 2,131-138,No,29868317,"Chikezie Ikechukwu Eseonu; Karim ReFaey; Oscar Garcia; Roberto Salvatori; Alfredo Quinones-Hinojosa; Comparative Cost Analysis of Endoscopic versus Microscopic Endonasal Transsphenoidal Surgery for Pituitary Adenomas, J Neurol Surg B Skull Base, 2018 Apr; 79(2):2193-6331; 131-138",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Surgical,Endoscopic transsphenoideal surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- Microscopic Endonasal Transsphenoidal Surgery,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,-17316.67,United States,2015,-18908.96
19530,Cost-effectiveness of generic pan-genotypic sofosbuvir/velpatasvir versus genotype-dependent direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C treatment,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection with low-cost generic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) available in India and other developing countries needs determination of HCV genotype (""genotype-dependent"" regimens). Generic velpatasvir, a DAA that obviates the need for genotype determination (""pan-genotypic"" regimen), recently became available but is costlier. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of genotype-dependent versus pan-genotypic DAA treatments in India. METHODS: A previously validated microsimulation model, adapted to Indian population, was used to compare the costs and long-term outcomes of three scenarios: no treatment, treatment with genotype-dependent regimens, and treatment with pan-genotypic regimen. Input parameters were derived from literature. Using a payer''s perspective and lifetime time horizon, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: At the current price ($US223 for 4 weeks), pan-genotypic regimen was cost-saving compared with no treatment. Compared with genotype-dependent regimens, it increased QALYs by 0.92 and increased costs by $US107 but was deemed cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $US242 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis also supported the cost-effectiveness of pan-genotypic regimen. At the reduced price of $US188 for 4 weeks, the pan-genotypic regimen will become cost-neutral to genotype-dependent regimens (current price: $US100 for 4 weeks).

METHODS: A previously validated microsimulation model, adapted to Indian population, was used to compare the costs and long-term outcomes of three scenarios: no treatment, treatment with genotype-dependent regimens, and treatment with pan-genotypic regimen. Input parameters were derived from literature. Using a payer''s perspective and lifetime time horizon, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: At the current price ($US223 for 4 weeks), pan-genotypic regimen was cost-saving compared with no treatment. Compared with genotype-dependent regimens, it increased QALYs by 0.92 and increased costs by $US107 but was deemed cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $US242 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis also supported the cost-effectiveness of pan-genotypic regimen. At the reduced price of $US188 for 4 weeks, the pan-genotypic regimen will become cost-neutral to genotype-dependent regimens (current price: $US100 for 4 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: At current prices, velpatasvir-based pan-genotypic regimen is cost-effective for HCV treatment in India where generic drugs are available.

19544,The cost effectiveness of minimally invasive spine surgery in the treatment of adult degenerative scoliosis: a comparison of transpsoas and open techniques,"INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment improves quality of life in patients with adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS). However, open ADS surgeries are complex, large magnitude operations associated with a high rate of complications. The lateral transpsoas interbody fusion technique is a less invasive alternative to open ADS surgery, but less invasive techniques tend to be more expensive. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the transpsoas technique for patients with ADS over a 12-month time horizon from a public payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed based on a consecutive case series of patients who underwent ADS surgeries between 2006 and 2012. Effectiveness was expressed as the difference in patient reported preoperative and 12-month postoperative health-related quality of life (HRQOL), which was measured in quality-adjusted life years. Health-care resource use was tabulated based on a clinical chart review on an item-by-item basis. Unit cost data were obtained from published provincial costs in Alberta, Canada. All costs were adjusted to 2015 Canadian dollars. The base case analysis included costs for the surgery, initial hospitalization, and treatment for complications over a 12-month follow-up period. The uncomplicated case analysis included costs for the surgery and initial hospitalization only. The joint uncertainty surrounding the cost and HRQOL differences was estimated using bootstrapping with 10,000 replicates. RESULTS: A total of 10 open technique and 12 transpsoas technique T11-pelvis fusions were included in the analysis. In the base case analysis, the transpsoas technique was less costly compared with the open technique, total cost of $83,513 (95% CI: $72,772-$94,253) versus $111,381 (95% CI: $36,340-$186,423), respectively (incremental cost $27,869), and was associated with 0.06 more quality-adjusted life years and/or patient. However, in the uncomplicated case, the open technique was less costly compared with the transpsoas technique ($47,795 [95% CI: $39,003-$56,586] vs $76,510 [95% CI: $72,273-$80,746]), respectively, with an incremental cost of $28,715. Based on the probabilistic analysis of 10,000 bootstrap iterations for the base case analysis, the transpsoas technique was more effective and less costly compared with the open technique 57% of time. One-way deterministic sensitivity analysis by adjusting bone-morphogenetic protein-2 dosage further improved cost effectiveness of the transpsoas technique by lowering overall costs. CONCLUSIONS: Transpsoas surgeries were associated with better outcomes in terms of HRQOL and lower costs over 1-year follow-up period compared with more invasive open technique.

19545,Budesonide with multi-matrix technology as second-line treatment for ulcerative colitis: evaluation of long-term cost-effectiveness in the Netherlands,"AIMS: Budesonide with multi-matrix technology (MMX) is an oral corticosteroid, shown to have high topical activity against ulcerative colitis (UC) while maintaining low systemic bioavailability with few adverse events. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of budesonide MMX versus commonly used corticosteroids, in the second-line treatment of active mild-to-moderate UC in the Netherlands. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An eight-state Markov model with an 8 week cycle length captured remission, four distinct therapy stages, hospitalization, possible colectomy and mortality. Remission probability for budesonide MMX was based on the CORE-II study. Population characteristics were derived from the Dutch Inflammatory Bowel Disease South Limburg cohort (n = 598) and included patients with proctitis (39%), left-sided (42%) and extensive disease (19%). Comparators (topical budesonide foam and enema, oral budesonide and prednisolone) were selected based on current Dutch clinical practice. Treatment effects were evaluated by network meta-analysis using a Bayesian framework. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed over a 5 year time horizon from a societal perspective, with costs, health-state and adverse event utilities derived from published sources. Outcomes were weighted by disease extent distribution and corresponding comparators. RESULTS: Budesonide MMX was associated with comparable quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain versus foam and oral formulations (+0.01 QALYs) in the total UC population, whilst being cost-saving (EUR 366 per patient). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis evaluated an 86.6% probability of budesonide MMX being dominant (cost-saving with QALY gain) versus these comparators. Exploratory analysis showed similar findings versus prednisolone. LIMITATIONS: Differing definitions of trial end-points and remission across trials meant indirect comparison was not ideal. However, in the absence of head-to-head clinical data, these comparisons are reasonable alternatives and currently offer the only comparison of second-line UC treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In the present analysis, budesonide MMX was shown to be cost-effective versus comparators in the total UC population, for the second-line treatment of active mild-to-moderate UC in the Netherlands.",2018-01-27058,29857775,J Med Econ,Alexandre Gherardi,2018,21 / 9,869-877,Yes,29857775,"Alexandre Gherardi; Stephane Roze; Johan Kuijvenhoven; Ola Ghatnekar; Yum Lina Yip Sonderegger; Budesonide with multi-matrix technology as second-line treatment for ulcerative colitis: evaluation of long-term cost-effectiveness in the Netherlands, J Med Econ, 2018 Sep; 21(9):1369-6998; 869-877",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Budesonide with multi-matrix technology vs. Standard/Usual Care- Budesonide foam and oral budesonide,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,4.00,1.50,-40666.67,Euro,2016,-48525.76
19546,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the DiagnOSAS Screening Tool Compared With Polysomnography Diagnosis in Dutch Primary Care,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: The growing recognition of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) as a serious health condition, increasing waiting lists for sleep tests, and a high proportion of unnecessary referrals from general practice highlight the need for alternative diagnostic strategies for OSA. This study''s objective was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of DiagnOSAS, a screening tool that strives to facilitate fast and well-informed referral to hospitals and sleep clinics for diagnosis, in The Netherlands. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to assess cost-effectiveness in men aged 50 years. The diagnostic process of OSA was simulated with and without DiagnOSAS, taking into account the occurrence of hazardous OSA effects: car accidents, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The cost-effectiveness of ""DiagnOSAS Strategy"" and a ""Rapid Diagnosis Scenario,"" in which time to diagnosis was halved, was assessed. RESULTS: Base case results show that, within a 10-year time period, DiagnOSAS saves euro226 per patient at a negligible decrease (< 0.01) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro56,997/QALY. The ""Rapid Diagnosis Scenario"" dominates usual care (ie, is both cheaper and more effective). For a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000/QALY the probability that the ""DiagnOSAS Strategy"" and ""Rapid Diagnosis Scenario"" are cost-effective equals 91.7% and 99.3%, respectively.

The cost-effectiveness of ""DiagnOSAS Strategy"" and a ""Rapid Diagnosis Scenario,"" in which time to diagnosis was halved, was assessed. RESULTS: Base case results show that, within a 10-year time period, DiagnOSAS saves euro226 per patient at a negligible decrease (< 0.01) in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro56,997/QALY. The ""Rapid Diagnosis Scenario"" dominates usual care (ie, is both cheaper and more effective). For a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000/QALY the probability that the ""DiagnOSAS Strategy"" and ""Rapid Diagnosis Scenario"" are cost-effective equals 91.7% and 99.3%, respectively.

19550,Cost-effectiveness of preoperative motor mapping with navigated transcranial magnetic brain stimulation in patients with high-grade glioma,"OBJECTIVE Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is used to identify the motor cortex prior to surgery. Yet, there has, until now, been no published evidence on the economic impact of nTMS. This study aims to analyze the cost-effectiveness of nTMS, evaluating the incremental costs of nTMS motor mapping per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY). By doing so, this study also provides a model allowing for future analysis of general cost-effectiveness of new neuro-oncological treatment options. METHODS The authors used a microsimulation model based on their cohort population sampled for 1000 patients over the time horizon of 2 years. A health care provider perspective was used to assemble direct costs of total treatment. Transition probabilities and health utilities were based on published literature. Effects were stated in QALYs and established for health state subgroups. RESULTS In all scenarios, preoperative mapping was considered cost-effective with a willingness-to-pay threshold < 3*per capita GDP (gross domestic product). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of nTMS versus no nTMS was 45,086 Euros/QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed robust results with a high impact of total treatment costs and utility of progression-free survival. Comparing the incremental costs caused by nTMS implementation only, the ICER decreased to 1967 Euros/QALY. CONCLUSIONS Motor mapping prior to surgery provides a cost-effective tool to improve the clinical outcome and overall survival of high-grade glioma patients in a resource-limited setting. Moreover, the model used in this study can be used in the future to analyze new treatment options in neuro-oncology in terms of their general cost-effectiveness.",2018-01-27068,29852777,Neurosurg Focus,Vicki M Butenschon,2018,44 / 6,E18,No,29852777,"Vicki M Butenschon; Sebastian Ille; Nico Sollmann; Bernhard Meyer; Sandro M Krieg; Cost-effectiveness of preoperative motor mapping with navigated transcranial magnetic brain stimulation in patients with high-grade glioma, Neurosurg Focus, 2018 Jun; 44(6):1092-0684; E18",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Diagnostic,Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Motor mapping without navigated transcranial magnetic brain stimulation,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,45086,Euro,2016,53799.16
19551,Cost-effectiveness of Osimertinib in the First-Line Treatment of Patients With EGFR-Mutated Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer,"Importance: The survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations has improved substantially in the last decade with the development of targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Osimertinib, a third-generation TKI that is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients who develop EGFR T790M mutations, has recently shown improved clinical outcomes compared with gefitinib and erlotinib for treatment-naive patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib for the first-line treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Design, Setting, and Participants: For this cost-effectiveness analysis, we extracted individual patient data from the FLAURA randomized clinical trial and used findings of our earlier meta-analysis to develop a decision-analytic model and determine the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib (AZD9291) compared with first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs over a 10-year time horizon. All direct costs were based on US and Brazilian payer perspectives. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome of this study was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by using osimertinib compared with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKIs in previously untreated EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Results: In the base case using the data as reported in the FLAURA trial, the incremental QALY for osimertinib was 0.594 compared with the first- and second-generation EGFR-TKIs. In the United States, the osimertinib ICERs were $226527 vs erlotinib, $231123 vs gefitinib, and $219874 vs afatinib. In Brazil, the ICERs were $162329, $180804, and $175432, respectively. The overall survival (95% CI) reported in the FLAURA trial (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.45-0.88) had the strongest association with the ICER (ranging from $84342 to $859771). Osimertinib price adjustments to the FLAURA trial data improved cost-effectiveness. For example, a discount of 10% on osimertinib acquisition cost was associated with a 20% decreased ICER compared with the base case ICER, and a discount of 20% on osimertinib acquisition cost was associated with a 40% decreased ICER compared with the base case ICER.

19557,The Cost-Effectiveness of Rapid Diagnostic Testing for the Diagnosis of Bloodstream Infections with or without Antimicrobial Stewardship,"Bloodstream infections are associated with considerable morbidity and health care costs. Molecular rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) are a promising complement to conventional laboratory methods for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections and may reduce the time to effective therapy among patients with bloodstream infections. The concurrent implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) may reinforce these benefits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectivenesses of competing strategies for the diagnosis of bloodstream infection alone or combined with an ASP. To this effect, we constructed a decision-analytic model comparing 12 strategies for the diagnosis of bloodstream infection. The main arms compared the use of mRDT and conventional laboratory methods with or without an ASP. The baseline strategy used as the standard was the use of conventional laboratory methods without an ASP, and our decision-analytic model assessed the cost-effectivenesses of 5 principal strategies: mRDT (with and without an ASP), mRDT with an ASP, mRDT without an ASP, conventional laboratory methods with an ASP, and conventional laboratory methods without an ASP. Furthermore, based on the availability of data in the literature, we assessed the cost-effectivenesses of 7 mRDT subcategories, as follows: PCR with an ASP, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis with an ASP, peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) with an ASP, a blood culture nanotechnology microarray system for Gram-negative bacteria (BC-GP) with an ASP, a blood culture nanotechnology microarray system for Gram-positive bacteria (BC-GN) with an ASP, PCR without an ASP, and PNA-FISH without an ASP. Our patient population consisted of adult inpatients in U.S. hospitals with suspected bloodstream infection. The time horizon of the model was the projected life expectancy of the patients. In a base-case analysis, cost-effectiveness was determined by calculating the numbers of bloodstream infection deaths averted, the numbers of quality-adjusted life years gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). In a probabilistic analysis, uncertainty was addressed by plotting cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves for various willingness-to-pay thresholds. In the base-case analysis, MALDI-TOF analysis with an ASP was the most cost-effective strategy, resulting in savings of $29,205 per quality-adjusted life year and preventing 1 death per 14 patients with suspected bloodstream infection tested compared to conventional laboratory methods without an ASP (ICER, -$29,205/quality-adjusted life year). BC-GN with an ASP (ICER, -$23,587/quality-adjusted life year), PCR with an ASP (ICER, -$19,833/quality-adjusted life year), and PCR without an ASP (ICER, -$21,039/quality-adjusted life year) were other cost-effective options. In the probabilistic analysis, mRDT was dominant and cost-effective in 85.1% of simulations. Importantly, mRDT with an ASP had an 80.0% chance of being cost-effective, while mRDT without an ASP had only a 41.1% chance.

Molecular rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) are a promising complement to conventional laboratory methods for the diagnosis of bloodstream infections and may reduce the time to effective therapy among patients with bloodstream infections. The concurrent implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) may reinforce these benefits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectivenesses of competing strategies for the diagnosis of bloodstream infection alone or combined with an ASP. To this effect, we constructed a decision-analytic model comparing 12 strategies for the diagnosis of bloodstream infection. The main arms compared the use of mRDT and conventional laboratory methods with or without an ASP. The baseline strategy used as the standard was the use of conventional laboratory methods without an ASP, and our decision-analytic model assessed the cost-effectivenesses of 5 principal strategies: mRDT (with and without an ASP), mRDT with an ASP, mRDT without an ASP, conventional laboratory methods with an ASP, and conventional laboratory methods without an ASP. Furthermore, based on the availability of data in the literature, we assessed the cost-effectivenesses of 7 mRDT subcategories, as follows: PCR with an ASP, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) analysis with an ASP, peptide nucleic acid fluorescent in situ hybridization (PNA-FISH) with an ASP, a blood culture nanotechnology microarray system for Gram-negative bacteria (BC-GP) with an ASP, a blood culture nanotechnology microarray system for Gram-positive bacteria (BC-GN) with an ASP, PCR without an ASP, and PNA-FISH without an ASP. Our patient population consisted of adult inpatients in U.S. hospitals with suspected bloodstream infection. The time horizon of the model was the projected life expectancy of the patients. In a base-case analysis, cost-effectiveness was determined by calculating the numbers of bloodstream infection deaths averted, the numbers of quality-adjusted life years gained, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). In a probabilistic analysis, uncertainty was addressed by plotting cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves for various willingness-to-pay thresholds. In the base-case analysis, MALDI-TOF analysis with an ASP was the most cost-effective strategy, resulting in savings of $29,205 per quality-adjusted life year and preventing 1 death per 14 patients with suspected bloodstream infection tested compared to conventional laboratory methods without an ASP (ICER, -$29,205/quality-adjusted life year).

Methods: A model was developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness based on non-severe hypoglycemia, body mass index, and pharmacy costs over 1 year. Published rates of non-severe hypoglycemia were employed in the T1D and T2D analyses, while reduced weight gain with IDet was modeled in the T2D analysis only. Effectiveness was calculated in terms of quality-adjusted life expectancy using published utility scores. Pharmacy costs were captured using published prices and defined daily doses. Costs were expressed in 2016 pounds sterling (GBP). Sensitivity analyses were performed (including probabilistic sensitivity analysis). Results: In T1D, IDet was associated with fewer non-severe hypoglycemic events than NPH insulin (126.7 versus 150.8 events per person-year), leading to an improvement of 0.099 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs with IDet were GBP 60 higher, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 610 per QALY gained. In T2D, mean non-severe hypoglycemic event rates and body weight were lower with IDet than NPH insulin, leading to a total incremental utility of 0.120, accompanied by an annual cost increase of GBP 171, yielding an ICER of GBP 1,422 per QALY gained for IDet versus NPH insulin. Conclusion: Short-term health economic evaluation showed IDet to be a cost-effective alternative to NPH insulin in the UK due to lower rates of non-severe hypoglycemia (T1D and T2D) and reduced weight gain (T2D only).",2018-01-27089,29844693,Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,Richard F Pollock,2018,11 /,217-226,No,29844693,"Richard F Pollock; Barrie Chubb; William J Valentine; Simon Heller; Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of insulin detemir versus neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in the UK using a short-term modeling approach, Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes, 2018; 11():1178-7007; 217-226",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Insulin detemir vs. Standard/Usual Care- Neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,610,United Kingdom,2016,891.65

19570,Cost-effectiveness analysis of magnetic resonance imaging-conditional pacemaker implantation: Insights from a multicenter study and implications in the current era,"BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-conditional pacemakers (M-PPMs) grant patients greater accessibility to MRI scans. The cost-effectiveness of implanting M-PPM is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of M-PPM implantation. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on patients receiving a M-PPM across 4 institutions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the sum of the total incremental cost of implanting a M-PPM vs a conventional pacemaker and the cost of MRI scans by the utility of MRI scans in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. QALY and lifespan of M-PPM (7-11 years) data were obtained from the literature. The benchmark of <$100,000 per QALY was used as the threshold for cost-effectiveness. Computer modeling/simulations were used to calculate the percentage of patients required to achieve this benchmark, to extrapolate the cumulative projected percentage of patients utilizing MRI scans over the lifespan of a M-PPM via the Weibull parametric survival model, and to conduct univariate and multivariate, probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The ICER during the follow-up period (21 +/- 17 months) was $451,569. The cost-effectiveness ICER benchmark is reached 7.0 years postimplantation, when a projected 38% of recipients would receive MRI scans. The projected percentage of patients receiving MRI scans at 11 years was 58%, yielding an ICER of $74,221 per QALY. Henceforth, assuming increased MRI usage in regular PPM based on Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services memo CAG00399R4 and decreased cost of M-PPM, M-PPM implantation is still cost-effective, with a lifetime ICER of $49,817 per QALY.

METHODS: Two Markov models including a chemotherapy and a post-chemotherapy models were constructed with a time horizon of 12 weeks and 30 years, respectively. All the transition probabilities and utility weights were derived from clinical trials and/or published literatures. The costs populated in the chemotherapy model were extracted from Medicare, Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme and the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. No cost was considered in the post-chemotherapy model. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: From the first chemotherapy model, lipegfilgrastim was associated with fewer episodes of severe neutropenia (SN) (N = 142 per 1000 patients treated), febrile neutropenia (FN) (N = 29 per 1000 patients treated), infection (N = 17 per 1000 patients treated) and chemotherapy delayed (N = 170 per 1000 patients treated) and lower cost ($116.88 less per patient treated).

19575,Cost-effectiveness analysis of lipegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis in women with breast cancer in Australia: a modelled economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of lipegfilgrastim versus pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis in women with early stage breast cancer. METHODS: Two Markov models including a chemotherapy and a post-chemotherapy models were constructed with a time horizon of 12 weeks and 30 years, respectively. All the transition probabilities and utility weights were derived from clinical trials and/or published literatures. The costs populated in the chemotherapy model were extracted from Medicare, Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme and the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. No cost was considered in the post-chemotherapy model. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: From the first chemotherapy model, lipegfilgrastim was associated with fewer episodes of severe neutropenia (SN) (N = 142 per 1000 patients treated), febrile neutropenia (FN) (N = 29 per 1000 patients treated), infection (N = 17 per 1000 patients treated) and chemotherapy delayed (N = 170 per 1000 patients treated) and lower cost ($116.88 less per patient treated). The post-chemotherapy model indicated lipegfilgrastim led to higher gains in both life years (18.72 versus 18.61) and quality-adjusted life years (17.28 versus 17.18) in comparison to pegfilgrastim. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results from the chemotherapy model is very sensitive to the baseline risk of SN; while from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, lipegfilgrastim was likely to be more cost-effective than pegfilgrastim based on two models.

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of ECT compared with pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: A decision analytic model integrating data on clinical efficacy, costs, and quality-of-life effects of ECT compared with pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy was used to simulate depression treatment during a 4-year horizon from a US health care sector perspective. Model input data were drawn from multiple meta-analyses, randomized trials, and observational studies of patients with depression. Where possible, data sources were restricted to US-based studies of nonpsychotic major depression. Data were analyzed between June 2017 and January 2018. Interventions: Six alternative strategies for incorporating ECT into depression treatment (after failure of 0-5 lines of pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy) compared with no ECT. Main Outcomes and Measures: Remission, response, and nonresponse of depression; quality-adjusted life-years; costs in 2013 US dollars; and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Strategies with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $100000 per quality-adjusted life-year or less were designated cost-effective. Results: Based on the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial, we simulated a population with a mean (SD) age of 40.7 (13.2) years, and 62.2% women. Over 4 years, ECT was projected to reduce time with uncontrolled depression from 50% of life-years to 33% to 37% of life-years, with greater improvements when ECT is offered earlier. Mean health care costs were increased by $7300 to $12000, with greater incremental costs when ECT was offered earlier. In the base case, third-line ECT was cost-effective, with an ICER of $54000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Third-line ECT remained cost-effective in a range of univariate, scenario, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Incorporating all input data uncertainty, we estimate a 74% to 78% likelihood that at least 1 of the ECT strategies is cost-effective and a 56% to 58% likelihood that third-line ECT is the optimal strategy. Conclusions and Relevance: For US patients with treatment-resistant depression, ECT may be an effective and cost-effective treatment option.

19582,Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection in patients aged >/=60 years (EXTEND): analysis of cost-effectiveness,"Objectives: The randomized Phase IIIb/IV EXTEND trial showed that extended-pulsed fidaxomicin significantly improved sustained clinical cure and reduced recurrence versus vancomycin in patients >/=60 years old with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Cost-effectiveness of extended-pulsed fidaxomicin versus vancomycin as first-line therapy for CDI was evaluated in this patient population. Methods: Clinical results from EXTEND and inputs from published sources were used in a semi-Markov treatment-sequence model with nine health states and a 1 year time horizon to assess costs and QALYs. The model was based on a healthcare system perspective (NHS and Personal Social Services) in England. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Patients receiving first-line extended-pulsed fidaxomicin treatment had a 0.02 QALY gain compared with first-line vancomycin (0.6267 versus 0.6038 QALYs/patient). While total drug acquisition costs were higher for extended-pulsed fidaxomicin than for vancomycin when used first-line ( pound1356 versus pound260/patient), these were offset by lower total hospitalization costs (which also included treatment monitoring and community care costs; pound10 815 versus pound11 459/patient) and lower costs of managing adverse events ( pound694 versus pound1199/patient), reflecting the lower incidence of CDI recurrence and adverse events with extended-pulsed fidaxomicin. Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin cost pound53 less per patient than vancomycin over 1 year. The probability that first-line extended-pulsed fidaxomicin was cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30 000/QALY was 76% in these patients. Conclusions: While fidaxomicin acquisition costs are higher than those of vancomycin, the observed reduced recurrence rate with extended-pulsed fidaxomicin makes it a more effective and less costly treatment strategy than vancomycin for first-line treatment of CDI in older patients.",2018-01-27114,29800295,J Antimicrob Chemother,Oliver A Cornely,2018,73 / 9,2529-2539,No,29800295,"Oliver A Cornely; Maureen Watt; Charles McCrea; Simon D Goldenberg; Enrico De Nigris; Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection in patients aged >/=60 years (EXTEND): analysis of cost-effectiveness, J Antimicrob Chemother, 2018 Sep 1; 73(9):0305-7453; 2529-2539",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Vancomycin,Hospitalized,Not Stated,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2312.23,United Kingdom,2016,-3379.83
19583,Cost-Effectiveness of Ribociclib plus Letrozole Versus Palbociclib plus Letrozole and Letrozole Monotherapy in the First-Line Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with HR+/HER2- Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer: A U.S. Payer Perspective,"BACKGROUND: U.S. regulatory approvals of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitors ribociclib and palbociclib as add-ons to letrozole greatly enhance the prospects for treating postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Clinical trials have established that the combination of a CDK 4/6 inhibitor with letrozole can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) versus letrozole monotherapy and is safe and well tolerated. Cost-effectiveness studies are required to inform payers and clinical decision makers on the money value of combination treatment in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ribociclib plus letrozole versus palbociclib plus letrozole and versus letrozole monotherapy in the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer from a U.S. private third-party payer perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival model including 3 health states (progression free, with either overall response or stable disease; progressed disease; and death) simulated lifetime costs and outcomes over a 40-year lifetime horizon with a 1-month cycle length. Clinical efficacy data (PFS and overall survival [OS]) were derived from a phase III trial of ribociclib plus letrozole (MONALEESA-2; NCT01958021), a phase II trial of palbociclib plus letrozole (PALOMA-1; NCT00721409), and a Bayesian network meta-analysis. Health care costs included drug acquisition and monitoring, disease management, subsequent therapies, and serious drug-related adverse events. Effectiveness was measured in life-years, derived from survival projections, and in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), calculated from time spent in each state combined with health-state utility values. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis explored the impact of uncertainty in key model parameters on results, and probabilistic uncertainty was assessed through a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Ribociclib plus letrozole was dominant versus palbociclib plus letrozole, with a cost saving of $43,037 and a gain of 0.086 QALYs. Compared with letrozole monotherapy, ribociclib plus letrozole was associated with an incremental cost of $144,915 and an incremental QALY of 0.689, equating to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $210,369 per QALY. Key model drivers included OS HRs for palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole and for ribociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole, the PFS HR for palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole, PD health-state costs, utility of response, and cost discount rate. The probabilities that ribociclib plus letrozole was cost-effective versus letrozole at thresholds of $50,000, $100,000 and $200,000 per QALY gained were 1.6%, 6.3%, and 50.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, ribociclib plus letrozole is a cost-effective alternative to palbociclib plus letrozole for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Ribociclib plus letrozole is also cost-effective versus letrozole monotherapy at willingness-to-pay thresholds greater than $198,000 per QALY (for probabilistic analysis).

19584,Cost-Effectiveness of Ribociclib plus Letrozole Versus Palbociclib plus Letrozole and Letrozole Monotherapy in the First-Line Treatment of Postmenopausal Women with HR+/HER2- Advanced or Metastatic Breast Cancer: A U.S. Payer Perspective,"BACKGROUND: U.S. regulatory approvals of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK 4/6) inhibitors ribociclib and palbociclib as add-ons to letrozole greatly enhance the prospects for treating postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal receptor 2-negative (HER2-) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Clinical trials have established that the combination of a CDK 4/6 inhibitor with letrozole can significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) versus letrozole monotherapy and is safe and well tolerated. Cost-effectiveness studies are required to inform payers and clinical decision makers on the money value of combination treatment in clinical practice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ribociclib plus letrozole versus palbociclib plus letrozole and versus letrozole monotherapy in the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer from a U.S. private third-party payer perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival model including 3 health states (progression free, with either overall response or stable disease; progressed disease; and death) simulated lifetime costs and outcomes over a 40-year lifetime horizon with a 1-month cycle length. Clinical efficacy data (PFS and overall survival [OS]) were derived from a phase III trial of ribociclib plus letrozole (MONALEESA-2; NCT01958021), a phase II trial of palbociclib plus letrozole (PALOMA-1; NCT00721409), and a Bayesian network meta-analysis. Health care costs included drug acquisition and monitoring, disease management, subsequent therapies, and serious drug-related adverse events. Effectiveness was measured in life-years, derived from survival projections, and in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), calculated from time spent in each state combined with health-state utility values. A one-way deterministic sensitivity analysis explored the impact of uncertainty in key model parameters on results, and probabilistic uncertainty was assessed through a Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Ribociclib plus letrozole was dominant versus palbociclib plus letrozole, with a cost saving of $43,037 and a gain of 0.086 QALYs. Compared with letrozole monotherapy, ribociclib plus letrozole was associated with an incremental cost of $144,915 and an incremental QALY of 0.689, equating to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $210,369 per QALY. Key model drivers included OS HRs for palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole and for ribociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole, the PFS HR for palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole, PD health-state costs, utility of response, and cost discount rate. The probabilities that ribociclib plus letrozole was cost-effective versus letrozole at thresholds of $50,000, $100,000 and $200,000 per QALY gained were 1.6%, 6.3%, and 50.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, ribociclib plus letrozole is a cost-effective alternative to palbociclib plus letrozole for the first-line treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer. Ribociclib plus letrozole is also cost-effective versus letrozole monotherapy at willingness-to-pay thresholds greater than $198,000 per QALY (for probabilistic analysis).

BACKGROUND: For survivors of myocardial infarction with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks despite antiarrhythmic drugs, the VANISH (Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation Versus Escalated Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy in Ischemic Heart Disease) trial demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with catheter ablation compared with more aggressive antiarrhythmic pharmacotherapy. METHODS: Health care resource use and quality-of-life data were used to determine the cost effectiveness of catheter ablation. Published references were used to estimate costs (in 2015 Canadian dollars). The analysis was over 3 years, with a 5% discount rate. Adjustment was made for censoring and baseline utilities. RESULTS: Ablation resulted in greater quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than escalated drug therapy did (1.63 vs. 1.49; difference: 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.20 to 0.46) and higher cost ($65,126 vs. $60,269; difference: $4,857; 95% CI: -$19,757 to $27,106); with an incremental cost per QALY gained for ablation versus escalated drug therapy of $34,057 primarily due to the initial costs of ablation, which were partially offset by the costs of subsequent ablations and adverse outcomes in the escalated drug therapy arm. For patients with amiodarone-refractory ventricular tachycardia, ablation dominated escalated drug therapy, with greater QALYs (1.48 vs. 1.26; difference: 0.22; 95% CI: -0.19 to 0.59) and lower costs ($67,614 vs. $68,383; difference: -$769; 95% CI: -$35,330 to $27,092). For those with sotalol-refractory ventricular tachycardia, ablation resulted in similar QALYs (1.90 vs. 1.90; difference: -0.00; 95% CI: -0.59 to 0.62) and higher costs ($60,455 vs. $45,033; difference: $15,422; 95% CI: -$10,968 to $48,555).

19588,Cost-effectiveness of using kidneys from hepatitis C nucleic acid test-positive donors for transplantation in hepatitis C-negative recipients,"Kidneys from deceased donors who are hepatitis C virus (HCV) nucleic acid test positive are infrequently used for transplantation in HCV-negative patients due to concerns about disease transmission. With the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV, there is now potential to use these kidneys in HCV-negative candidates. However, the high cost of DAAs poses a challenge to adoption of this strategy. We created a Markov model to examine the cost-effectiveness of using deceased donors infected with HCV for kidney transplantation in uninfected waitlist candidates. In the primary analysis, this strategy was cost saving and improved health outcomes compared to remaining on the waitlist for an additional 2 or more years to receive a HCV-negative transplant. The strategy was also cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $56 018 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from the payer perspective, and $4647 per QALY from the societal perspective, compared to remaining on the waitlist for 1 additional year. The results were consistent in 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

METHODS: A Microsoft Excel model was used to evaluate the cost-utility of IDegLira versus BBT over a 1-year time horizon. Clinical input data were taken from the treat-to-target DUAL VII trial, conducted in patients unable to achieve adequate glycaemic control (HbA1c <7.0%) with basal insulin, with IDegLira associated with lower rates of hypoglycaemia and reduced body mass index (BMI) in comparison with BBT, with similar HbA1c reductions. Costs (expressed in GBP) and event-related disutilities were taken from published sources. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with an improvement of 0.05 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) versus BBT, due to reductions in non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes and BMI with IDegLira. Costs were higher with IDegLira by GBP 303 per patient, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of GBP 5924 per QALY gained for IDegLira versus BBT. ICERs remained below GBP 20 000 per QALY gained across a range of sensitivity analyses.

PERSPECTIVE AND SETTING: The study took the perspective and setting of the UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: The model structure was a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Separate analyses based on the number of prior csDMARDs (one and two or more) were conducted, with secukinumab 150 mg compared to standard of care (SoC) and TNFis, respectively, for each subpopulation. Clinical parameters, including response at 3 months, were from the FUTURE 2 trial and a network meta-analysis. Outcomes included total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the 40-year time horizon (3.5% annual discount for both outcomes; cost year 2017), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: The ICER for secukinumab 150 mg versus SoC was pound28,748 per QALY gained (one prior csDMARD).

PERSPECTIVE AND SETTING: The study took the perspective and setting of the UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: The model structure was a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Separate analyses based on the number of prior csDMARDs (one and two or more) were conducted, with secukinumab 150 mg compared to standard of care (SoC) and TNFis, respectively, for each subpopulation. Clinical parameters, including response at 3 months, were from the FUTURE 2 trial and a network meta-analysis. Outcomes included total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the 40-year time horizon (3.5% annual discount for both outcomes; cost year 2017), and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: The ICER for secukinumab 150 mg versus SoC was pound28,748 per QALY gained (one prior csDMARD). Secukinumab 150 mg dominated golimumab, certolizumab pegol and etanercept, and had an ICER of pound5680 per QALY gained versus adalimumab and > pound1 million saved per QALY foregone versus infliximab (two or more prior csDMARDs). Valuing one QALY at between pound20,000 and pound30,000, the probability of secukinumab having the highest net monetary benefit was 48.9% (one prior csDMARD) and 88.9% (two or more prior csDMARDs).

PERSPECTIVE AND SETTING: UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: The model was structured as a 3-month decision tree leading into a Markov model. Comparators were licensed tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (including available biosimilars) and CC in the biologic-naive and biologic-experienced populations, respectively. Clinical parameters captured treatment response, short-term disease activity and patient functioning, as well as long-term structural disease progression. Utilities were derived from secukinumab trial data. List prices were used for all drugs. The cost year was 2017 and costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: In the biologic-naive population, secukinumab dominated adalimumab and certolizumab pegol. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) versus other comparators were either below pound10,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained or south-west ICERs that implied cost effectiveness of secukinumab.
