7001,Cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in germany: Model analysis from the perspective of germany's statutory health insurance system,"Background: In clinical trials, ranibizumab has been associated with stabilization and even improvement of visual acuity among patients with neovascular agerelated macular degeneration (AMD), but its use is also associated with considerable costs. Objective: The aim of this work was to compare ranibizumab with best supportive care or photodynamic therapy (PDT) for AMD by means of economic costutility and cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of Germany's Statutory Health Insurance System. Methods: Visual acuity data from the Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic Choroidal Neovascularization in AMD (ANCHOR) and Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-VEGF Antibody Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Neovascular AMD (MARINA) studies were applied, based on a ranibizumab dose of 0.5 mg. A Markov model simulated visual acuity and costs over 10 years (discounted at 3%). The base-case analysis assumed 5 injections per year over 2 years. Treatment costs were based on year-2008 euros (using German prices) and recommendations for procedure reimbursement from a public health insurance perspective. To assess cost-effectiveness, costs per year of legal blindness avoided (ie, vision-year gained [VYG]) and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were calculated. The model assumed each patient's affected eye had better sight than the other eye, and the 2 comparators against which ranibizumab treatment was assessed were best supportive care and PDT. The robustness of the results was investigated in a univariate sensitivity analysis of all relevant parameters and a multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The multivariate 95% CIs for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were obtained by conducting 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Compared with best supportive care, costs per VYG for ranibizumab were euro6767 in occult choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and euro6020 in minimally classic CNV. In classic CNV, costs were euro5734/VYG for ranibizumab compared with supportive care and euro778/VYG for ranibizumab compared with PDT. Costs per QALY for ranibizumab treatment for occult, minimally classic CNV, and classic CNV were euro22,320, euro22,538, and euro25,036, respectively, and euro3294 for classic CNV compared with PDT. Results were sensitive to the cost of blindness, injection frequency, and duration. The multivariate 95% CIs for the incremental costeffectiveness ratios were euro14,438 to euro41,110/QALY for occult CNV, euro13,463 to euro43,614/QALY for minimally classic CNV, and euro15,634 to euro51,106/QALY for classic CNV.

7003,A cost-effectiveness analysis of coagulation testing prior to tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy in children,"BACKGROUND: The American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology recommends pre-operative coagulation testing only when indicated by history or physical exam. Nevertheless, many surgeons test all children scheduled for tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy (T&A). Studies of pre-operative screening have had conflicting results. A decision analysis model was constructed to address the costs and health outcome states of pre-operative screening strategies in children. PROCEDURE: A 14-day Markov model evaluated three strategies: (1) test all children for coagulation disorders; (2) test only those children with a pertinent history; and (3) perform no pre-operative testing. A literature search and a review of national databases estimated probabilities, costs, and utility data. Parameters then were varied widely in sensitivity analyses. Using a societal perspective and a cycle length of 1 day, we compared the strategies based on total costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Total costs for the strategies were $3,200 for testing all children, $3,083 for testing only those with a history finding, and $3,077 for not testing. Total utilities were 0.02579, 0.02654, and 0.02659 QALYs, respectively. Cost-effectiveness ratios were most sensitive to variation in the cost of post-operative care and the probability of post-operative bleeding. The strategy of not testing was dominant in all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that not performing preoperative testing is the most cost-effective strategy. This was persistent in sensitivity analyses, indicating that the model was robust. These data may be helpful to institutions and organizations to formulate policies regarding pre-operative coagulation for children without previous diagnoses of bleeding disorders.

7005,Cost-Effectiveness Model of Empiric Doripenem Compared with Imipenem-Cilastatin in Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia,"Abstract Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication of critical illness among surgical and trauma patients. Inappropriate empiric treatment of VAP increases the mortality rate. The rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) VAP susceptibility to doripenem (DOR) are higher than those to imipenem-cilastatin (IMI). We developed a model to quantify outcome differences between strategies of empiric treatment of VAP with DOR vs. IMI. Methods: We designed a cost-effectiveness model comparing empiric treatment of VAP with DOR vs. IMI from both the hospital and societal perspectives. We examined the differences in the number of deaths, hospital length of stay (LOS), total costs, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) under each scenario and conducted Monte Carlo simulations and sensitivity analyses to determine the stability of our estimates. Drug costs were taken as 80% of wholesale acquisition costs, with other inputs derived from the literature. Results: In the base case analysis, assuming a PA-VAP attributable mortality rate of 38.4% and a 49% relative risk reduction in deaths in PA-sensitive (PA-S) infections to empiric drug compared with a resistant PA (PA-R) organism, DOR use resulted in three additional deaths avoided, 117.4 days of hospitalization averted, and hospital savings of $422,524 per 1,000 patients treated at a cost of $5,748/QALY. All estimates were most sensitive to the costs of treating PA-S and PA-R infections. In a multivariable analysis, hospital cost savings persisted across >80% of the simulations (95% confidence interval $432,615-$2,148,540). Conclusions: Given the current microbiologic sensitivity profile of PA to DOR and IMI, and depending on the local susceptibility patterns and in institutions where DOR in vitro susceptibilities are superior to those of other carbapenems for PA clinical isolates, empiric treatment of VAP with DOR may dominate that with IMI by being both life- and cost-saving.",2010-01-06540,20666580,Surg Infect (Larchmt),Marya D Zilberberg,2010,/,,No,20666580,"Marya D Zilberberg; Cost-Effectiveness Model of Empiric Doripenem Compared with Imipenem-Cilastatin in Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia, Surg Infect (Larchmt), 2010-Jul-28; ():1557-8674",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Imipenem-cilastatin (IMI) vs. Doripenem (DOR),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,5748,United States,2008,6909.54
7006,Comparative Effectiveness of ST-Segment-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Regionalization Strategies,"Background Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is more effective on average than fibrinolytic therapy in the treatment of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. Yet, most US hospitals are not equipped for PCI, and fibrinolytic therapy is still widely used. This study evaluated the comparative effectiveness of ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction regionalization strategies to increase the use of PCI against standard emergency transport and care. Methods and Results We estimated incremental treatment costs and quality-adjusted life expectancies of 2000 patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction who received PCI or fibrinolytic therapy in simulations of emergency care in a regional hospital system. To increase access to PCI across the system, we compared a base case strategy with 12 hospital-based strategies of building new PCI laboratories or extending the hours of existing laboratories and 1 emergency medical services-based strategy of transporting all patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction to existing PCI-capable hospitals. The base case resulted in 609 (95% CI, 569-647) patients getting PCI. Hospital-based strategies increased the number of patients receiving PCI, the costs of care, and quality-adjusted life years saved and were cost-effective under a variety of conditions. An emergency medical services-based strategy of transporting every patient to an existing PCI facility was less costly and more effective than all hospital expansion options.

7020,Cost effectiveness of rosuvastatin in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease based on findings from the JUPITER trial,"Abstract Objective: This study assessed the long-term cost effectiveness of rosuvastatin therapy compared with placebo in reducing the incidence of major cardiovascular (CVD) events and mortality. Methods: A probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation model estimated long-term cost effectiveness of rosuvastatin therapy (20 mg daily) for the prevention of CVD mortality and morbidity. The model included three stages: (1) CVD prevention simulating the 4 years of the JUPITER trial, (2) initial CVD prevention beyond the trial, and (3) subsequent CVD event prevention. A US payer perspective was assessed reflecting direct medical costs, and up to a lifetime horizon. Sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the model estimates. Results: For a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 patients at moderate and high risk of CVD events based on Framingham risk of >/=10%, estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with rosuvastatin therapy compared with placebo was 33,480 over a lifetime horizon, and 25,380 and 9916 over 20-year and 10-year horizons, respectively. Approximately 12,073 events were avoided over the lifetime; 6,146 non-fatal MIs, 2905 non-fatal strokes, and 4030 CVD deaths avoided. Estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for cost per QALY was $7062 (lifetime), $10,743 (20-year horizon), and $44,466 (10-year horizon). For a hypothetical cohort similar to the overall JUPITER population, the cost per QALY ICER was $11,025 for the lifetime and $60,112 for a 10-year horizon. Limitations: The cost-effectiveness comparison of rosuvastatin 20 mg was against no active treatment (as opposed to an alternative statin) due to lack of comparative cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk reduction data for other statins in a population similar to the JUPITER trial population. The analysis was conducted from the payer perspective and lack of inclusion of indirect costs limit interpretability of results from a societal perspective. Conclusions: Treatment with rosuvastatin 20 mg daily, is a cost-effective treatment alternative to no treatment in patients at a higher risk (Framingham risk >/=10%) of CVD.",2010-01-06542,20662625,J Med Econ,Robert L Ohsfeldt,2010,/,,Yes,20662625,"Robert L Ohsfeldt; Cost effectiveness of rosuvastatin in patients at risk of cardiovascular disease based on findings from the JUPITER trial, J Med Econ, 2010-Jul-21; ():1369-6998",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rosuvastatin 20 mg per day vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,7062,United States,2009,8519.38

To estimate the cost-effectiveness of etanercept (ETN) plus usual care (including NSAIDs) compared with usual care alone (including NSAIDs) in patients with severe AS in Germany. Methods. A mathematical model previously applied to the UK was adapted using resource use and cost data (for 2007) from the national database of the German Collaborative Arthritis Centres. Social health insurance (SHI) and societal perspectives were analysed. Assumptions on initial response and changes in health-related quality of life were based on Phase III randomized controlled trials. Initial treatment response according to British Society for Rheumatology guidelines were assumed as a conservative estimate in the German context. Long-term disease progression was based on the available literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were expressed as euros/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), for a cohort of 1000 patients over 25 years. Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in results. Results. In the base case, ETN plus usual care (including NSAIDs) yielded 1475 more QALYs at an additional cost of euro80 827 668 (SHI) or euro32 657 590 (societal) leading to an ICER of euro54 815/QALY and euro22 147/QALY, respectively. Over a shorter time horizon of 10 years, the ICERs were euro59 006 and euro29 815 for SHI and societal viewpoints, respectively. Assumptions having the largest impact on results included withdrawal rates from ETN, quality of life, disease costs and initial response. Conclusions.

STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model was developed to simulate weight loss, health consequences, and costs for surgical treatment of morbid obesity. The model was used to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. METHODS: Estimates of procedure effectiveness were derived from published results of a head-to-head randomized controlled trial. Other model parameters, including complication rates, costs of treatment, adverse events and obesity, mortality rates, and utilities, were estimated from published literature and publicly available databases. Costs (2006 US dollars) and QALYs were discounted by 3% per annum. RESULTS: Under conservative assumptions, both LAGB and LRYGB improved health outcomes, at a higher cost, compared with no treatment. ICERs for both LAGB and LRYGB versus no treatment were below $25,000 per QALY gained. ICERs were lower for individuals with higher initial body mass index and higher for older individuals. ICERs for men were generally higher than those of women. Sensitivity analyses showed these results to be robust to reasonable variation in model parameters and overall parameter uncertainty. Base-case ICERs for LRYGB versus LAGB were below $25,000 per QALY gained, but were highly sensitive to model assumptions.

Costs (2006 US dollars) and QALYs were discounted by 3% per annum. RESULTS: Under conservative assumptions, both LAGB and LRYGB improved health outcomes, at a higher cost, compared with no treatment. ICERs for both LAGB and LRYGB versus no treatment were below $25,000 per QALY gained. ICERs were lower for individuals with higher initial body mass index and higher for older individuals. ICERs for men were generally higher than those of women. Sensitivity analyses showed these results to be robust to reasonable variation in model parameters and overall parameter uncertainty. Base-case ICERs for LRYGB versus LAGB were below $25,000 per QALY gained, but were highly sensitive to model assumptions.

The model was used to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. METHODS: Estimates of procedure effectiveness were derived from published results of a head-to-head randomized controlled trial. Other model parameters, including complication rates, costs of treatment, adverse events and obesity, mortality rates, and utilities, were estimated from published literature and publicly available databases. Costs (2006 US dollars) and QALYs were discounted by 3% per annum. RESULTS: Under conservative assumptions, both LAGB and LRYGB improved health outcomes, at a higher cost, compared with no treatment. ICERs for both LAGB and LRYGB versus no treatment were below $25,000 per QALY gained. ICERs were lower for individuals with higher initial body mass index and higher for older individuals. ICERs for men were generally higher than those of women. Sensitivity analyses showed these results to be robust to reasonable variation in model parameters and overall parameter uncertainty. Base-case ICERs for LRYGB versus LAGB were below $25,000 per QALY gained, but were highly sensitive to model assumptions.

7044,Screening cardiac surgery patients for MRSA: an economic computer model,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the economic value of preoperative methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening and decolonization for cardiac surgery patients. STUDY DESIGN: Monte Carlo decision-analytic computer simulation model. METHODS: We developed a computer simulation model representing the decision of whether to perform preoperative MRSA screening and decolonizing those patients with a positive MRSA culture. Sensitivity analyses varied key input parameters including MRSA colonization prevalence, decolonization success rates, the number of surveillance sites, and screening/decolonization costs. Separate analyses estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the screening and decolonization strategy from the third-party payer and hospital perspectives. RESULTS: Even when MRSA colonization prevalence and decolonization success rate were as low as 1% and 25%, respectively, the ICER of implementing routine surveillance was well under $15,000 per quality-adjusted life-year from both the third-party payer and hospital perspectives. The surveillance strategy was economically dominant (less costly and more effective than no testing) for most scenarios explored. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that routine preoperative MRSA screening of cardiac surgery patients could provide substantial economic value to third-party payers and hospitals over a wide range of MRSA colonization prevalence levels, decolonization success rates, and surveillance costs.

7046,Comparative effectiveness of screening and prevention strategies among BRCA1/2-affected mutation carriers,"Comparative effectiveness research has become an integral part of health care planning in most developed countries. In a simulated cohort of women, aged 30-65, who tested positive for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, we compared outcomes of mammography with and without MRI, prophylactic oophorectomy with and without mastectomy, mastectomy alone, and chemoprevention. Methods: Using Treeage 9.02 software, we developed Markov models with 25,000 Monte Carlo simulations and conducted probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We based mutation penetrance rates, breast and ovarian cancer incidence, and mortality rates, and costs in terms of 2009 dollars, on published studies and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We used preference ratings obtained from mutation carriers and controls to adjust survival for quality of life (QALYs). Results: For BRCA1 mutation carriers, prophylactic oophorectomy at $1,741 per QALY, was more cost effective than both surgeries and dominated all other interventions. For BRCA2 carriers, prophylactic oophorectomy, at $4,587 per QALY, was more cost effective than both surgeries. Without quality adjustment, both mastectomy and BSO surgeries dominated all other interventions. In all simulations, preventive surgeries or chemoprevention dominated or were more cost effective than screening because screening modalities were costly. Conclusion: Our analysis suggested that among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, prophylactic surgery would dominate or be cost effective compared to chemoprevention and screening.

Its benefits for other causes of non-traumatic brain swelling, if any, are unclear, especially after a devastating primary event. Methods: We evaluated the outcomes as well as treatment costs of all emergency decompressive craniectomies performed between the 2000 and 2006 in a single institution to lower intractable intracranial pressure, excluding the standard indications TBI and malignant middle cerebral infarction. The health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was evaluated on the Euroqol (EQ-5D) scale, and cost of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) calculated.

7051,A cost-utility and budget impact analysis of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for severe thalassemic patients in Thailand,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative treatment available to severe thalassemic patients. The treatment, however, is very costly, particularly in the context of low and middle income countries, and no studies have been carried out to explore its economic justifiability. This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of HSCT compared with blood transfusions combined with iron chelating therapy (BT-ICT) for severe thalassemia in Thailand, and to investigate the affordability of HSCT using a budget impact analysis. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes over the patients' lifetimes taking a societal perspective as recommended by Thailand's health technology assessment guidelines. All future costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3% per annum. Primary outcomes of interest were lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in Thai baht (THB) per QALY gained. RESULTS: Compared to BT-ICT, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increased with patient age from 80,700 to 183,000 THB per QALY gained for related HSCT and 209,000 to 953,000 THB per QALY gained for unrelated HSCT among patients aged 1 to 15 years (US$1= 34 THB). The governmental budget impact analysis showed that providing 200 related HSCT to patients aged 1 to 10 years, in accordance with the current infrastructure limitations, would initially require approximately 90 million additional THB per year.

Design: Analysis was carried out using a probabilistic Markov model with trabectedin --> EST and EST arms, three health states (stable disease, progressive disease and death) and a lifetime perspective (3% annual discount rate). Finnish resources (drugs, mSTS, adverse events and travelling) and costs (year 2008) were used. Efficacy was based on an indirect comparison of the STS-201 and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer trials. QLQ-C30 scale scores were mapped to 15D, Short Form 6D and EuroQol 5D utilities. The outcome measures were the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier, incremental cost per life year gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and the expected value of perfect information (EVPI). RESULTS: Trabectedin --> EST was associated with 14.0 (95% confidence interval 9.1-19.2) months longer survival, euro36 778 higher costs (euro32 816 using hospital price for trabectedin) and euro31 590 (euro28 192) incremental cost per LYG with an EVPI of euro3008 (euro3188) compared with EST. With a threshold of euro50 000 per LYG, trabectedin --> EST had 98.5% (98.2%) probability of being cost-effective. The incremental cost per QALY gained with trabectedin --> EST was euro42 633-47 735 (euro37 992-42 819) compared with EST. The results were relatively insensitive to changes.

Design: Economic evaluation of a clinical trial conducted at six community out-patient treatment programs from July 2003 to December 2006, who were randomized to 12 weeks of BUP or a 14-day taper (DETOX). BUP patients were prescribed up to 24 mg per day for 9 weeks and then tapered to zero at the end of week 12. DETOX patients were prescribed up to 14 mg per day and then tapered to zero on day 14. All were offered twice-weekly drug counseling. Participants: 152 patients aged 15-21 years. Measurements: Data were collected prospectively during the 12-week treatment and at follow-up interviews at months 6, 9 and 12. Findings: The 12-week out-patient study treatment cost was $1514 (P < 0.001) higher for BUP relative to DETOX. One-year total direct medical cost was only $83 higher for BUP (P = 0.97).

7056,Economic evaluation of toric intraocular lens: a short- and long-term decision analytic model,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the economic value of improved uncorrected visual acuity among patients with cataract and preexisting astigmatism treated with toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) compared with conventional monofocal IOLs. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model of hypothetical patients with preexisting astigmatism. We examined costs and outcomes among patients 65 years and older with cataract and preexisting astigmatism (1.5-3.0 diopters) who were receiving either toric or conventional IOLs with and without intraoperative refractive correction (IRC). Data were obtained from the literature and from a survey of 60 US ophthalmologists. Total medical costs of bilateral treatment were calculated for the first posttreatment year and remaining lifetime. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility outcomes were computed. Future costs and utilities were discounted by 3%. RESULTS: A larger proportion of patients receiving toric IOLs achieved distance vision spectacle independence (67%) and uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better OU (53%) compared with conventional IOLs with (63% and 48%, respectively) or without IRC (53% and 44%, respectively), resulting in fewer future vision corrections. Toric IOLs provided an additional 10.20 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with conventional IOLs with (10.14 QALYs) and without IRC (10.10 QALYs). Higher first-year costs of the toric IOL ($5739) compared with the conventional IOL with ($5635) or without ($4687) IRC were offset by lifetime cost savings of $34 per patient, $393 per patient achieving uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better, and $349 per QALY compared with the conventional IOL without IRC.

7058,The cost-effectiveness of screening for colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Published decision analyses show that screening for colorectal cancer is cost-effective. However, because of the number of tests available, the optimal screening strategy in Canada is unknown. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of 10 strategies for colorectal cancer screening, as well as no screening, incorporating quality of life, noncompliance and data on the costs and benefits of chemotherapy. METHODS: We used a probabilistic Markov model to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 50-year-old average-risk Canadians without screening and with screening by each test. We populated the model with data from the published literature. We calculated costs from the perspective of a third-party payer, with inflation to 2007 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: Of the 10 strategies considered, we focused on three tests currently being used for population screening in some Canadian provinces: low-sensitivity guaiac fecal occult blood test, performed annually; fecal immunochemical test, performed annually; and colonoscopy, performed every 10 years. These strategies reduced the incidence of colorectal cancer by 44%, 65% and 81%, and mortality by 55%, 74% and 83%, respectively, compared with no screening. These strategies generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $9159, $611 and $6133 per quality-adjusted life year, respectively. The findings were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Colonoscopy every 10 years yielded the greatest net health benefit. INTERPRETATION: Screening for colorectal cancer is cost-effective over conventional levels of willingness to pay.

7061,Cost-effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination alongside cervical cancer screening programme in Slovenia,"BACKGROUND: The objective of the present study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination alongside cervical cancer screening programme in Slovenia. METHODS: A previously published Markov model representing natural history of HPV infection was adapted to Slovenian context. The model followed a cohort of 12-year-old girls to 85-year-old women. Two strategies were compared: HPV vaccination alongside conventional cytological screening versus screening alone. Analysis was performed from the health care payer perspective. RESULTS: Vaccination with screening compared with screening alone was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 23,178 EUR per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and 54,536 EUR per life-year gained (LYG) at the discounting rate of 5%. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICER was most sensitive to the need for booster dose and to different values of discount rates. In case the booster dose was assumed 10 years after initial vaccination, the ICER value was increased to 58,690 EUR per QALY. On the other hand, using lower values of discount rates than the base case 5% significantly reduced the ICER value. CONCLUSION: According to the cost-effectiveness thresholds of 30,000 EUR per QALY which was adopted by the Health Council in Slovenia, HPV vaccination alongside screening programme can be regarded as cost-effective. However, cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination would become questionable in case a booster dose was needed to provide lifetime protection.",2010-01-06577,20624834,Eur J Public Health,Marko Obradovic,2010,20 / 4,415-21,No,20624834,"Marko Obradovic; Cost-effectiveness analysis of HPV vaccination alongside cervical cancer screening programme in Slovenia, Eur J Public Health, 2010-Aug; 20(4):1101-1262; 415-21",QALY,Slovenia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination with current cervical cancer screening program vs. Current cervical cancer screening program,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,23178,Euro,2008,41028.12

However, few studies have investigated the cost effectiveness of maintenance treatment options for BPD I. To determine the cost effectiveness of maintenance treatment with quetiapine fumarate extended-release (XR) tablets in combination with mood stabilizers (lithium or divalproex) in comparison with the following treatments: placebo in combination with lithium or divalproex; no maintenance treatment; lithium monotherapy; lamotrigine monotherapy; olanzapine monotherapy; and aripiprazole monotherapy. The analysis was conducted from the societal and payer perspectives in the US, using a Markov model. The model simulated a cohort of 1000 stabilized BPD I patients and estimated the quarterly risk in three health states: euthymia, mania and depression. Efficacy data were derived from two randomized, double-blind trials comparing quetiapine + lithium/divalproex with placebo + lithium/divalproex for up to 2 years, as well as other published literature. Resource data were extracted from published literature. Drug costs, hospitalizations and physician visits were among the direct costs. Indirect costs included absenteeism, and mortality rates included suicide. Benefits and costs were discounted at 3% and the price reference year was 2009. Endpoints included number of acute mood episodes, hospitalizations due to an acute mood event and costs per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to evaluate uncertainty in the model inputs. Treatment with quetiapine XR + lithium/divalproex was associated with reductions in acute mania (46%), acute depression (41%) and related hospitalizations (44%) compared with placebo + lithium/divalproex, and similar reductions in events were observed relative to lithium monotherapy. In the base-case analysis from the payer perspective, the discounted incremental cost per QALY for quetiapine XR + lithium/divalproex compared with placebo + lithium/divalproex was $US22 959, and compared with lithium monotherapy was $US100 235, while all other comparators were dominated.

However, few studies have investigated the cost effectiveness of maintenance treatment options for BPD I. To determine the cost effectiveness of maintenance treatment with quetiapine fumarate extended-release (XR) tablets in combination with mood stabilizers (lithium or divalproex) in comparison with the following treatments: placebo in combination with lithium or divalproex; no maintenance treatment; lithium monotherapy; lamotrigine monotherapy; olanzapine monotherapy; and aripiprazole monotherapy. The analysis was conducted from the societal and payer perspectives in the US, using a Markov model. The model simulated a cohort of 1000 stabilized BPD I patients and estimated the quarterly risk in three health states: euthymia, mania and depression. Efficacy data were derived from two randomized, double-blind trials comparing quetiapine + lithium/divalproex with placebo + lithium/divalproex for up to 2 years, as well as other published literature. Resource data were extracted from published literature. Drug costs, hospitalizations and physician visits were among the direct costs. Indirect costs included absenteeism, and mortality rates included suicide. Benefits and costs were discounted at 3% and the price reference year was 2009. Endpoints included number of acute mood episodes, hospitalizations due to an acute mood event and costs per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to evaluate uncertainty in the model inputs. Treatment with quetiapine XR + lithium/divalproex was associated with reductions in acute mania (46%), acute depression (41%) and related hospitalizations (44%) compared with placebo + lithium/divalproex, and similar reductions in events were observed relative to lithium monotherapy.

7068,The value of trauma center care,"BACKGROUND: The cost of trauma center care is high, raising questions about the value of a regionalized approach to trauma care. To address these concerns, we estimate 1-year and lifetime treatment costs and measure the cost-effectiveness of treatment at a Level I trauma center (TC) compared with a nontrauma center hospital (NTC). METHODS: Estimates of cost-effectiveness were derived using data on 5,043 major trauma patients enrolled in the National Study on Costs and Outcomes of Trauma, a prospective cohort study of severely injured adult patients cared for in 69 hospitals in 14 states. Data on costs were derived from multiple sources including claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, UB92 hospital bills, and patient interviews. Cost-effectiveness was estimated as the ratio of the difference in costs (for treatment at a TC vs. NTC) divided by the difference in life years gained (and lives saved). We also measured cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year gained where quality of life was measured using the SF-6D. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for observable differences between patients treated at TCs and NTCs. RESULTS: The added cost for treatment at a TC versus NTC was $36,319 per life-year gained ($790,931 per life saved) and $36,961 per quality-adjusted life years gained. Cost-effectiveness was more favorable for patients with injuries of higher versus lower severity and for younger versus older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that regionalization of trauma care is not only effective but also it is cost-effective.",2010-01-06580,20622572,J Trauma,Ellen J Mackenzie,2010,69 / 1,1-10,No,20622572,"Ellen J Mackenzie; The value of trauma center care, J Trauma, 2010-Jul; 69(1):0022-5282; 1-10",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment at a Level I trauma center (TC) vs. Treatment at nontrauma center hospitla (NTC),Not Stated,84 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,36961,United States,2005,48980.61
7069,The cost effectiveness of radon mitigation in existing German dwellings - A decision theoretic analysis,"Radon is a naturally occurring inert radioactive gas found in soils and rocks that can accumulate in dwellings, and is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. This study aims to analyze the cost effectiveness of different intervention strategies to reduce radon concentrations in existing German dwellings. The cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) was conducted as a scenario analysis, where each scenario represents a specific regulatory regime. A decision theoretic model was developed, which reflects accepted recommendations for radon screening and mitigation and uses most up-to-date data on radon distribution and relative risks. The model was programmed to account for compliance with respect to the single steps of radon intervention, as well as data on the sensitivity/specificity of radon tests. A societal perspective was adopted to calculate costs and effects. All scenarios were calculated for different action levels. Cost effectiveness was measured in costs per averted case of lung cancer, costs per life year gained and costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Univariate and multivariate deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were based on Monte Carlo simulations with 5000 model runs. The results show that legal regulations with mandatory screening and mitigation for indoor radon levels >100 Bq/m(3) are most cost effective. Incremental cost effectiveness compared to the no mitigation base case is 25,181 euro (95% CI: 7371 euro-90,593 euro) per QALY gained. Other intervention strategies focussing primarily on the personal responsibility for screening and/or mitigative actions show considerably worse cost effectiveness ratios. However, targeting radon intervention to radon-prone areas is significantly more cost effective. Most of the uncertainty that surrounds the results can be ascribed to the relative risk of radon exposure.

Methods: A Markov model of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women was developed using 6-month cycles and a lifetime horizon. The model was populated with patients similar to the Swedish cohort of the European Forsteo Observational Study (postmenopausal women; mean age: 70 years, total hip T-score: -2.7 and 3.3 previous fractures). The cost effectiveness of both teriparatide and PTH(1-84) was estimated compared to no treatment and each other. Relative effectiveness assumptions were based on efficacy estimates from two phase III clinical trials. Results: The cost per QALY gained of teriparatide vs. no treatment was estimated at euro43,473 and PTH(1-84) was estimated at euro104,396. Teriparatide was indicated to be less costly and associated with more life-years and QALYs than PTH(1-84). When assuming no treatment effect on hip fractures the cost per QALY gained was euro88,379. In the sensitivity analysis the cost effectiveness did not alter substantially with changes in the majority of the model parameters except for the residual effect of the treatment after stopping therapy. Conclusions: Based on the efficacy estimates from pivotal clinical trials and characteristics of patients treated in clinical practice in Sweden, teriparatide seems to be a more cost-effective option than PTH(1-84) when compared to no treatment.

DESIGN: Population-based study using national register data and parental questionnaires. SETTING: Finland. PARTICIPANTS: All 2064 very preterm children (gestational age <32 weeks or birth weight <1501 g) and all 200 609 full-term control individuals (mean [SD] gestational age, 37 [0] to 41 [6] weeks) born from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2003.

RESULTS: By 4 years of age, the cost per QALY for full-term controls (in 2008 currency) was euro1181 (US$1736). In very preterm children, the average cost per QALY was euro19 245 ($28 290), ranging from euro11 824 to euro54 324 ($17 381 to $79 856) and increasing with decreasing gestational age.

7090,Hospital costs and quality of life during 4 years after very preterm birth,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of gestational age and prematurity-related morbidities on hospital costs and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) during the first 4 years of life. DESIGN: Population-based study using national register data and parental questionnaires. SETTING: Finland. PARTICIPANTS: All 2064 very preterm children (gestational age <32 weeks or birth weight <1501 g) and all 200 609 full-term control individuals (mean [SD] gestational age, 37 [0] to 41 [6] weeks) born from January 1, 2000, through December 31, 2003. MAIN EXPOSURE: Prematurity. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs of hospital care and cost per QALY at 4 years of age according to gestational age and prematurity-related morbidities. RESULTS: By 4 years of age, the cost per QALY for full-term controls (in 2008 currency) was euro1181 (US$1736). In very preterm children, the average cost per QALY was euro19 245 ($28 290), ranging from euro11 824 to euro54 324 ($17 381 to $79 856) and increasing with decreasing gestational age. The cost per QALY was euro14 368 ($21 121) for those without any of the studied morbidities and euro36 110 ($53 082) for those with 2 or more morbidities. The costs of the initial hospital stay comprised 79.5% of the total 4-year hospital costs in very preterm children.

7091,Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillators in patients >or=65 years of age,"BACKGROUND: More than 80% of sudden cardiac deaths (SCDs) occur in patients >or=65 years old; the cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy in older patients remains unclear. We sought to examine the cost-effectiveness of ICD therapy in at-risk patients >or=65 years old. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to evaluate lifetime costs and benefits of ICD therapy compared with optimal medical therapy in patients >or=65 years of age with left ventricular dysfunction. Data were derived from the literature and existing clinical trials of primary prevention of SCD. Outcome measures included life years, quality-adjusted life years, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Benefits and costs of ICD therapy in older individuals varied widely by clinical-trial population. In the 5 trials considered, for patients >or=65 years of age, ICDs demonstrated a life expectancy benefit compared with control therapy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $37,031-$138,458 per quality-adjusted life year). For 75-year-old patients, the findings were qualitatively similar, although cost-effectiveness was reduced in all trial populations. In sensitivity analyses, cost-effectiveness of ICD therapy in older individuals depended upon the trial population, quality of life, device cost, and frequency of generator replacement. Sensitivity analyses on other variables did not change the results substantially. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of ICD therapy for primary prevention in older patients varies widely among trials.
