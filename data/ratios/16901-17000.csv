16901,Simvastatin for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: long-term outcomes and cost-effectiveness from a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Simvastatin therapy for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been shown to be safe and associated with minimal adverse effects, but it does not improve clinical outcomes. The aim of this research was to report on mortality and cost-effectiveness of simvastatin in patients with ARDS at 12 months. METHODS: This was a cost-utility analysis alongside a multicentre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial carried out in the UK and Ireland. Five hundred and forty intubated and mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive once-daily simvastatin (at a dose of 80 mg) or identical placebo tablets enterally for up to 28 days. RESULTS: Mortality was lower in the simvastatin group (31.8%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 26.1-37.5) compared to the placebo group (37.3%, 95% CI 31.6-43.0) at 12 months, although this was not significant. Simvastatin was associated with statistically significant quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain (incremental QALYs 0.064, 95% CI 0.002-0.127) compared to placebo. Simvastatin was also less costly (incremental total costs - pound3601, 95% CI -8061 to 859). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY, the probability of simvastatin being cost-effective was 99%. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the results were robust to changes in methodological assumptions with the probability of cost-effectiveness never dropping below 90%. CONCLUSION: Simvastatin was found to be cost-effective for the treatment of ARDS, being associated with both a significant QALY gain and a cost saving. There was no significant reduction in mortality at 12 months, TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN, 88244364.

16902,Cost-effectiveness of pharmacist care for managing hypertension in Canada,"BACKGROUND: More than half of all heart disease and stroke are attributable to hypertension, which is associated with approximately 10% of direct medical costs globally. Clinical trial evidence has demonstrated that the benefits of pharmacist intervention, including education, consultation and/or prescribing, can help to reduce blood pressure; a recent Canadian trial found an 18.3 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure associated with pharmacist care and prescribing. The objective of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of such an intervention in a Canadian setting. METHODS: A Markov cost-effectiveness model was developed to extrapolate potential differences in long-term cardiovascular and renal disease outcomes, using Framingham risk equations and other published risk equations. A range of values for systolic blood pressure reduction was considered (7.6-18.3 mmHg) to reflect the range of potential interventions and available evidence. The model incorporated health outcomes, costs and quality of life to estimate an overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Costs considered included direct medical costs as well as the costs associated with implementing the pharmacist intervention strategy. RESULTS: For a systolic blood pressure reduction of 18.3 mmHg, the estimated impact is 0.21 fewer cardiovascular events per person and, discounted at 5% per year, 0.3 additional life-years, 0.4 additional quality-adjusted life-years and $6,364 cost savings over a lifetime. Thus, the intervention is economically dominant, being both more effective and cost-saving relative to usual care. DISCUSSION: Across a range of one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of key parameters and assumptions, pharmacist intervention remained both effective and cost-saving. CONCLUSION: Comprehensive pharmacist care of hypertension, including patient education and prescribing, has the potential to offer both health benefits and cost savings to Canadians and, as such, has important public health implications.",2017-01-23147,28507654,Can Pharm J (Ott),Carlo Marra,2017,150 / 3,184-197,No,28507654,"Carlo Marra; Karissa Johnston; Valerie Santschi; Ross T Tsuyuki; Cost-effectiveness of pharmacist care for managing hypertension in Canada, Can Pharm J (Ott), 2017 May-Jun; 150(3):1715-1635; 184-197",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full-scope pharmacist intervention (18.3 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure) vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"30 Years, 5 and 10 years",5.00,5.00,-21213.33,Canada,2015,-18137.86
16903,Cost-effectiveness of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy: a simulation modelling approach,"Objectives: In the UK, patients who require intravenous antimicrobial (IVA) treatment may receive this in the community through outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) services. Services include: IVA administration at a hospital outpatient clinic (HO); IVA administration at home by a general nurse (GN) or a specialist nurse (SN); or patient self-administered (SA) IVA administration following training. There is uncertainty regarding which OPAT services represent value for money; this study aimed to estimate their cost-effectiveness.

16906,Cost-effectiveness of non-surgical periodontal therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK,"AIM: Periodontal therapy has been shown to reduce glycated haemoglobin in patients with diabetes, although considerable uncertainty remains regarding the sustainability of such changes. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of non-surgical periodontal therapy and rigorous maintenance treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and periodontitis from a provider perspective in the UK. METHOD: Lifetime costs relating to periodontal treatment were modelled for a cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes. The projected lifetime impact of changes in glycated haemoglobin on diabetes treatment costs and quality adjusted life expectancy were estimated from a published simulation model. Costs and outcomes were combined to estimate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio for periodontal therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: The Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio was pound28,000 per Quality Adjusted Life-Year for a man aged 58 with glycated haemoglobin of 7-7.9%. The results were particularly sensitive to assumptions on the impact of periodontal therapy on glycated haemoglobin, the proportion of patients who comply with maintenance therapy and the proportion of compliant patients who respond to treatment. CONCLUSION: Assuming improvements in glycated haemoglobin can be maintained, periodontal therapy may be cost-effective for patients with type 2 diabetes at acceptable cost-per-Quality Adjusted Life-Year thresholds in the UK.

16915,Long-term clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of an 8-week multimodal knee osteoarthritis management program incorporating intra-articular sodium hyaluronate (Hyalgan(R)) injections,"BACKGROUND: Given the poor long-term effectiveness of focused nonsurgical knee osteoarthritis (OA) treatments, alternative therapies are needed for patients who have unsuccessfully exhausted nonsurgical options. METHODS: A telephone interview was conducted in patients who participated in a single 8-week multimodal knee OA treatment program (mean follow-up: 3.7 years, range: 2.7-4.9 years). The program consisted of five intra-articular knee injections of sodium hyaluronate (Hyalgan(R)), with each injection given 1 week apart, structured physical therapy, knee bracing, and patient education. Clinical outcomes included knee pain severity, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) subscores, current medication use, and history of total knee arthroplasty. Base-case, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the treatment program with comparisons made to historical literature controls undergoing usual care. RESULTS: A total of 218 patients (54%) provided long-term follow-up data. Knee pain severity decreased 60% and WOMAC subscores decreased 33%-42% compared to baseline (all p<0.001). Total knee arthroplasty was performed in 22.8% (81/356) of knees during followup. The treatment program was highly cost-effective compared to usual care with a base-case ICER of $6,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Results of subgroup analyses, one-way deterministic sensitivity analyses, and second-order probabilistic sensitivity analyses resulted in ICERs ranging from $3,996 to $10,493 per QALY. The percentage of simulations with an ICER below willingness-to-pay limits was 97.2%, 98.9%, and 99.4% for the $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY thresholds, respectively. CONCLUSION: Participation in a single 8-week knee OA treatment program, which included one cycle of five intra-articular knee injections of sodium hyaluronate given at weekly intervals, is highly cost-effective and provides clinically meaningful reductions in patient symptoms that are maintained over 3.7 years mean follow-up.",2017-01-23157,28503072,J Pain Res,Larry E Miller,2017,10 /,1045-1054,No,28503072,"Larry E Miller; Michael J Sloniewsky; Thomas E Gibbons; Janice G Johnston; Kent D Vosler; Saad Nasir; Long-term clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of an 8-week multimodal knee osteoarthritis management program incorporating intra-articular sodium hyaluronate (Hyalgan(R)) injections, J Pain Res , 2017; 10():1178-7090; 1045-1054",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Knee osteoarthritis program vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,6000,United States,2015,6551.71
16916,Cost-Effectiveness of a Bronchial Genomic Classifier for the Diagnostic Evaluation of Lung Cancer,"BACKGROUND: The use of a bronchial genomic classifier has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of bronchoscopy for suspected lung cancer by identifying patients who may be more suitable for radiographic surveillance as opposed to undergoing invasive procedures. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of bronchoscopy plus genomic classifier versus bronchoscopy alone in the diagnostic work-up of patients at intermediate risk for lung cancer. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to project the costs and effects of two competing strategies, using test performance from the AEGIS-1 and AEGIS-2 studies. Diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive and invasive follow-up, as well as associated adverse event rates were derived from published literature. Procedure costs were based on claims data and 2016 inpatient and outpatient reimbursement amounts. The model projected the number of invasive follow-up procedures, two-year costs and quality-adjusted life years, by strategy, and the resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: Use of the genomic classifier reduced invasive procedures by 28% at one month and 18% at two years, respectively. Total costs and QALY gain were similar with classifier use ($27,221 vs. $27,183, and 1.512 vs. 1.509, respectively), resulting in an ICER of $15,052 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that the use of a genomic classifier is associated with meaningful reductions in invasive procedures at about equal costs and is therefore a high-value strategy in the diagnostic work-up of patients at intermediate risk of lung cancer.",2017-01-23158,28502850,J Thorac Oncol,David Feller-Kopman,2017,/,,No,28502850,"David Feller-Kopman; Shan Liu; Benjamin P Geisler; Malcolm M DeCamp; Jan B Pietzsch; Cost-Effectiveness of a Bronchial Genomic Classifier for the Diagnostic Evaluation of Lung Cancer, J Thorac Oncol, 2017 May 09; ():1556-1380",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bronchial Genomic Classifier vs. bronchoscopy,Patients with intermediate risk for lung cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,12666.67,United States,2016,13659.07
16917,Assessing the Costs and Benefits of Insuring Psychological Services as Part of Medicare for Depression in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: The study estimated costs and effects associated with increasing access to publicly funded psychological services for depression in a public health care system. METHODS: Discrete event simulation modeled clinical events (relapse, recovery, hospitalizations, suicide attempts, and suicide), health service use, and cost outcomes over 40 years in a population with incident depression. Parameters included epidemiologic and economic data from the literature and data from a secondary analysis of the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey on mental health. Societal costs were measured with the human capital approach. Analyses estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with improved access to psychological services among individuals not receiving adequate mental health care and reporting an unmet need for such care compared with present use of health services for mental health reasons. RESULTS: Over 40 years, increased access to mental health services in a simulated population of adults with incident depression would lead to significantly lower lifetime prevalence of hospitalizations (27.9% versus 30.2% base case) and suicide attempts (14.1% versus 14.6%); fewer suicides (184 versus 250); a per-person gain of .17 quality-adjusted life years; and average societal cost savings of $2,590 CAD per person (range $1,266-$6,320). Publicly funding psychological services would translate to additional costs of $123,212,872 CAD ($67,709,860-$190,922,732) over 40 years. Savings to society would reach, on average, $246,997,940 CAD ($120,733,356-$602,713,120). CONCLUSIONS: In Canada, every $1 invested in covering psychological services would yield $2.00 ($1.78 to $3.15) in savings to society.

16918,Potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of drug therapy for prehypertension,"BACKGROUND: Studies have reported that pharmacologic interventions with candesartan or ramipril could reduce the risk of hypertension among prehypertensive subjects free of clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), however, the cost-effectiveness and long-term cardiovascular risk of drug treatment among these population is unclear. METHOD: A Markov state-transition model was developed to simulate a hypothetical cohort of Chinese adults with high-range prehypertension (130-139/85-89mmHg) but without CVD. Data on the incidence of CVD and hypertension was obtained from corresponding risk equations. Utility and disease-related costs were obtained from published literatures. Robustness and uncertainty was evaluated using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, drug treatment resulted in delaying the development of hypertension by nearly 12years and reducing the absolute incidence of hypertension by 32.01% over lifetime. The cumulative incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke and heart failure were reduced and survival was improved from 28.46 to 28.80years. The average incremental cost effectiveness ratio for drug treatment was $12,994 per quality-adjusted life-year and the value was mostly sensitive to the effect size of treatment and age starting treatment. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of >3xChina gross domestic product per capita in 2014, there was a 30.48% chance that drug treatment would remain cost-effective and a low chance of being cost-effective if relative risk of treatment on hypertension was larger than 0.64. CONCLUSION: Drug treatment for prehypertension may help stem the current epidemic of hypertension among Chinese adults free of CVD, which may in turn reduce CVD complications and potentially be cost effective.",2017-01-23162,28501349,Int J Cardiol,Tao Chen,2017,/,,No,28501349,"Tao Chen; Dahai Yu; Victoria Cornelius; Rui Qin; Yamei Cai; Zhixin Jiang; Zhanzheng Zhao; Potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of drug therapy for prehypertension, Int J Cardiol, 2017 May 05; ():0167-5273",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Drug treatment (Antihypertensive treatment) vs. Placebo,Not Stated,80 Years,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 5 and 10 years",3.00,3.00,12994,United States,2014,14205.66
16919,What is the impact on the healthcare system if access to bariatric surgery is delayed?,"BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery has been available as part of the Brazilian Public Health System for patients with body mass index>40 kg/m2 (or>35 kg/m2 with co-morbidities) since 1999. However, access to surgery is challenging, with eligible patients waiting up to 7 years before surgery. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to compare costs and effectiveness of different waiting times before surgery versus prompt surgery. SETTINGS: Public practice. METHODS: A Markov microsimulation model compared 5 different strategies: no surgery, prompt surgery, and delaying surgery for 1, 2, 4, and 7 years. Markov tracker variables and states reflected changes in body mass index, type 2 diabetes status (including remission and relapse), and cardiovascular events. Time horizon was 20 years; discount rate, 5%; and the perspective of the Brazilian Public Health System. Effectiveness was calculated as quality adjusted life years. RESULTS: Prompt surgery was the least costly and most effective strategy compared with any delay. Costs increased and effectiveness diminished progressively with the length of delays. Waiting 7 years for surgery was the most expensive and least effective strategy. Prompt surgery maintained dominance in 99.9%, 90.7%, 96.1%, and 94.2% of simulations in probabilistic sensitivity analyses versus 1-, 2-, 4-, and 7-year delays, respectively.

16924,The cost-effectiveness of high-risk lung cancer screening and drivers of program efficiency,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer risk prediction models have the potential to make programs more affordable; however, the economic evidence is limited. METHODS: Participants in the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NLST) were retrospectively identified with the PLCOm2009 risk-prediction tool. The high-risk subgroup was assessed for lung cancer incidences and demographic character compared with the low-risk subgroup and the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (PanCan)-an observational study, that was high-risk selected in Canada. A comparison of high-risk screening versus standard care was made with a decision-analytic model, using data from the NLST with Canadian cost data from screening and treatment in the PanCan study. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty and identify drivers of program efficiency. RESULTS: Use of the PLCOm2009 risk prediction tool with a threshold set at 2% over 6 years would have reduced the number needed to screen in the NLST by 81%. High-risk screening participants in the NLST had more adverse demographic characteristics than the PanCan study. High-risk screening would cost $20,724 (2015 CAD) per quality-adjusted life year gained (QALY) and would be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/QALY with a probability of 0.62. Cost-effectiveness was driven primarily by non-lung cancer outcomes. Higher non-curative drug costs or current costs for immunotherapy and targeted therapies in the U.S. would render lung cancer screening a cost-saving intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Non-lung cancer outcomes drive screening efficiency in diverse, tobacco-exposed populations. Use of risk selection can reduce the budget impact and screening may even offer cost-savings if non-curative treatment costs continue to rise.",2017-01-23168,28499861,J Thorac Oncol,Sonya Cressman,2017,/,,No,28499861,"Sonya Cressman; Stuart J Peacock; Martin C Tammemagi; William K Evans; Natasha B Leighl; John R Goffin; Alain Tremblay; Geoffrey Liu; Daria Manos; Paul MacEachern; Rick Bhatia; Serge Puksa; Garth Nicholas; Annette McWilliams; John R Mayo; John Yee; John C English; Reka Pataky; Emily McPherson; Sukhinder Atkar-Khattra; Michael R Johnston; Heidi Schmidt; Frances A Shepherd; Kam Soghrati; Kayvan Amjadi; Paul Burrowes; Christian Couture; Harmanjatinder S Sekhon; Kazuhiro Yasufuku; Glenwood Goss; Diana N Ionescu; David M Hwang; Simon Martel; Don D Sin; Wan C Tan; Stefan Urbanski; Zhaolin Xu; Ming-Sound Tsao; Stephen Lam; The cost-effectiveness of high-risk lung cancer screening and drivers of program efficiency, J Thorac Oncol, 2017 May 09; ():1556-1380",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening of high-risk individuals vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,20724,Canada,2015,17719.47

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the current vaccination strategy (a single-dose PPSV23 vaccination) compared to a single-dose PCV13 vaccination and sequential PCV13-PPSV23 vaccinations in the elderly population aged >/= 65 years. METHODS: Using a Markov model, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of three vaccination strategies were assessed in a societal context. The transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality adjusted life year (QALY), and disease treatment costs were either calculated or cited from published data and the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Simulations were performed in hypothetical cohorts of Korean adults aged >/= 19 years. The vaccine effectiveness of PPSV23 was cited from a Cochrane Review report, while PCV13 effectiveness data were gathered from the CAPiTA trial. RESULTS: Current PPSV23 vaccination strategies were cost-effective (ICER, $25,786 per QALY). However, the administration of PCV13 as a substitute for PPSV23 was shown to be more cost-effective than PPSV23 vaccination (ICER, $797 per QALY). Sequential PCV13-PPSV23 vaccination was also more cost-effective than PPSV23 for elderly people aged >/= 65 years. In sensitivity analysis assuming significant PPSV23 effectiveness (50%) against non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, the PCV13 vaccination strategy was superior to the PPSV23 vaccination strategy in terms of cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that PCV13 vaccination is more cost-effective in elderly subjects aged >/= 65 years compared to the current PPSV23 vaccination strategy.

Algorithmic-based treatment delivered by either a consultant gastroenterologist or a clinical nurse specialist has been shown in a randomized trial to be statistically and clinically more effective than provision of a self-help booklet. In this study, we assessed cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Outcomes were measured at baseline (pre-randomization) and 6 months. Change in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was the primary outcome for the economic evaluation; a secondary analysis used change in the bowel subset score of the modified Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ-B). Intervention costs, British pounds 2013, covered visits with the gastroenterologist or nurse, investigations, medications and treatments. Incremental outcomes and incremental costs were estimated simultaneously using multivariate linear regression. Uncertainty was handled non-parametrically using bootstrap with replacement. RESULTS: The mean (SD) cost of treatment was pound895 (499) for the nurse and pound1101 (567) for the consultant.

16936,Cost-effectiveness of Intravitreous Ranibizumab Compared With Panretinal Photocoagulation for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy: Secondary Analysis From a Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Randomized Clinical Trial,"Importance: The Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network Protocol S randomized clinical trial results suggest that ranibizumab is a reasonable treatment alternative to panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) when managing proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), with or without concomitant baseline diabetic macular edema (DME). However, ranibizumab injections are costly. Thus, it would be useful to examine the relative cost-effectiveness of these 2 treatment modalities. Objective: To evaluate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 0.5-mg ranibizumab therapy vs PRP for PDR. Design, Setting, and Participants: Preplanned secondary analysis using efficacy, safety, and resource utilization data through 2 years of follow-up at 55 US sites for 213 adults with PDR. Data were collected from February 2012 to January 2015. Interventions: Intravitreous 0.5-mg ranibizumab at baseline and as frequently as every 4 weeks based on a structured retreatment protocol or PRP at baseline for PDR. Eyes in both groups could receive ranibizumab for concomitant DME. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ranibizumab compared with PRP evaluated within 2 prespecified subgroups for the study eye: with baseline vision-impairing (Snellen equivalent 20/32 or worse) DME and without baseline vision-impairing DME. Results: The study included 305 adults with PDR, the mean age was 52 years, 44% were women, and 52% were white. Of the 46 participants with PDR and vision-impairing DME at baseline, 21 were assigned to the ranibizumab group and 25 to the PRP group (plus ranibizumab for DME). Among the remaining participants without baseline vision-impairing DME, 80 and 87 were in the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively. For participants with and without baseline vision-impairing DME, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ranibizumab therapy compared with PRP were $55568/quality-adjusted life-year and $662978/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively, over 2 years. Conclusions and Relevance: Over 2 years, compared with PRP, 0.5-mg ranibizumab as given in this trial is within the $50000/quality-adjusted life-year to $150000/quality-adjusted life-year range frequently cited as cost-effective in the United States for eyes presenting with PDR and vision-impairing DME, but not for those with PDR without vision-impairing DME.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Preplanned secondary analysis using efficacy, safety, and resource utilization data through 2 years of follow-up at 55 US sites for 213 adults with PDR. Data were collected from February 2012 to January 2015. Interventions: Intravitreous 0.5-mg ranibizumab at baseline and as frequently as every 4 weeks based on a structured retreatment protocol or PRP at baseline for PDR. Eyes in both groups could receive ranibizumab for concomitant DME. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ranibizumab compared with PRP evaluated within 2 prespecified subgroups for the study eye: with baseline vision-impairing (Snellen equivalent 20/32 or worse) DME and without baseline vision-impairing DME. Results: The study included 305 adults with PDR, the mean age was 52 years, 44% were women, and 52% were white. Of the 46 participants with PDR and vision-impairing DME at baseline, 21 were assigned to the ranibizumab group and 25 to the PRP group (plus ranibizumab for DME). Among the remaining participants without baseline vision-impairing DME, 80 and 87 were in the ranibizumab and PRP groups, respectively. For participants with and without baseline vision-impairing DME, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of ranibizumab therapy compared with PRP were $55568/quality-adjusted life-year and $662978/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively, over 2 years. Conclusions and Relevance: Over 2 years, compared with PRP, 0.5-mg ranibizumab as given in this trial is within the $50000/quality-adjusted life-year to $150000/quality-adjusted life-year range frequently cited as cost-effective in the United States for eyes presenting with PDR and vision-impairing DME, but not for those with PDR without vision-impairing DME.

16938,Use of opioid substitution therapies in the treatment of opioid use disorder: results of a UK cost-effectiveness modelling study,"AIMS: We investigated the cost-effectiveness of buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) and methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) versus no opioid substitution therapy (OST) for the treatment of opioid use disorder, from the UK National Health Service (NHS)/personal social services (PSS) and societal perspectives over one year. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness of OST versus no OST was evaluated by first replicating and then expanding an existing UK health technology assessment model. The expanded model included the impact of OST on infection rates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. RESULTS: Versus no OST, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for BMT and MMT were pound13,923 and pound14,206 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively, from a NHS/PSS perspective. When total costs (NHS/PSS and societal) are considered, there are substantial savings associated with adopting OST; these savings are in excess of pound14,032 for BMT versus no OST and pound17,174 for MMT versus no OST over one year, respectively. This is primarily driven by a reduction in victim costs. OST treatment also impacted other aspects of criminality and healthcare resource use. LIMITATIONS: The model''s one-year timeframe means long-term costs and benefits and the influence of changes over time are not captured. CONCLUSIONS: OST can be considered cost-effective versus no OST from the UK NHS/PSS perspective, with a cost per QALY well below the UK''s willingness-to-pay threshold.

16942,"Cost-Effectiveness of Lenvatinib, Sorafenib, and Placebo in the Treatment of Radioiodine Refractory Differentiated Thyroid Cancer","BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib (Lenvima(R)) and sorafenib (Nexavar(R)) are the two most recently FDA-approved drugs for treating radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). Both demonstrated superior progression-free survival over placebo in their respective phase III clinical trials. In this study, we compared the cost-effectiveness of the two treatments with placebo from a limited societal perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs and health benefits for treatment of RR-DTC. The probabilities and survival rates were obtained from two phase-III trials-the SELECT trial comparing lenvatinib to placebo, and the DECISION trial comparing sorafenib to placebo. We used a bi-monthly cycle length and half-cycle correction for a lifetime time horizon. Medical costs and utility data were obtained from RedBook, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and the published literature. All costs were adjusted to 2015 USD, discounted at 3% annually. Then second-order Monte Carlo simulation with distributions was conducted to obtain the acceptability curve to address the uncertainty around model inputs. RESULTS: In the base-case, lenvatinib was the most cost-effective treatment compared to sorafenib (ICER=$25,275/QALY) and placebo (ICER=$40,869). Sorafenib is also cost-effective compared to placebo (ICER=$64,067/QALY).

16945,Cost-effectiveness of denosumab versus zoledronic acid for preventing skeletal-related events in the Czech Republic,"AIMS: This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of the subcutaneous RANKL inhibitor, denosumab, versus the intravenous bisphosphonate, zoledronic acid, for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with prostate cancer, breast cancer, and other solid tumors (OST) in the Czech Republic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed to compare the effects of denosumab and zoledronic acid on costs (including drug costs and administration, patient management, SREs, and adverse events), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from a national payer perspective. Different discount rates, time horizons, SRE rates, distributions, and nature (asymptomatic vs all SREs), and the inclusion of treatment discontinuation were considered in scenario analyses. The robustness of the model was tested using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Across tumor types, denosumab was associated with fewer SREs, improved QALYs, and higher total costs over a lifetime. The incremental cost per QALY gained for denosumab versus zoledronic acid was 382,673 CZK for prostate cancer, 408,450 CZK for breast cancer, and 608,133 CZK for OST. Incremental costs per SRE avoided for the same tumor type were 54,007 CZK, 51,765 CZK, and 94,426 CZK, respectively. In scenario analyses, the results remained similar to baseline when different discount rates and time horizons were considered. At a non-official willingness-to-pay threshold of 1.2 million CZK, the probabilities of denosumab being cost-effective versus zoledronic acid were 0.64, 0.67, and 0.49 for prostate cancer, breast cancer, and OST, respectively.

16948,Observed Cost and Variations in Short Term Cost-Effectiveness of Therapy for Ischemic Stroke in Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS) III,"BACKGROUND: Examination of linked data on patient outcomes and cost of care may help identify areas where stroke care can be improved. We report on the association between variations in stroke severity, patient outcomes, cost, and treatment patterns observed over the acute hospital stay and through the 12-month follow-up for subjects receiving endovascular therapy compared to intravenous tissue plasminogen activator alone in the IMS (Interventional Management of Stroke) III Trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prospective data collected for a prespecified economic analysis of the trial were used. Data included hospital billing records for the initial stroke admission and subsequent detailed resource use after the acute hospitalization collected at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Cost of follow-up care varied 6-fold for patients in the lowest (0-1) and highest (20+) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale category at 5 days, and by modified Rankin Scale at 3 months. The kind of resources used postdischarge also varied between treatment groups. Incremental short-term cost-effectiveness ratios varied greatly when treatments were compared for patient subgroups. Patient subgroups predefined by stroke severity had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $97 303/quality-adjusted life year (severe stroke) and $3 187 805/quality-adjusted life year (moderately severe stroke). CONCLUSIONS: Detailed economic and resource utilization data from IMS III provide powerful evidence for the large effect that patient outcome has on the economic value of medical and endovascular reperfusion therapies. These data can be used to inform process improvements for stroke care and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of endovascular therapy in the US health system for stroke intervention trials.

16949,Mobile App for Treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Mobile apps can increase access to care, facilitate self-management, and improve adherence to treatment. Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) affects 10-35% of women and, currently, an app with instructions for pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) is available as first-line treatment. A previous randomized controlled study demonstrated that the app benefitted symptom severity and quality of life (QoL); in this study we investigate the cost-effectiveness of the app. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the health economy of the app for treating SUI. METHODS: This deterministic cost-utility analysis, with a 1-year societal perspective, compared the app treatment with no treatment. Health economic data were collected alongside a randomized controlled trial performed in Sweden from March 2013 to October 2014. This study included 123 community-dwelling women participants of 18 years and above, with stress urinary incontinence >/=1 time per week. Participants were self-assessed with validated questionnaires and 2-day leakage diaries, and then randomized to 3 months of treatment (app group, n=62) or no treatment (controls, n=61). The app focused on pelvic floor muscle training, prescribed 3 times daily. We continuously registered treatment delivery costs. Data were collected on each participant''s training time, incontinence aids, and laundry at baseline and at a 3-month follow-up. We measured quality of life with the International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire on Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms and Quality of Life, and calculated the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Data from the 3-month follow-up were extrapolated to 1 year for the calculations. Our main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios compared between app and control groups. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 44.7 years (SD 9.4). Annual costs were euro547.0 for the app group and euro482.4 for the control group. Annual gains in quality-adjusted life years for app and control groups were 0.0101 and 0.0016, respectively. Compared with controls, the extra cost per quality-adjusted life year for the app group ranged from -euro2425.7 to euro14,870.6, which indicated greater gains in quality-adjusted life years at similar or slightly higher cost. CONCLUSIONS: The app for treating stress urinary incontinence is a new, cost-effective, first-line treatment with potential for increasing access to care in a sustainable way for this patient group.",2017-01-23207,28483745,J Med Internet Res,Malin Sjostrom,2017,19 / 5,e154,No,28483745,"Malin Sjostrom; Lars Lindholm; Eva Samuelsson; Mobile App for Treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, J Med Internet Res, 2017 May 08; 19(5):1438-8871; e154",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mobile app (Tät) with pelvic floor muscle training (3 months) vs. None,"Community-dwelling women, age >=18, with stress urinary incontinence of at least once a week",Not Stated,18 Years,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,7615.5,Euro,2013,11236.97
16950,Targeted outreach hepatitis B vaccination program in high-risk adults: The fundamental challenge of the last mile,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the on-going decentralised targeted hepatitis B vaccination program for behavioural high-risk groups operated by regional public health services in the Netherlands since 1-November-2002. Target groups for free vaccination are men having sex with men (MSM), commercial sex workers (CSW) and hard drug users (HDU). Heterosexuals with a high partner change rate (HRP) were included until 1-November-2007. METHODS: Based on participant, vaccination and serology data collected up to 31-December-2012, the number of participants and program costs were estimated. Observed anti-HBc prevalence was used to estimate the probability of susceptible individuals per risk-group to become infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in their remaining life. We distinguished two time-periods: 2002-2006 and 2007-2012, representing different recruitment strategies and target groups. Correcting for observed vaccination compliance, the number of future HBV-infections avoided was estimated per risk-group. By combining these numbers with estimates of life-years lost, quality-of-life losses and healthcare costs of HBV-infections - as obtained from a Markov model-, the benefit of the program was estimated for each risk-group separately. RESULTS: The overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the program was euro30,400/QALY gained, with effects and costs discounted at 1.5% and 4%, respectively. The program was more cost-effective in the first period (euro24,200/QALY) than in the second period (euro42,400/QALY). In particular, the cost-effectiveness for MSM decreased from euro20,700/QALY to euro47,700/QALY. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This decentralised targeted HBV-vaccination program is a cost-effective intervention in certain unvaccinated high-risk adults. Saturation within the risk-groups, participation of individuals with less risky behaviour, and increased recruitment investments in the second period made the program less cost-effective over time. The project should therefore discus how to reduce costs per risk-group, increase effects or when to integrate the vaccination in regular healthcare.",2017-01-23209,28483198,Vaccine,M-J J Mangen,2017,35 / 24,3215-3221,Yes,28483198,"M-J J Mangen; H Stibbe; A Urbanus; E C Siedenburg; Q Waldhober; G A De Wit; J E van Steenbergen; National Working Group of hepati; Targeted outreach hepatitis B vaccination program in high-risk adults: The fundamental challenge of the last mile, Vaccine, 2017 May 31; 35(24):1873-2518; 3215-3221",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hepatitis B vaccination program vs. None,"Participants in vaccination program 2002-2006, at high risk for hepatitis B (men having sex with men, heterosexuals with a high rate of partner change, commercial sex workers, and hard drug users)",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,4.00,1.50,24200,Euro,2012,35078.1

16952,Herpes zoster vaccine: A health economic evaluation for Switzerland,"Herpes zoster (HZ) or ""shingles"" results from a reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) acquired during primary infection (chickenpox) and surviving in the dorsal root ganglia. In about 20% of cases, a complication occurs, known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). A live attenuated vaccine against VZV is available for the prevention of HZ and subsequent PHN. The present study aims to update an earlier evaluation estimating the cost-effectiveness of the HZ vaccine from a Swiss third party payer perspective. It takes into account updated vaccine prices, a different age cohort, latest clinical data and burden of illness data. A Markov model was developed to simulate the lifetime consequences of vaccinating 15% of the Swiss population aged 65-79 y. Information from sentinel data, official statistics and published literature were used. Endpoints assessed were number of HZ and PHN cases, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs of hospitalizations, consultations and prescriptions. Based on a vaccine price of CHF 162, the vaccination strategy accrued additional costs of CHF 17,720,087 and gained 594 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was CHF 29,814 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were most sensitive to epidemiological inputs, utility values, discount rates, duration of vaccine efficacy, and vaccine price. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated a more than 99% chance that the ICER was below 40,000 CHF per QALY. Findings were in line with existing cost-effectiveness analyses of HZ vaccination. This updated study supports the value of an HZ vaccination strategy targeting the Swiss population aged 65-79 y.",2017-01-23213,28481678,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Patricia R Blank,2017,/,1-10,No,28481678,"Patricia R Blank; Zanfina Ademi; Xiaoyan Lu; Thomas D Szucs; Matthias Schwenkglenks; Herpes zoster vaccine: A health economic evaluation for Switzerland, Hum Vaccin Immunother , 2017 May 08; ():2164-554X; 1-10",QALY,Switzerland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Herpes zoster vaccination with 15% vaccine coverage rate vs. None,Not Stated,79 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,1.50,29814,Switzerland,2014,35677.19

METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling to evaluate the efficiency of varicella vaccine immunisation programme for the elderly in Japan. Four strategies with different ages to receive a shot of vaccine were set, namely: (1) 65-84, (2) 70-84, (3) 75-84 and (4) 80-84years old (y.o.). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with no programme from societal perspective were calculated. The health statuses following the target cohort are as follows: without any HZ-related disease, acute HZ followed by recovery, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) followed by recovery, post HZ/PHN, and general death. The transition probabilities, utility weights to estimate quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and disease treatment costs were either calculated or cited from literature. Costs of per course of vaccination were assumed at yen10,000 (US$91). The model with one-year cycle runs until the surviving individual reached 100 y.o. RESULTS: ICERs ranged from yen2,812,000/US$25,680 to yen3,644,000/US$33,279 per QALY gained, with 65-84 y.o. strategy having the lowest ICER and 80-84 y.o. strategy the highest. None of the alternatives was strongly dominated by the other, while 80-84 y.o. and 70-84 y.o. strategy were extendedly dominated by 65-84 y.o. STRATEGY: Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the probabilities that ICER is under yen5,000,000/US$45,662 per QALY gained was at 100% for 65-84 y.o., 70-84 y.o., 75-84 y.o. strategy, respectively, and at 98.4% for 80-84 y.o.

METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov modelling to evaluate the efficiency of varicella vaccine immunisation programme for the elderly in Japan. Four strategies with different ages to receive a shot of vaccine were set, namely: (1) 65-84, (2) 70-84, (3) 75-84 and (4) 80-84years old (y.o.). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared with no programme from societal perspective were calculated. The health statuses following the target cohort are as follows: without any HZ-related disease, acute HZ followed by recovery, post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) followed by recovery, post HZ/PHN, and general death.

16960,Early Assessment of Cost-effectiveness of Gastric Electrical Stimulation for Diabetic Nausea and Vomiting,"Background/Aims: Recurrent nausea and/or vomiting are common complications of diabetes mellitus. The conditions severely impact the quality of life of patients and often cause repeated admissions to hospital incurring significant healthcare costs. If standard treatment fails, gastric electrical stimulation (GES) may be offered in selected cases, as a minimally invasive, but expensive, therapeutic option. Our aims are to evaluate the clinical effect and the cost-utility of GES as a treatment for severe diabetic recurrent nausea and/or vomiting. Methods: Among 33 diabetes patients implanted with GES because of recurrent nausea and/or vomiting, 30 were available for evaluation. The effect of treatment was assessed prospectively using symptom-diaries and the SF-36 questionnaires at baseline, after 6 and 12 months, and thereafter yearly. The number of days in hospital due to symptoms related to gastrointestinal dysfunction was calculated using hospital records 12 months prior to and 12 months after implantation. Results: The surgical procedures were performed without mortality or major complications. Six months after surgery 78% of the respondents had at least 50% reduction in time with nausea and 48% had at least 50% reduction in days with vomiting. Symptom relief persisted at follow-up after at least 4 years. Quality adjusted life years improved after GES, which was cost-effective after 24 months. Conclusions: GES reduces symptoms and improves quality of life in diabetes patients with recurrent nausea and/or vomiting. The procedure is supposed as cost-effective over a 2-year time horizon.",2017-01-23218,28478663,J Neurogastroenterol Motil,Mette W Klinge,2017,/,,No,28478663,"Mette W Klinge; Peter Rask; Lene S Mortensen; Kathrine Lassen; Niels Ejskjaer; Lars H Ehlers; Klaus Krogh; Early Assessment of Cost-effectiveness of Gastric Electrical Stimulation for Diabetic Nausea and Vomiting, J Neurogastroenterol Motil , 2017 May 04; ():2093-0887",QALY,Denmark,Not Stated,Not Stated,Gastric electrical stimulation vs. None,Type 1 and 2 diabetes patients with severe recurrent nausea and vomiting,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"2 Years, 1 year",Not Stated,Not Stated,676,Euro,2016,806.64

METHODS: Multicentre, national electronic medical record (EMR) study on treatment naive nAMD eyes undergoing PRN ranibizumab or continuous (fixed or treat and extend (F/TE)) aflibercept from 21 UK hospitals. Anonymised data were extracted, and eyes were matched on age, gender, starting visual acuity (VA) and year of starting treatment. Primary outcome was change in vision at 1 year. RESULTS: 1884 eyes (942 eyes in each group) were included. At year 1, patients on PRN ranibizumab gained 1.6 ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) letters (95% CI 0.5 to 2.7, p=0.004), while patients on F/TE aflibercept gained 6.1 letters (95% CI 5.1 to 7.1, p=2.2e-16). Change in vision at 1 year of the F/TE aflibercept group was 4.1 letters higher (95% CI 2.5 to 5.8, p=1.3e-06) compared with the PRN ranibizumab group after adjusting for age, starting VA, gender and year of starting therapy. The F/TE aflibercept group had significantly more injections compared with the PRN ranibizumab group (7.0 vs 5.8, p<2.2e-16), but required less clinic visits than the PRN ranibizumab group (10.8 vs 9.0, p<2.2e-16). Cost-effectiveness analysis showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 58 047.14 GBP/quality-adjusted life year for continuous aflibercept over PRN ranibizumab. CONCLUSION: Aflibercept achieved greater VA gains at 1 year than ranibizumab. The observed VA differences are small and likely to be related to more frequent treatment with aflibercept, suggesting that ranibizumab should also be delivered by F/TE posology.",2017-01-23220,28478396,Br J Ophthalmol,Aaron Y Lee,2017,/,,No,28478396,"Aaron Y Lee; Cecilia S Lee; Catherine A Egan; Clare Bailey; Robert L Johnston; Salim Natha; Robin Hamilton; Rehna Khan; Sahar Al-Husainy; Christopher Brand; Toks Akerele; Martin Mckibbin; Louise Downey; Adnan Tufail; UK AMD/DR EMR REPORT IX: comparative effectiveness of predominantly as needed (PRN) ranibizumab versus continuous aflibercept in UK clinical practice, Br J Ophthalmol, 2017 May 06; ():0007-1161",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous aflibercept vs. Pro re nata (PRN) ranibizumab therapy,Neovascular age-related macular degeneration,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,67707,United Kingdom,2015,113006.49

This economic analysis details the management of patients who responded inadequately due to lack of efficacy or intolerability to two previous antidepressants in the UK. METHODS: The model included a decision tree and a Markov component. Health states considered in the decision tree were remission, response, no response, withdrawal due to adverse events, relapse, recovery, and recurrence. The time horizon was 24 months. Patients were on third-line treatment for up to a 3-month acute phase and a 6-month maintenance phase. As third-line efficacy data were not available, inputs were calculated by adjusting original second-line data to third-line based on proportionate reductions observed in STAR*D. Equivalent efficacy was assumed for all comparators. Healthcare resource use and utilities were based on UK estimates. RESULTS: Vortioxetine was a cost-effective treatment option at a threshold of pound20,000/QALY vs. escitalopram, citalopram, sertraline, and was associated with more health benefits, less costs (was dominant) versus relevant third-line comparators venlafaxine and duloxetine.

16968,Extended and standard duration weight-loss programme referrals for adults in primary care (WRAP): a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Evidence exist that primary care referral to an open-group behavioural programme is an effective strategy for management of obesity, but little evidence on optimal intervention duration is available. We aimed to establish whether 52-week referral to an open-group weight-management programme would achieve greater weight loss and improvements in a range of health outcomes and be more cost-effective than the current practice of 12-week referrals. METHODS: In this non-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we recruited participants who were aged 18 years or older and had body-mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m2 or higher from 23 primary care practices in England. Participants were randomly assigned (2:5:5) to brief advice and self-help materials, a weight-management programme (Weight Watchers) for 12 weeks, or the same weight-management programme for 52 weeks. We followed-up participants over 2 years. The primary outcome was weight at 1 year of follow-up, analysed with mixed-effects models according to intention-to-treat principles and adjusted for centre and baseline weight. In a hierarchical closed-testing procedure, we compared combined behavioural programme arms with brief intervention, then compared the 12-week programme and 52-week programme. We did a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis using person-level data and modelled outcomes over a 25-year time horizon using microsimulation. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN82857232. FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2012, and Feb 10, 2014, we enrolled 1269 participants. 1267 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the brief intervention (n=211), the 12-week programme (n=528), and the 52-week programme (n=528). Two participants in the 12-week programme had been found to be ineligible shortly after randomisation and were excluded from the analysis. 823 (65%) of 1267 participants completed an assessment at 1 year and 856 (68%) participants at 2 years. All eligible participants were included in the analyses. At 1 year, mean weight changes in the groups were -3.26 kg (brief intervention), -4.75 kg (12-week programme), and -6.76 kg (52-week programme). Participants in the behavioural programme lost more weight than those in the brief intervention (adjusted difference -2.71 kg, 95% CI -3.86 to -1.55; p<0.0001). The 52-week programme was more effective than the 12-week programme (-2.14 kg, -3.05 to -1.22; p<0.0001). Differences between groups were still significant at 2 years. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported. Over 2 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; compared with brief intervention) was pound159 per kg lost for the 52-week programme and pound91 per kg for the 12-week programme. Modelled over 25 years after baseline, the ICER for the 12-week programme was dominant compared with the brief intervention. The ICER for the 52-week programme was cost-effective compared with the brief intervention ( pound2394 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) and the 12-week programme ( pound3804 per QALY). INTERPRETATION: For adults with overweight or obesity, referral to this open-group behavioural weight-loss programme for at least 12 weeks is more effective than brief advice and self-help materials.

We aimed to establish whether 52-week referral to an open-group weight-management programme would achieve greater weight loss and improvements in a range of health outcomes and be more cost-effective than the current practice of 12-week referrals. METHODS: In this non-blinded, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial, we recruited participants who were aged 18 years or older and had body-mass index (BMI) of 28 kg/m2 or higher from 23 primary care practices in England. Participants were randomly assigned (2:5:5) to brief advice and self-help materials, a weight-management programme (Weight Watchers) for 12 weeks, or the same weight-management programme for 52 weeks. We followed-up participants over 2 years. The primary outcome was weight at 1 year of follow-up, analysed with mixed-effects models according to intention-to-treat principles and adjusted for centre and baseline weight. In a hierarchical closed-testing procedure, we compared combined behavioural programme arms with brief intervention, then compared the 12-week programme and 52-week programme. We did a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis using person-level data and modelled outcomes over a 25-year time horizon using microsimulation. This study is registered with Current Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN82857232. FINDINGS: Between Oct 18, 2012, and Feb 10, 2014, we enrolled 1269 participants. 1267 eligible participants were randomly assigned to the brief intervention (n=211), the 12-week programme (n=528), and the 52-week programme (n=528). Two participants in the 12-week programme had been found to be ineligible shortly after randomisation and were excluded from the analysis. 823 (65%) of 1267 participants completed an assessment at 1 year and 856 (68%) participants at 2 years. All eligible participants were included in the analyses. At 1 year, mean weight changes in the groups were -3.26 kg (brief intervention), -4.75 kg (12-week programme), and -6.76 kg (52-week programme). Participants in the behavioural programme lost more weight than those in the brief intervention (adjusted difference -2.71 kg, 95% CI -3.86 to -1.55; p<0.0001). The 52-week programme was more effective than the 12-week programme (-2.14 kg, -3.05 to -1.22; p<0.0001). Differences between groups were still significant at 2 years. No adverse events related to the intervention were reported. Over 2 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER; compared with brief intervention) was pound159 per kg lost for the 52-week programme and pound91 per kg for the 12-week programme. Modelled over 25 years after baseline, the ICER for the 12-week programme was dominant compared with the brief intervention. The ICER for the 52-week programme was cost-effective compared with the brief intervention ( pound2394 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]) and the 12-week programme ( pound3804 per QALY).

16971,The cost-effectiveness of a mechanical compression device in out of hospital cardiac arrest,"AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of LUCAS-2, a mechanical device for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) as compared to manual chest compressions in adults with non-traumatic, out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: We analysed patient-level data from a large, pragmatic, multi-centre trial linked to administrative secondary care data from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) to measure healthcare resource use, costs and outcomes in both arms. A within-trial analysis using quality adjusted life years derived from the EQ-5D-3L was conducted at 12-month follow-up and results were extrapolated to the lifetime horizon using a decision-analytic model. RESULTS: 4471 patients were enrolled in the trial (1652 assigned to the LUCAS-2 group, 2819 assigned to the control group). At 12 months, 89 (5%) patients survived in the LUCAS-2 group and 175 (6%) survived in the manual CPR group. In the vast majority of analyses conducted, both within-trial and by extrapolation of the results over a lifetime horizon, manual CPR dominates LUCAS-2. In other words, patients in the LUCAS-2 group had poorer health outcomes (i.e. lower QALYs) and incurred higher health and social care costs.

16972,Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of three different compression systems in newly-diagnosed venous leg ulcers in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of using a two-layer cohesive compression bandage (TLCCB; Coban 2) compared with a two-layer compression system (TLCS; KTwo) and a four-layer compression system (FLCS; Profore) in treating newly-diagnosed venous leg ulcers (VLUs) in clinical practice in the UK, from the perspective of the NHS. METHOD: This was a retrospective cohort analysis of the case records of patients with newly-diagnosed VLUs randomly extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (a nationally representative database of clinical practice among patients registered with general practitioners in the UK) who were treated with either TLCCB (n=200), TLCS (n=200) or FLCS (n=200). The clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of the alternative compression systems were estimated over six months after starting treatment. RESULTS: Patients'' mean age was 72 years and 58% were female. Time from wound onset to the start of compression was a mean of two months, and when starting compression the wound size was a mean of 45 cm2. The distribution of healing was significantly different between the three groups; 76% of wounds in the TLCCB group healed by six months compared with 70% and 64% in the TLCS and FLCS groups, respectively (p=0.006). Time to healing was significantly less in the TLCCB group compared with the two other groups (p=0.003). Patients in the TLCCB group experienced better health-related quality of life over six months (0.413 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient), compared with the TLCS and FLCS groups (0.404 and 0.396 QALYs per patient, respectively). The mean six-month NHS management cost was pound3045, pound3842 and pound4480 per patient in the TLCCB, TLCS and FLCS groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Real-world evidence demonstrates that treating newly-diagnosed VLUs with TLCCB, compared with the other two compression systems, affords a more cost-effective use of NHS-funded resources in clinical practice since it resulted in an increased healing rate, better health-related quality of life and a reduction in NHS management cost.",2017-01-23227,28475441,J Wound Care,J F Guest,2017,26 / 5,244-254,No,28475441,"J F Guest; G W Fuller; P Vowden; Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of three different compression systems in newly-diagnosed venous leg ulcers in the UK, J Wound Care, 2017 May 02; 26(5):0969-0700; 244-254",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Two-layer cohesive compression bandage (TLCCB) vs. Two-layer compression system (TLCS),Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-88555.56,United Kingdom,2015,-147803.82

16974,Cost-effectiveness of human papillomavirus vaccination for adolescent girls in Punjab state: Implications for India's universal immunization program,"BACKGROUND: Introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination for adolescent girls is being considered in the Punjab state of India. However, evidence regarding cost-effectiveness is sought by policy makers when making this decision. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with introduction of the HPV vaccine compared with a no-vaccination scenario. METHODS: A static progression model, using a combination of decision tree and Markov models, was populated using epidemiological, cost, coverage, and effectiveness data to determine the cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination. Using a societal perspective, lifetime costs and consequences (in terms of QALYs) among a cohort of 11-year-old adolescent girls in Punjab state were modeled in 2 alternate scenarios with and without vaccination. All costs and consequences were discounted at a rate of 3%. RESULTS: Although immunizing 1 year''s cohort of 11-year-old girls in Punjab state costs Indian National Rupees (INR) 135 million (US dollars [USD] 2.08 million and International dollars [Int$] 6.25 million) on an absolute basis, its net cost after accounting for treatment savings is INR 38 million (USD 0.58 million and Int$ 1.76 million). Incremental cost per QALY gained for HPV vaccination was found to be INR 73 (USD 1.12 and Int$ 3.38). Given all the data uncertainties, there is a 90% probability for the vaccination strategy to be cost-effective in Punjab state at a willingness-to-pay threshold of INR 10,000, which is less than one-tenth of the per capita gross domestic product.

16975,Cost-Effectiveness of Palbociclib in Hormone Receptor-Positive Advanced Breast Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Palbociclib, a novel small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, has demonstrated significant efficacy in prolonging progression-free survival when added to existing therapies. Considering the high cost of palbociclib, we assessed cost-effectiveness of adding palbociclib to usual care in treatment of advanced breast cancer. METHODS: We developed a discrete event simulation model to simulate time to cancer progression and to compare life time clinical benefit and cost of alternative treatment strategies for patients with metastatic disease from societal perspective. Per approved indication, endocrine treatment naive patients were assigned to palbociclib plus letrozole (PAL+LET) or letrozole alone (LET). Patients with prior endocrine therapy were assigned to palbociclib plus fulvestrant (PAL+FUL) or fulvestrant alone (FUL). The model assumptions were informed based on published clinical trial data and other peer reviewed studies. We performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our results to the changes in model assumptions. RESULTS: In treatment-naive patients, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole cost an estimated $768,498 per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The addition of palbociclib to fulvestrant in patients with prior endocrine therapy cost an estimated $918,166 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated adding palbociclib has a 0% chance of being cost-effectiveness in either patient groups at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY.

16977,Cost-effectiveness of alternate strategies for childhood immunization against meningococcal disease with monovalent and quadrivalent conjugate vaccines in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Public health programs to prevent invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) with monovalent serogroup C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV-C) and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MCV-4) in infancy and adolescence vary across Canadian provinces. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of various vaccination strategies against IMD using current and anticipated future pricing and recent epidemiology. METHODS: A cohort model was developed to estimate the clinical burden and costs (CAN$2014) of IMD in the Canadian population over a 100-year time horizon for three strategies: (1) MCV-C in infants and adolescents (MCV-C/C); (2) MCV-C in infants and MCV-4 in adolescents (MCV-C/4); and (3) MCV-4 in infants (2 doses) and adolescents (MCV-4/4). The source for IMD incidence was Canadian surveillance data. The effectiveness of MCV-C was based on published literature. The effectiveness of MCV-4 against all vaccination regimens was assumed to be the same as for MCV-C regimens against serogroup C. Herd effects were estimated by calibration to estimates reported in prior analyses. Costs were from published sources. Vaccines prices were projected to decline over time reflecting historical procurement trends. RESULTS: Over the modeling horizon there are a projected 11,438 IMD cases and 1,195 IMD deaths with MCV-C/C; expected total costs are $597.5 million. MCV-C/4 is projected to reduce cases of IMD by 1,826 (16%) and IMD deaths by 161 (13%). Vaccination costs are increased by $32 million but direct and indirect IMD costs are projected to be reduced by $46 million. MCV-C/4 is therefore dominant vs. MCV-C/C in the base case. Cost-effectiveness of MCV-4/4 was $111,286 per QALY gained versus MCV-C/4 (2575/206 IMD cases/deaths prevented; incremental costs $68 million). CONCLUSIONS: If historical trends in Canadian vaccines prices continue, use of MCV-4 instead of MCV-C in adolescents may be cost-effective.

Vaccines prices were projected to decline over time reflecting historical procurement trends. RESULTS: Over the modeling horizon there are a projected 11,438 IMD cases and 1,195 IMD deaths with MCV-C/C; expected total costs are $597.5 million. MCV-C/4 is projected to reduce cases of IMD by 1,826 (16%) and IMD deaths by 161 (13%). Vaccination costs are increased by $32 million but direct and indirect IMD costs are projected to be reduced by $46 million. MCV-C/4 is therefore dominant vs. MCV-C/C in the base case.

16979,Cost-effectiveness of alternate strategies for childhood immunization against meningococcal disease with monovalent and quadrivalent conjugate vaccines in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Public health programs to prevent invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) with monovalent serogroup C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV-C) and quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MCV-4) in infancy and adolescence vary across Canadian provinces. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of various vaccination strategies against IMD using current and anticipated future pricing and recent epidemiology. METHODS: A cohort model was developed to estimate the clinical burden and costs (CAN$2014) of IMD in the Canadian population over a 100-year time horizon for three strategies: (1) MCV-C in infants and adolescents (MCV-C/C); (2) MCV-C in infants and MCV-4 in adolescents (MCV-C/4); and (3) MCV-4 in infants (2 doses) and adolescents (MCV-4/4). The source for IMD incidence was Canadian surveillance data. The effectiveness of MCV-C was based on published literature. The effectiveness of MCV-4 against all vaccination regimens was assumed to be the same as for MCV-C regimens against serogroup C. Herd effects were estimated by calibration to estimates reported in prior analyses. Costs were from published sources.

This study calculates the cost-effectiveness of methicillin-resistant S aureus prevention strategies and recommends specific strategies based on screening test implementation. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model from the hospital perspective was conducted to determine if the implementation costs of methicillin-resistant S aureus prevention strategies are justified by associated reductions in methicillin-resistant S aureus infections and improvements in quality-adjusted life years. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses determined the influence of input variation on the cost-effectiveness. SETTING: ICU. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohort of adults admitted to the ICU. INTERVENTIONS: Three prevention strategies were evaluated, including universal decolonization, targeted decolonization, and screening and isolation. Because prevention strategies have a screening component, the screening test in the model was varied to reflect commonly used screening test categories, including conventional culture, chromogenic agar, and polymerase chain reaction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Universal and targeted decolonization are less costly and more effective than screening and isolation. This is consistent for all screening tests. When compared with targeted decolonization, universal decolonization is cost-saving to cost-effective, with maximum cost savings occurring when a hospital uses more expensive screening tests like polymerase chain reaction.

16983,"Acute care surgery: a means for providing cost-effective, quality care for gallstone pancreatitis","BACKGROUND: Modern practice guidelines recommend index cholecystectomy (IC) for patients admitted with gallstone pancreatitis (GSP). However, this benchmark has been difficult to widely achieve. Previous work has demonstrated that dedicated acute care surgery (ACS) services can facilitate IC. However, the associated financial costs and economic effectiveness of this intervention are unknown and represent potential barriers to ACS adoption. We investigated the impact of an ACS service at two hospitals before and after implementation on cost effectiveness, patient quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and impact on rates of IC. METHODS: All patients admitted with non-severe GSP to two tertiary care teaching hospitals from January 2008-May 2015 were reviewed. The diagnosis of GSP was confirmed upon review of clinical, biochemical and radiographic criteria. Patients were divided into three time periods based on the presence of ACS (none, at one hospital, at both hospitals). Data were collected regarding demographics, cholecystectomy timing, resource utilization, and associated costs. QALY analyses were performed and incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated comparing pre-ACS to post-ACS periods. RESULTS: In 435 patients admitted for GSP, IC increased from 16 to 76% after implementing an ACS service at both hospitals. There was a significant reduction in admissions and emergency room visits for GSP after introduction of ACS services (p < 0.001). There was no difference in length of stay or conversion to an open operation. The implementation of the ACS service was associated with a decrease in cost of $1162 per patient undergoing cholecystectomy, representing a 12.6% savings.

16986,The Cost-Effectiveness of Dual Mobility Implants for Primary Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Computer-Based Cost-Utility Model,"BACKGROUND: Dislocation remains a clinically important problem following primary total hip arthroplasty, and it is a common reason for revision total hip arthroplasty. Dual mobility (DM) implants decrease the risk of dislocation but can be more expensive than conventional implants and have idiosyncratic failure mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of DM implants compared with conventional bearings for primary total hip arthroplasty. METHODS: Markov model analysis was conducted from the societal perspective with use of direct and indirect costs. Costs, expressed in 2013 U.S. dollars, were derived from the literature, the National Inpatient Sample, and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The model was populated with health state utilities and state transition probabilities derived from previously published literature. The analysis was performed for a patient''s lifetime, and costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3% annually. The principal outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed to explore relevant uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base case, DM total hip arthroplasty showed absolute dominance over conventional total hip arthroplasty, with lower accrued costs ($39,008 versus $40,031 U.S. dollars) and higher accrued utility (13.18 versus 13.13 QALYs) indicating cost-savings. DM total hip arthroplasty ceased being cost-saving when its implant costs exceeded those of conventional total hip arthroplasty by $1,023, and the cost-effectiveness threshold for DM implants was $5,287 greater than that for conventional implants. DM was not cost-effective when the annualized incremental probability of revision from any unforeseen failure mechanism or mechanisms exceeded 0.29%. The probability of intraprosthetic dislocation exerted the most influence on model results. CONCLUSIONS: This model determined that, compared with conventional bearings, DM implants can be cost-saving for routine primary total hip arthroplasty, from the societal perspective, if newer-generation DM implants meet specific economic and clinical benchmarks. The differences between these thresholds and the performance of other contemporary bearings were frequently quite narrow. The results have potential application to the postmarket surveillance of newer-generation DM components. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and decision analysis Level III.

However, the attendant cost of surgery and the quality-of-life benefit of a surgical treatment strategy are unclear. PURPOSE: To compare the cost-utility of 3 management strategies for acute first-time patellar dislocations in adolescents: (1) nonoperative treatment only, (2) initial nonoperative treatment with surgery only for recurrent dislocations, and (3) immediate surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Economic and decision analysis; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A 10-year state-transition Markov model was constructed to compare the cost-utility of the 3 index treatment protocols. Utilities used to define health states were derived from a telephone interview of 60 adolescents with a history of acute patellar dislocations. The probability of transition between each health state was informed by the available literature. Direct costs were estimated using a statewide ambulatory surgery database, and indirect costs were estimated based on parental lost productivity. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The principal outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In the base case for our model, nonoperative treatment only was the least costly ($7300) but also the least effective (5.30 QALYs); initial nonoperative treatment with delayed surgery cost $10,500 for a 5.93 QALY benefit, while immediate surgical treatment cost $17,100 and provided 6.32 QALY benefits. Compared with nonoperative treatment only, initial nonoperative treatment with delayed surgery was associated with an ICER of $5100 per QALY. When immediate surgery was compared with a strategy of delayed surgery, immediate surgery provided incremental benefits at an ICER of $17,000 per QALY. The model was sensitive to the probability of surgical versus nonoperative treatment to achieve a full return to preinjury activity versus an intermediate lower state. When the probability of achieving a full return to preinjury activity with initial nonoperative treatment exceeds 47.5% (compared with 34.2% in the base case), then initial nonoperative treatment with delayed surgery is preferred to immediate surgery. Similarly, when the probability of achieving a full return to full preinjury activity with surgery falls below 51% (compared with 64% in the base case), then delayed surgery after initial nonoperative treatment is preferred. CONCLUSION: Immediate surgery and delayed surgical treatment are both cost-effective treatment options; however, immediate surgical treatment provides the highest QALY gains within a 10-year time horizon.

16989,Cost-effectiveness of gastric band surgery for overweight but not obese adults with type 2 diabetes in the U.S,"AIM: To determine the cost-effectiveness of gastric band surgery in overweight but not obese people who receive standard diabetes care. METHOD: A microsimulation model (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study outcomes model) was used to project diabetes outcomes and costs from a two-year Australian randomized trial of gastric band (GB) surgery in overweight but not obese people (BMI 25 to 30kg/m2) on to a comparable population of U.S. adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (N=254). Estimates of cost-effectiveness were calculated based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for different treatment scenarios. Costs were inflated to 2015 U.S. dollar values and an ICER of less than $50,000 per QALY gained was considered cost-effective. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for GB surgery at two years exceeded $90,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained but decreased to $52,000, $29,000 and $22,000 when the health benefits of surgery were assumed to endure for 5, 10 and 15 years respectively. The cost-effectiveness of GB surgery was sensitive to utility gained from weight loss and, to a lesser degree, the costs of GB surgery. However, the cost-effectiveness of GB surgery was affected minimally by improvements in HbA1c, systolic blood pressure and cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: GB surgery for overweight but not obese people with T2D appears to be cost-effective in the U.S. setting if weight loss endures for more than five years. Health utility gained from weight loss is a critical input to cost-effectiveness estimates and therefore should be routinely measured in populations undergoing bariatric surgery.",2017-01-23246,28462893,J Diabetes Complications,John M Wentworth,2017,/,,No,28462893,"John M Wentworth; Kim M Dalziel; Paul E O'Brien; Paul Burton; Frackson Shaba; Philip M Clarke; Neda Laiteerapong; Wendy A Brown; Cost-effectiveness of gastric band surgery for overweight but not obese adults with type 2 diabetes in the U.S, J Diabetes Complications, 2017 Apr 13; ():1873-460X",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Gastric band surgery + usual care vs. Standard/Usual Care,Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) of less than 5 years' duration and a BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m^2,65 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"10 Years, 5 and 15 years",3.00,3.00,29007,United States,2015,31674.23

Botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) is effective in treating CD but little is known about its associated cost-effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abobotulinumtoxinA for treating CD from the UK payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of abobotulinum-toxinA versus best supportive care (BSC) in CD, with a lifetime horizon and health states for response, nonresponse, secondary nonresponse, and BSC in patients with CD (mean age: 53 years; 37% male). Clinical improvement measured using Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) was mapped to utility using data from a randomized trial of abobotulinumtoxinA. Health care resource use, costs, and other inputs were from the British National Formulary, Personal Social Services Research Unit, published literature, or expert opinion. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained from abobotulinumtoxinA arm versus BSC was 0.253 per patient, whereas the incremental cost was pound7,160, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound30,468 per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that these results were sensitive to the proportion of responders to abobotulinumtoxinA at first injection, duration between injections, the number of reinjections allowed among primary nonresponders, and any difference in baseline TWSTRS value between the BSC and abobotulinumtoxinA arms.

16992,Cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation versus treatment as usual for obsessive-compulsive disorder,"BACKGROUND: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is effective for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but requires expensive medical procedures. To date, no study has examined the cost-effectiveness of DBS for OCD. OBJECTIVE: To perform the first economic evaluation of DBS for therapy refractory OCD. METHODS: We conducted a 2-year prospective, open cost-effectiveness study, comparing DBS (n = 17) with treatment as usual (TAU) (n = 11), with cost per Quality-Adjusted-Life-Year (QALY) as outcome measure. Apart from the base-case, or primary analysis, we conducted two practice-based scenarios: (1) standard care scenario, without research and innovation costs, and (2) rechargeable scenario, in which we assume the use of a rechargeable battery. Base-case and both scenarios were extrapolated to four years to estimate long-term cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Compared to TAU, DBS provides an additional 0.26 QALY (SD = 0.16). Median cost per QALY gained is estimated at euro141,446 for base-case, euro115,916 for standard care and euro65,394 for the rechargeable scenario. Extending the time-horizon to four years results in a median cost per QALY of euro80,313 for base-case, euro69,287 for standard care, and turned out to be cost-saving at euro4678 per QALY for the rechargeable scenario. Assuming a willingness to pay threshold of euro80,000/QALY, DBS, under base-case and standard care had 25% and 35% probability of being more cost-effective than TAU. With the rechargeable scenario and in all scenarios extrapolated to four years, the probability of cost-effectiveness was equal or higher than TAU.

16993,Corneal Collagen Cross-Linking in the Management of Keratoconus in Canada: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"PURPOSE: To use patient-level microsimulation models to evaluate the comparative cost-effectiveness of early corneal cross-linking (CXL) and conventional management with penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) when indicated in managing keratoconus in Canada. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using individual-based, state-transition microsimulation models. PARTICIPANTS: Simulated cohorts of 100 000 individuals with keratoconus who entered each treatment arm at 25 years of age. Fellow eyes were modeled separately. Simulated individuals lived up to a maximum of 110 years. METHODS: We developed 2 state-transition microsimulation models to reflect the natural history of keratoconus progression and the impact of conventional management with PKP versus CXL. We collected data from the published literature to inform model parameters. We used realistic parameters that maximized the potential costs and complications of CXL, while minimizing those associated with PKP. In each treatment arm, we allowed simulated individuals to move through health states in monthly cycles from diagnosis until death. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For each treatment strategy, we calculated the total cost and number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Costs were measured in Canadian dollars. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 5%, converting future costs and QALYs into present values. We used an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER = difference in lifetime costs/difference in lifetime health outcomes) to compare the cost-effectiveness of CXL versus conventional management with PKP. RESULTS: Lifetime costs and QALYs for CXL were estimated to be Can$5530 (Can$4512, discounted) and 50.12 QALYs (16.42 QALYs, discounted). Lifetime costs and QALYs for conventional management with PKP were Can$2675 (Can$1508, discounted) and 48.93 QALYs (16.09 QALYs, discounted). The discounted ICER comparing CXL to conventional management was Can$9090/QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses revealed that in general, parameter variations did not influence the cost-effectiveness of CXL. CONCLUSIONS: CXL is cost-effective compared with conventional management with PKP in the treatment of keratoconus. Our ICER of Can$9090/QALY falls well below the range of Can$20 000 to Can$100 000/QALY and below US$50 000/QALY, thresholds generally used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of health interventions in Canada and the United States.

16994,Cost effectiveness of a targeted age-based West Nile virus vaccination program,"BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of domestically-acquired arboviral disease in the United States. Several WNV vaccines are in various stages of development. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of WNV vaccination programs targeting groups at increased risk for severe WNV disease. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to estimate costs and health outcomes of vaccination with WNV vaccine compared to no vaccination among seven cohorts, spaced at 10year intervals from ages 10 to 70years, each followed until 90-years-old. U.S. surveillance data were used to estimate WNV neuroinvasive disease incidence. Data for WNV seroprevalence, acute and long-term care costs of WNV disease patients, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and vaccine characteristics were obtained from published reports. We assumed vaccine efficacy to either last lifelong or for 10years with booster doses given every 10years. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in cost-effectiveness ratios across cohorts in both models and all outcomes assessed (Kruskal-Wallis test p<0.0001). The 60-year-cohort had a mean cost per neuroinvasive disease case prevented of $664,000 and disability averted of $1,421,000 in lifelong model and $882,000 and $1,887,000, respectively in 10-year immunity model; these costs were statistically significantly lower than costs for other cohorts (p<0.0001). Vaccinating 70-year-olds had the lowest cost per death averted in both models at around $4.7 million (95%CI $2-$8 million).

The 60-year-cohort had a mean cost per neuroinvasive disease case prevented of $664,000 and disability averted of $1,421,000 in lifelong model and $882,000 and $1,887,000, respectively in 10-year immunity model; these costs were statistically significantly lower than costs for other cohorts (p<0.0001). Vaccinating 70-year-olds had the lowest cost per death averted in both models at around $4.7 million (95%CI $2-$8 million). Cost per disease case averted was lowest among 40- and 50-year-old cohorts and cost per QALY saved lowest among 60-year cohorts in lifelong immunity model. The models were most sensitive to disease incidence, vaccine cost, and proportion of persons developing disease among infected. CONCLUSIONS: Age-based WNV vaccination program targeting those at higher risk for severe disease is more cost-effective than universal vaccination.

17000,Cost effectiveness of a targeted age-based West Nile virus vaccination program,"BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of domestically-acquired arboviral disease in the United States. Several WNV vaccines are in various stages of development. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of WNV vaccination programs targeting groups at increased risk for severe WNV disease. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to estimate costs and health outcomes of vaccination with WNV vaccine compared to no vaccination among seven cohorts, spaced at 10year intervals from ages 10 to 70years, each followed until 90-years-old. U.S. surveillance data were used to estimate WNV neuroinvasive disease incidence. Data for WNV seroprevalence, acute and long-term care costs of WNV disease patients, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and vaccine characteristics were obtained from published reports. We assumed vaccine efficacy to either last lifelong or for 10years with booster doses given every 10years. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in cost-effectiveness ratios across cohorts in both models and all outcomes assessed (Kruskal-Wallis test p<0.0001). The 60-year-cohort had a mean cost per neuroinvasive disease case prevented of $664,000 and disability averted of $1,421,000 in lifelong model and $882,000 and $1,887,000, respectively in 10-year immunity model; these costs were statistically significantly lower than costs for other cohorts (p<0.0001).
