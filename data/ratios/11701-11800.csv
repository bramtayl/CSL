11701,Cost effectiveness of denosumab versus oral bisphosphonates for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the US,"BACKGROUND: In the US, 26 % of women aged >/=65 years, and over 50 % of women aged >/=85 years are affected with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO). Each year, the total direct health care costs are estimated to be $US12-18 billion. OBJECTIVE: The cost effectiveness of denosumab versus oral bisphosphonates in postmenopausal osteoporotic women from a US third-party payer perspective was evaluated. METHODS: A lifetime cohort Markov model was developed with seven health states: ''well'', hip fracture, vertebral fracture, ''other'' osteoporotic fracture, post-hip fracture, post-vertebral fracture, and dead. During each cycle, patients could have a fracture, remain healthy, remain in a post-fracture state or die. Relative fracture risk reductions, background fracture risks, mortality rates, treatment-specific persistence rate, utilities, and medical and drug costs were derived using published sources. Expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated for generic alendronate, denosumab, branded risedronate, and branded ibandronate in the overall PMO population and high-risk subgroups: (a) >/=2 of the following risks: >70 years of age, bone mineral density (BMD) T score less than or equal to -3.0, and prevalent vertebral fracture; and (b) >/=75 years of age. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3 % annually, and all costs were inflated to 2012 US dollars. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by varying parameters e.g., efficacies of interventions, costs, utilities, and the medication persistence ratio. RESULTS: In the overall PMO population, total lifetime costs for alendronate, denosumab, risedronate, and ibandronate were $US64,400, $US67,400, $US67,600 and $US69,200, respectively. Total QALYs were 8.2804, 8.3155, 8.2735 and 8.2691, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for denosumab versus generic alendronate was $US85,100/QALY. Risedronate and ibandronate were dominated by denosumab. In the high-risk subgroup (a), total costs for alendronate, denosumab, risedronate and ibandronate were $US70,400, $US70,800, $US74,000 and $US76,900, respectively. Total QALYs were 7.2006, 7.2497, 7.1969 and 7.1841, respectively. Denosumab had an ICER of $US7,900/QALY versus generic alendronate and dominated all other strategies. Denosumab dominated all strategies in women aged >/=75 years. Base-case results between denosumab and generic alendronate were most sensitive to the relative risk of hip fracture for both drugs and the cost of denosumab. CONCLUSION: In each PMO population examined, denosumab represented good value for money compared with branded bisphosphonates.

11703,Cost-utility analysis of deferiprone for the treatment of beta-thalassaemia patients with chronic iron overload: a UK perspective,"BACKGROUND: Patients with beta-thalassaemia major experience chronic iron overload due to regular blood transfusions. Chronic iron overload can be treated using iron-chelating therapies such as desferrioxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP) and deferasirox (DFX) monotherapy, or DFO-DFP combination therapy. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the relative cost effectiveness of these regimens over a 5-year timeframe from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective, including personal and social services. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the treatment regimens over 5 years. Based on published randomized controlled trial evidence, it was assumed that all four treatment regimens had a comparable effect on serum ferritin concentration (SFC) and liver iron concentration (LIC), and that DFP was more effective for reducing cardiac morbidity and mortality. Published utility scores for route of administration were used, with subcutaneously administered DFO assumed to incur a greater quality of life (QoL) burden than the oral chelators DFP and DFX. Healthcare resource use, drug costs (2010/2011 costs), and utilities associated with adverse events were also considered, with the effect of varying all parameters assessed in sensitivity analysis. Incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated for each treatment, with cost effectiveness expressed as incremental cost per QALY. Assumptions that DFP conferred no cardiac morbidity, mortality, or morbidity and mortality benefit were also explored in scenario analysis. RESULTS: DFP was the dominant strategy in all scenarios modelled, providing greater QALY gains at a lower cost. Sensitivity analysis showed that DFP dominated all other treatments unless the QoL burden associated with the route of administration was greater for DFP than for DFO, which is unlikely to be the case. DFP had >99 % likelihood of being cost effective against all comparators at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, DFP appeared to be the most cost-effective treatment available for managing chronic iron overload in beta-thalassaemia patients.

11706,Cost-utility analysis for platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer therapy in South Korea: results of the polyethylene glycolated liposomal doxorubicin/carboplatin sequencing model,"OBJECTIVE: We performed a cost-utility analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of a chemotherapy sequence including a combination of polyethylene glycolated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)/carboplatin versus paclitaxel/carboplatin as a second-line treatment in women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed with a 10-year time horizon. The treatment sequence consisted of first- to sixth-line chemotherapies and best supportive care (BSC) before death. Cycle length, a time interval for efficacy evaluation of chemotherapy, was 9 weeks. The model consisted of four health states: responsive, progressive, clinical remission, and death. At any given time, a patient may have remained on a current therapy or made a transition to the next therapy or death. Median time to progressions and overall survivals data were obtained through a systematic literature review and were pooled using a meta-analytical approach. If unavailable, this was elicited from an expert panel (eg, BSC). These outcomes were converted to transition probabilities using an appropriate formula. Direct costs included drug-acquisition costs for chemotherapies, premedication, adverse-event treatment and monitoring, efficacy evaluation, BSC, drug administration, and follow-up tests during remission. Indirect costs were transportation expenses. Utilities were also derived from the literature. Costs and utilities were discounted at an annual rate of 5% per cycle. RESULTS: PLD/carboplatin combination as the second line in the sequence is more effective and costly than paclitaxel/carboplatin combination, showing an additional US$21,658 per quality-adjusted life years. This result was robust in a deterministic sensitivity analysis except when median time to progression of second-line therapies and administration cost of PLD/carboplatin per administration cycle were varied. The probability of cost-effectiveness for PLD/carboplatin combination was 49.4% at a willingness to pay $20,000. CONCLUSION: A PLD/carboplatin combination is an economically valuable option as second-line chemotherapy for the treatment of platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer in South Korea.",2013-01-11687,23869171,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Hwa-Young Lee,2013,5 /,297-307,No,23869171,"Hwa-Young Lee; Bong-Min Yang; Ji-Min Hong; Tae-Jin Lee; Byoung-Gie Kim; Jae-Weon Kim; Young-Tae Kim; Yong-Man Kim; Sokbom Kang; Cost-utility analysis for platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer therapy in South Korea: results of the polyethylene glycolated liposomal doxorubicin/carboplatin sequencing model, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 5():1178-6981; 297-307",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Not Stated,Polyethylene glycolated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD)/carboplatin vs. Paclitaxel/carboplatin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,21658,United States,2011,24919.33
11707,A standardized vascular disease health check in europe: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: No clinical trials have assessed the effects or cost-effectiveness of health check strategies to detect and manage vascular disease. We used a mathematical model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of several health check strategies in six European countries. METHODS: We used country-specific data from Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom to generate simulated populations of individuals aged 40-75 eligible for health checks in those countries (e.g. individuals without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or serious chronic kidney disease). For each country, we used the Archimedes model to compare seven health check strategies consisting of assessments for diabetes, hypertension, lipids, and smoking. For patients diagnosed with vascular disease, treatment was simulated in a standard manner. We calculated the effects of each strategy on the incidence of type 2 diabetes, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and microvascular complications in addition to quality of life, costs, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Compared with current care, health checks reduced the incidence of MACE (6-17 events prevented per 1000 people screened) and diabetes related microvasular complications (5-11 events prevented per 1000 people screened), and increased QALYs (31-59 discounted QALYs) over 30 years, in all countries. The cost per QALY of offering a health check to all individuals in the study cohort ranged from euro14903 (France) to cost saving (Poland). Pre-screening the population and offering health checks only to higher risk individuals lowered the cost per QALY. Pre-screening on the basis of obesity had a cost per QALY of euro10200 (France) or less, and pre-screening with a non-invasive risk score was similar.

RESULTS: Compared with current care, health checks reduced the incidence of MACE (6-17 events prevented per 1000 people screened) and diabetes related microvasular complications (5-11 events prevented per 1000 people screened), and increased QALYs (31-59 discounted QALYs) over 30 years, in all countries. The cost per QALY of offering a health check to all individuals in the study cohort ranged from euro14903 (France) to cost saving (Poland). Pre-screening the population and offering health checks only to higher risk individuals lowered the cost per QALY. Pre-screening on the basis of obesity had a cost per QALY of euro10200 (France) or less, and pre-screening with a non-invasive risk score was similar.

11712,A standardized vascular disease health check in europe: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: No clinical trials have assessed the effects or cost-effectiveness of health check strategies to detect and manage vascular disease. We used a mathematical model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of several health check strategies in six European countries. METHODS: We used country-specific data from Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the United Kingdom to generate simulated populations of individuals aged 40-75 eligible for health checks in those countries (e.g. individuals without a previous diagnosis of diabetes, myocardial infarction, stroke, or serious chronic kidney disease). For each country, we used the Archimedes model to compare seven health check strategies consisting of assessments for diabetes, hypertension, lipids, and smoking. For patients diagnosed with vascular disease, treatment was simulated in a standard manner. We calculated the effects of each strategy on the incidence of type 2 diabetes, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), and microvascular complications in addition to quality of life, costs, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

11713,Cost-effectiveness of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia in lymphoma patients,"BACKGROUND: Febrile neutropenia is a serious toxicity of cancer chemotherapy that is usually treated in hospital. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: We used a Markov model that followed patients through induction chemotherapy to compare the three prophylaxis strategies: 1) no primary prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia; 2) primary prophylaxis with 10 days of filgrastim therapy; and 3) primary prophylaxis with a single dose of pegfilgrastim. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 64-year-old men and women with DLBCL. Data sources included published literature and current clinical practice. The analysis was conducted from a publicly funded health-care system perspective. The main outcome measures included costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, costs associated with no primary prophylaxis, primary prophylaxis with 10 days of filgrastim, and primary prophylaxis with pegfilgrastim were CaD $7314, CaD $13947, and CaD $16290, respectively. The QALYs associated with the three strategies were 0.2004, 0.2015, and 0.2024, respectively. The ICER for the filgrastim vs no primary prophylaxis strategy was CaD $5796000 per QALY. The ICER for the pegfilgrastim vs filgrastim primary prophylaxis strategy was CaD $2611000 per QALY. All one-way sensitivity analyses yielded ICERs greater than CaD $400000 per QALY. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves show that 20.0% of iterations are cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of CaD $1595000 for the filgrastim strategy and CaD $561000 for the pegfilgrastim strategy.

11715,Cost-effectiveness of bazedoxifene versus raloxifene in the treatment of postmenopausal women in Spain,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of bazedoxifene and raloxifene for prevention of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures among postmenopausal Spanish women aged 55-82 years with established osteoporosis and a high fracture risk. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to represent the transition of a cohort of postmenopausal osteoporotic women through different health states, ie, patients free of fractures, patients with vertebral or nonvertebral fractures, and patients recovered from a fracture. Efficacy data for bazedoxifene were obtained from the Osteoporosis Study. The perspective of the Spanish National Health Service was chosen with a time horizon of 27 years. Costs were reported in 2010 Euros. Deterministic results were presented as expected cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and probabilistic results were represented in cost-effectiveness planes. RESULTS: In deterministic analysis, the expected cost per patient was higher in the raloxifene cohort (euro13,881) than in the bazedoxifene cohort (euro13,436). QALYs gained were slightly higher in the bazedoxifene cohort (14.56 versus 14.54). Results from probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that bazedoxifene has a slightly higher probability of being cost-effective for all threshold values independent of the maximum that the National Health Service is willing to pay per additional QALY.

11716,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of measuring fecal calprotectin in diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease in adults and children,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: The level of fecal calprotectin (FC) can predict the onset of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with high accuracy and precision. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of using measurements of FC to identify adults and children who require endoscopic confirmation of IBD. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic tree to compare the cost-effectiveness of measuring FC before endoscopy examination with that of direct endoscopic evaluation alone. A second decision analytic tree was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FC cutoff levels of 100 mug/g vs 50 mug/g (typically used to screen for intestinal inflammation). The primary outcome measure was the incremental cost required to avoid 1 false-negative result by using FC level to diagnose new-onset IBD. RESULTS: In adults, FC screening saved $417/patient but delayed diagnosis for 2.2/32 patients with IBD among 100 screened patients. In children, FC screening saved $300/patient but delayed diagnosis for 4.8/61 patients with IBD among 100 screened patients. If endoscopic biopsy analysis remained the standard for diagnosis, direct endoscopic evaluation would cost an additional $18,955 in adults and $6250 in children to avoid 1 false-negative result from FC screening. Sensitivity analyses showed that cost-effectiveness of FC screening varied with the sensitivity of the test and the pre-test probability of IBD in adults and children. Pre-test probabilities for IBD of </=75% in adults and </=65% in children made FC screening cost-effective, but it was cost-ineffective if the probabilities were >/=85% and >/=78% in adults and children, respectively. Compared with the FC cutoff level of 100 mug/g, the cutoff level of 50 mug/g cost an additional $55 and $43 for adults and children, respectively, but it yielded 2.4 and 6.1 additional accurate diagnoses of IBD per 100 screened adults and children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening adults and children to measure fecal levels of calprotectin is effective and cost-effective in identifying those with IBD on a per-case basis when the pre-test probability is </=75% for adults and </=65% for children.

METHODS: Markov decision analysis was conducted from a societal perspective to compare the relative costs and effectiveness of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis versus no anticoagulation during ambulatory IBD flares among a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 IBD patients. The time horizon was from time of IBD diagnosis until death. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In base case analysis, VTE prophylaxis was, compared with no anticoagulation, associated with higher average costs (U.S. $141,036 versus $90,338) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (22.29 versus 22.25), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,267,450/QALY. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis resulted in higher unadjusted life-years (47.76 life-years versus 46.67 life-years) and lower lifetime risk of VTE (6.2% versus 9.3%). The number needed to treat to prevent one VTE event over a lifetime was 32.3. Univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was most sensitive to variations in the efficacy of VTE prophylaxis. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, only 20% of 1000 simulated trials showed that VTE prophylaxis increased QALYs. In the remaining 80%, it was associated with both higher costs and fewer QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: Although the administration of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis during IBD flares in the outpatient setting was associated with increased life-years and reduced VTE events, it was not cost effective. Moreover, the benefits of VTE prophylaxis were not robust to probabilistic sensitivity analysis.",2013-01-11711,23883960,Inflamm Bowel Dis,Geoffrey C Nguyen,2013,19 / 10,,No,23883960,"Geoffrey C Nguyen; Suraj Sharma; Feasibility of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis during inflammatory bowel disease flares in the outpatient setting: a decision analysis, Inflamm Bowel Dis, 2013 Sep; 19(10):1536-4844",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pharmacological venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis with low-molecular weight heparin over 4 months + standard therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- without anticoagulation,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,1267450,United States,2012,1428739.44
11723,Cost-effectiveness analysis of solifenacin versus oxybutynin immediate-release in the treatment of patients with overactive bladder in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: To carry out a cost-utility analysis comparing initial treatment with solifenacin 5 mg/day vs oxybutynin immediate-release (IR) 15 mg/day for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder (OAB) from the perspective of the U.K. National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A Markov model with six health states was developed to follow a cohort of OAB patients treated with either solifenacin or oxybutynin during a 1-year period. Costs and utilities were accumulated as patients transited through the health states in the model and a drop-out state. Some of the solifenacin patients were titrated from 5 mg to 10 mg/day at 8 weeks. A proportion of drop-out patients were assumed to continue treatment with tolterodine ER. Utility values were obtained from a Swedish study and pad use was based on a multinational clinical trial. Adherence rates for individual treatments were derived from a U.K. database study. For pad use and utility values, the drop-out state was split between those patients who were no longer receiving treatment and those on second-line therapy. Patients on second-line therapy who drop-out were referred for a specialist visit. Results were expressed in terms of incremental cost-utility ratios. RESULTS: Total annual costs for solifenacin and oxybutynin were pound504.30 and pound364.19, respectively. First-line drug use represents 49% and 4% of costs and pad use represent 23% and 40% of costs for solifenacin and oxybutynin, respectively. Differences between cumulative utilities were small but were greater for solifenacin (0.7020 vs. 0.6907). The baseline incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound12,309/QALY. CONCLUSION: Under the baseline assumptions, solifenacin would appear to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-utility of less than pound20,000/QALY. However, small differences in utility between the alternatives and the large number of drop-outs means that the results are sensitive to small adjustments in the values of utilities assigned to the drop-out state.",2013-01-11713,23885660,J Med Econ,Warren Mark Hart,2013,16 / 10,,Yes,23885660,"Warren Mark Hart; Paul Abrams; Vicki Munro; Peny Retsa; Jameel Nazir; Cost-effectiveness analysis of solifenacin versus oxybutynin immediate-release in the treatment of patients with overactive bladder in the United Kingdom, J Med Econ, 2013 Oct; 16(10):1369-6998",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Solifenacin 5 mg/day, With incontinence pads vs. Oxybutynin 15 mg/day",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,12309,United Kingdom,2010,22554.05

11730,Cost-effectiveness of questionnaires in preventing transfusion-transmitted infections,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of the donor health questionnaire (DHQ) as a tool to assess donor eligibility has not been quantified. This study focused on cost-effectiveness of the DHQ in preventing transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data on whole blood donor eligibility assessments in the Netherlands in 2008 to 2010 were analyzed. Based on test results and epidemiologic data on TTIs, the number of donor visits in their window phase was calculated. Subsequently, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the DHQ was calculated. RESULTS: The overall annual deferral rate in the study period was 9.6% (9.3%-10.0%). The annual deferral rate for TTI risk was 0.86% (0.82%-0.89%). Taking into account the number of self-deferrals, deferral rate for TTI risk in all donors was 1.90% (1.81%-2.02%). The calculated annual numbers of prevented cases of TTI were hepatitis B, 0.142; hepatitis C, 0.010; human immunodeficiency virus, 0.016; and syphilis, 0.135. The annual costs for TTI risk-related eligibility assessments, deferrals, and substitutions were euro84,807 (euro55,193-euro123,811) for the blood establishment (BE) and euro90,501 (euro46,965-euro159,571) for deferred donors. Annual savings were euro991 (euro276-euro2325), while annual quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were 0.120 (0.059-0.226). Hence, the ICER for the DHQ on preventing TTIs was euro696,744 (euro315,422-euro1,611,681) for BE costs only and euro1,449,055 (euro669,439-euro3,145,961) including costs for deferred donors. CONCLUSION: The DHQ enhances self-selection and should not be abandoned. However, the DHQ is not a cost-effective tool for further reducing TTIs. The high costs per case prevented and the small number of QALYs gained argue against maintaining deferral policy through the DHQ at the current level.",2013-01-11718,23889559,Transfusion,Wim de Kort,2014,54 / 3 Pt 2,,No,23889559,"Wim de Kort; Peter van den Burg; Herman Geerligs; Pieternel Pasker-de Jong; Tanneke Marijt-van der Kreek; Cost-effectiveness of questionnaires in preventing transfusion-transmitted infections, Transfusion, ; 54(3 Pt 2):0041-1132",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Donor health questionnaire (DHQ) for preventing transfusion-transmitted infections vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,696744,Euro,2011,1115574.91

The clinical parameters are based on the results of the RE-LY trial, which compared dabigatran with warfarin, and on a meta-analysis that estimated the risk of each event in patients treated with aspirin or with no antithrombotic therapy.Dabigatran provides an increase of 0.331 life years and 0.354 quality-adjusted life years for each patient. From a societal perspective, these clinical gains entail an additional expenditure of 2978 euros. Thus, the incremental cost is 9006 euros per life year gained and 8409 euros per quality-adjusted life year.The results show that dabigatran reduces the number of events, especially the most severe such as ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, as well as their long-term sequelae.

11733,Cost-effectiveness of 12-month treatment with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel in the management of acute coronary syndromes,"BACKGROUND: The PLATO (Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes) randomized trial (NCT00391872) in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) reported that ticagrelor (in addition to aspirin) reduced the rate of the composite end point of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or cardiovascular death compared with clopidogrel (in addition to aspirin) by 16% over 12 months (P < 0.001). No significant difference in the incidence of major bleeding was noted, but ticagrelor was associated with a higher rate of major bleeding not related to coronary artery bypass grafting. OBJECTIVE: By extrapolating the key findings of PLATO, we sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel in the management of ACS in a contemporary Australian setting. METHODS: A Markov model with 4 health states (free from further ACS events, MI, stroke, and death) was developed to simulate the long-term costs and outcomes associated with ACS. Event risks were based on data derived directly from PLATO, and costs and utilities were drawn from published sources. A 10-year time horizon was simulated, and future costs and benefits were discounted at a 5% annual rate. However, treatment with ticagrelor and clopidogrel was only assumed for the first 12 months, with no benefits applied beyond drug cessation. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken based on variations to key data inputs. All costs for resource use applied in the analysis were based on published Australian prices (in 2010/2011 dollars [A$]). RESULTS: Over 10 years, the estimated quality-adjusted life-years lived per-patient were 5.74 and 5.68 for ticagrelor and clopidogrel, respectively. Net costs were A$19,132 for ticagrelor and A$18,428 for clopidogrel.

11734,Unmet HIV service needs among Black men who have sex with men in the United States,"The National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) clearly emphasized the need to provide services to black men who have sex with men (MSM). However, there are no estimates of the unmet HIV-related service delivery needs among black MSM. We estimate that of 195,313 black MSM living with HIV in the US, 50,196 were not yet diagnosed, and 145,118 were aware of their seropositivity (of whom 67,625 were not linked to care and 77,493 were linked to care). Also, of those already diagnosed, ~43,390 had undetectable viral load and 101,728 had detectable viral load. Approximately 19,545 of diagnosed black MSM engage in unprotected risk behavior in serostatus-discordant partnerships. The cost of delivering services needed to meet the NHAS goals is ~$2.475 billion in 2011 U.S. dollars. Mathematical modeling suggests that provisions of these services would avert 6213 HIV infections at an economically favorable cost of $20,032 per quality-adjusted life year saved.",2013-01-11724,23892769,AIDS Behav,David R Holtgrave,2014,18 / 1,,No,23892769,"David R Holtgrave; J Janet Kim; Chris Adkins; Cathy Maulsby; Kali D Lindsey; Kim M Johnson; Daniel C Montoya; Robin T Kelley; Unmet HIV service needs among Black men who have sex with men in the United States, AIDS Behav, 2014 Jan; 18(1):1573-3254",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Provision of HIV-related services to black men who have sex with men (MSM) (diagnostic services, treatment costs, prevention services, housing and related services for homeless) vs. None",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,20032,United Kingdom,2011,36976.72
11735,Economic evaluation of HLA-B*15:02 screening for carbamazepine-induced severe adverse drug reactions in Thailand,"PURPOSE: There is strong evidence of an association between the presence of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*15:02 and two severe adverse drug reactions-Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)-in patients taking carbamazepine (CBZ), a common treatment for patients with epilepsy and neuropathic pain. As a result, there are calls for all patients that are due to undergo CBZ therapy to be screened for this genetic marker before commencing their therapy. This study aims to determine the value for money of HLA-B*15:02 screening compared to the following: (1) administering CBZ therapy without conducting patient screening, and (2) not prescribing CBZ but alternative drugs that are less likely to result in severe reactions, but that come at a higher cost. METHOD: An economic evaluation was carried out by using a decision tree and Markov models to examine the cost-utility of providing HLA-B*15:02 screening for all patients with either newly diagnosed epilepsy or neuropathic pain in the Thai setting. All transitional probabilities were derived from the national and international literature. The majority of the data on direct medical care costs were collected from 10 community, provincial, and regional hospitals throughout Thailand. Direct non-medical cost and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data were obtained from interviews that were conducted with 33 patients, some of whom had experienced severe drug reactions. KEY FINDINGS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adopting a universal HLA-B*15:02 screening policy was estimated at 222,000 Thai baht, THB/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for epilepsy patients and 130,000 THB/QALY gained for patients with neuropathic pain. Furthermore, we found that 343 patients need to be tested for HLA-B*15:02 allele to prevent one case of SJS/TEN. SIGNIFICANCE: Universal HLA-B*15:02 screening represents good value for the money in terms of preventing SJS/TEN in CBZ-treated patients with neuropathic pain at the Thai ceiling ratio of 120,000 THB/QALY gained. However, the prevalence of CBZ-induced SJS/TEN in the Thai population and the positive predictive value (PPV) are major factors that influence the cost-effectiveness of HLA-B*15:02 screening.

11739,Respiratory syncytial virus immunization program for the United States: impact of performance determinants of a theoretical vaccine,"OBJECTIVES: To inform strategic decisions on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine development and identify critical endpoints likely to drive the vaccine''s medical and economic impact. DESIGN: A decision-analysis model populated using healthcare utilization data and costs from the literature; vaccine efficacy and duration based on assumptions. SETTING: Vaccination in the physician office setting in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: A hypothetical cohort of newborn infants. INTERVENTION: Vaccination of children at low and high risk of respiratory sequelae with a theoretical RSV vaccine vs palivizumab prophylaxis for children at high risk. OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical and economic value of RSV vaccination, including cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Using base-case assumptions (efficacy 50% at birth; half-life 12 months), RSV vaccination would prevent 23,069 hospitalizations and 66 deaths per vaccinated birth cohort in the USA. Excluding vaccination costs, direct medical costs for RSV would reduce by $236 million, and income and productivity losses by $134 million. Assuming a vaccine cost per course similar to Rotarix(R) in the USA ($232 including administration fees), the cost per QALY gained would be $93,401 (95% CI: $65,815-$126,060) from the healthcare system perspective and $65,115 (95% CI: $41,003-$93,679) from the societal perspective. The net cost (healthcare system perspective) per life-year saved would be $216,120 (95% CI: $161,184-$263,981); the cost per hospitalization averted would be $19,172 (95% CI: $14,679-$22,093). Aside from efficacy, the vaccine''s impact is sensitive to the start of protective immunity and the duration of protection. CONCLUSIONS: Development of an RSV vaccine would substantially reduce inpatient hospitalizations and outpatient visits. It would also have an impact on infant mortality. To demonstrate the full medical and economic value of the vaccine, appropriate endpoints or endpoint surrogates for hospitalization, mortality, and total case reductions should be collected during vaccine development.",2013-01-11732,23896421,Vaccine,Stephane A Regnier,2013,31 / 40,,Yes,23896421,"Stephane A Regnier; Respiratory syncytial virus immunization program for the United States: impact of performance determinants of a theoretical vaccine, Vaccine, 2013 Sep 13; 31(40):1873-2518",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,65115,United States,2011,74920.22
11740,Cost-effectiveness of 7-day-Holter monitoring alone or in combination with transthoracic echocardiography in patients with cerebral ischemia,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prolonged Holter monitoring of patients with cerebral ischemia increases the detection rate of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF); this leads to improved antithrombotic regimens aimed at preventing recurrent ischemic strokes. The aim of this study was to compare a 7-day-Holter monitoring (7-d-Holter) alone or in combination with prior selection via transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to a standard 24-h-Holter using a cost-utility analysis. METHODS: Lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were estimated for a cohort of patients with acute cerebral ischemia and no contraindication to oral anticoagulation. A Markov model was developed to simulate the long-term course and progression of cerebral ischemia considering the different diagnostic algorithms (24-h-Holter, 7-d-Holter, 7-d-Holter after preselection by TTE). Clinical data for these algorithms were derived from the prospective observational Find-AF study (ISRCTN 46104198). RESULTS: Predicted lifelong discounted costs were 33,837 <euro> for patients diagnosed by the 7-d-Holter and 33,852 <euro> by the standard 24-h-Holter. Cumulated QALYs were 3.868 for the 7-d-Holter compared to 3.844 for the 24-h-Holter.

11742,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a universal parenting skills programme in deprived communities: multicentre randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost utility of a universally provided early years parenting programme. DESIGN: Multicentre randomised controlled trial with cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Early years centres in four deprived areas of South Wales. PARTICIPANTS: Families with children aged between 2 and 4 years. 286 families were recruited and randomly allocated to the intervention or waiting list control. INTERVENTION: The Family Links Nurturing Programme (FLNP), a 10-week course with weekly 2 h facilitated group sessions. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Negative and supportive parenting, child and parental well-being and costs assessed before the intervention, following the course (3 months) and at 9 months using standardised measures. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in primary or secondary outcomes between trial arms at 3 or 9 months. With ''+'' indicating improvement, difference in change in negative parenting score at 9 months was +0.90 (95%CI -1.90 to 3.69); in supportive parenting, +0.17 (95%CI -0.61 to 0.94); and 12 of the 17 secondary outcomes showed a non-significant positive effect in the FLNP arm. Based on changes in parental well-being (SF-12), the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated to be pound34 913 (range 21 485-46 578) over 5 years and pound18 954 (range 11 664-25 287) over 10 years. Probability of cost per QALY gained below pound30 000 was 47% at 5 years and 57% at 10 years. Attendance was low: 34% of intervention families attended no sessions (n=48); only 47% completed the course (n=68). Also, 19% of control families attended a parenting programme before 9-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our trial has not found evidence of clinical or cost utility for the FLNP in a universal setting.

11743,Cost-effectiveness of biological therapy compared with methotrexate in the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in Colombia,"The objectives of the study are to develop a cost-effectiveness model comparing biological therapy (BT) with methotrexate (MTX) alone, in the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), combining clinical and quality-of-life data from international trials with local costs and local epidemiological data. We designed a six-month cycle Markov model with five functional states, based on Health Assessment Questionnaire, with patients initiating treatment in any of the predefined states, based on a sample of 150 local RA patients. Simulations ran for 10 and 20 years, and for the whole life span. Utilities, in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), were taken from international literature. Discount rate was 3 % for costs and utilities. We calculated direct and indirect costs using a combination of international and local data. Results are presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). ICERs in euros per QALY were <euro>143,072 for 10 years; <euro>139,332 for 20 years; and <euro>137,712 for the whole life span. Total costs with MTX were lower than with BT, despite higher out of pocket, productivity, and complication costs. Under conventional thresholds, and for the ""average"" RA patient, BT would not be cost-effective in Colombia. BT compared to MTX provides more QALYs, but at a high cost. When ICERs were estimated for Colombia, BT would not be cost-effective.

11744,Cost-effectiveness of a cardiovascular disease primary prevention programme in a primary health care setting. Results of the Polish part of the EUROACTION project,"BACKGROUND: Well designed cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention programmes appear to be generally applicable and effective in reducing exposure to risk factors and the incidence of disease. However, introducing them broadly into clinical practice would have a significant impact on the healthcare budget, and requires careful consideration. AIM: The purpose of this health economic analysis was to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of the model nurse-led, comprehensive CVD primary prevention programme which was prepared and introduced in the EUROACTION project, in high-risk patients in Poland. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the long-term costs of preventive intervention. The health states modelled were: event-free (all patients at the beginning of observation), stable angina first year, acute myocardial infarction, stable angina subsequent year, myocardial infarction subsequent year, CVD death, and other causes of death. Health benefits from the reduction in risk factors were estimated based on Framingham risk function assuming the probability of defined health states according to British registers. The time horizon of the analysis was ten years, and one Markov cycle length was one year. The analysis was prepared from the healthcare payer''s perspective. A willingness to pay threshold of three gross domestic product (GDP) per capita / quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was used. Univariate sensitivity analysis was conducted. Results were presented as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as an incremental cost per QALY. RESULTS: In Poland, EUROACTION intervention resulted mainly in reductions in the prevalence of smoking (by 14%) and high blood pressure (by 7%). Intervention on other risk factors, including blood lipids, was found to be less effective. Estimated ICERs were 19,524 PLN for men and 82,262 PLN for women. The programme was even more cost-effective in smokers i.e. estimated ICERs were 12,377 PLN in men and 53,471 PLN in women. The results were most sensitive to variations in health states utilities and cost value range as well as the duration of treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS: The model nurse-led, comprehensive CVD primary prevention programme developed in the EUROACTION project appears to be potentially highly cost-effective for high-risk male patients in Poland (below 1 GDP per capita per QALY). For women, the cost-effectiveness was less but still below the acceptable threshold (below three GDP per capita per QALY), although the sensitivity analysis showed that results were a subject of some uncertainty.",2013-01-11752,23907903,Kardiol Pol,Nevena Sovic,2013,71 / 7,702-11,No,23907903,"Nevena Sovic; Andrzej Pajak; Piotr Jankowski; Alejandra Duenas; Kalina Kawecka-Jaszcz; Renata Wolfshaut-Wolak; Urszula Stepaniak; Pawel Kawalec; Cost-effectiveness of a cardiovascular disease primary prevention programme in a primary health care setting.

A Canadian cost-utility analysis of current and future management strategies,"In Canada, Dupuytren''s contracture is managed with partial fasciectomy or percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA).

Using a cost-utility analysis approach, our aim was to identify the most cost-effective form of treatment for managing Dupuytren''s contracture it and the threshold at which collagenase is cost-effective. We developed an expected-value decision analysis model for Dupuytren''s contracture affecting a single finger, comparing the cost-effectiveness of fasciectomy, aponeurotomy and collagenase from a societal perspective. Cost-effectiveness, one-way sensitivity and variability analyses were performed using standard thresholds for cost effective treatment ($50 000 to $100 000/QALY gained). Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy was the preferred strategy for managing contractures affecting a single finger. The cost-effectiveness of primary aponeurotomy improved when repeated to treat recurrence. Fasciectomy was not cost-effective. Collagenase was cost-effective relative to and preferred over aponeurotomy at $875 and $470 per course of treatment, respectively.

METHODS: An existing Markov model was adapted to the Greek setting to reflect the natural course of the disease and the management of patients with different therapies. The model predicts health and economic outcomes and the implications for the social security system during the course of a patient''s lifetime. The data for the population of the model were derived from the international literature and local economic databases. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of dabigatran 150 mg twice daily relative to the other therapies varied from euro5547 to euro11,762 and that of dabigatran 110 mg twice daily from euro7398 to euro16,437.

11757,Economic evaluation of dabigatran etexilate in the management of atrial fibrillation in Greece,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of the present study was to evaluate, from an economic perspective, dabigatran etexilate in comparison to existing pharmaceutical therapeutic options available for the protection of moderate-to-high risk patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation from cardioembolic risk. METHODS: An existing Markov model was adapted to the Greek setting to reflect the natural course of the disease and the management of patients with different therapies. The model predicts health and economic outcomes and the implications for the social security system during the course of a patient''s lifetime. The data for the population of the model were derived from the international literature and local economic databases. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of dabigatran 150 mg twice daily relative to the other therapies varied from euro5547 to euro11,762 and that of dabigatran 110 mg twice daily from euro7398 to euro16,437.

11758,Cost-effectiveness of lung transplantation and its evolution: the Portuguese case,"OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the costs and outcomes of lung transplant in Portugal and its evolution since it was first performed in 2000. METHODS: Data were collected for all patients waiting for transplant from 31 December 2000 until 31 December 2010 (n = 61). Patients waiting for transplant were used as the comparison group. We calculated the mean restricted survival time using the Kaplan-Meier estimation method. The time horizon was closed upon the death of the last surviving patient. Costs and consequences were discounted at 5% per annum. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of transplant as compared to no transplant. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. We tested volume-outcome effects using a parametric survival regression. RESULTS: The cost of lung transplantation was 77,223euro per QALY and 121,276euro per life-year. Assuming a 50,000euro/QALY willingness-to-pay, lung transplant would be cost-effective with a 37% probability. Survival improved substantially from 5.15 years over the 2001-2010 period to 6.94 years for the 2008-2010 period. When restricting our analysis to the 2008-2010 period, the cost-effectiveness ratio decreased to euro79,016 per life-year gained and euro69,241 per QALY. Survival was significantly associated with the number of procedures performed. CONCLUSION: Although above commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds, the economic value of lung transplant holds promise in Portugal due to the large improvement in survival over the 2001-2010 period. The life-threatening character of the motivating conditions, the absence of alternative treatment, and equity concerns should be also accounted for when assessing the ""value for money"" of lung transplant.",2013-01-11761,23913127,Eur J Health Econ,Luis Mendonca,2014,15 / 7,,Yes,23913127,"Luis Mendonca; Julian Perelman; Vanessa Rodrigues; Jose Fragata; Cost-effectiveness of lung transplantation and its evolution: the Portuguese case, Eur J Health Econ, 2014 Sep; 15(7):1618-7598",QALY,Portugal,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lung transplant vs. Waiting list,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,77223,Euro,2010,121301.07
11759,Stepping down from high dose fluticasone/salmeterol to extrafine BDP/F in asthma is cost-effective,"BACKGROUND: GINA guideline recommends stepping down treatment of asthma patients where control is achieved. The aim of this analysis was to estimate the costs and health outcomes associated with step down of controlled patients on high dose fluticasone/salmeterol (FP/S 1000/100 mug daily) to either medium dose FP/S (500/100 mug) dry powder or extrafine beclometasone/formoterol (BDP/F 400/24 mug) pMDI in three European countries. METHODS: A patient-level simulation Markov model was constructed to enable the simulation of three comparative arms (FP/S 1000/100, FP/S 500/100, BDP/F 400/24). Transition probabilities and healthcare resources consumption were derived from a multinational clinical trial comparing BDP/F 400/24 mug vs. FP/S 500/100 mug as step down therapy in asthma. Direct costs and health state utilities were sourced from public source and published literature. The analysis was conducted from a health system perspective, based on six months horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) associated with high dose dry powder FP/S 1000/100 mug vs. extrafine BDP/F 400/24 mug was above 70,000 GBP and 200,000 euro/QALY (Quality Adjusted Life Years).

11761,On-pump versus off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery: cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a multisite trial,"BACKGROUND: Questions have been raised about the costs and outcomes for patients receiving on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery. As part of the Department of Veterans Affairs Randomized On/Off Bypass (ROOBY) multisite trial, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to compare on-pump versus off-pump patients'' quality-adjusted life-years and costs at 1 year. METHODS: One-year outcomes and costs (standardized to 2010 dollars) were estimated in multivariate regression models, controlling for site and baseline patient factors. The 1-year incremental cost-effectiveness analysis ratio with 95% confidence intervals was calculated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Eighteen centers randomly assigned 2,203 participants to on-pump (n=1,099) versus off-pump (n=1,104) coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Both groups'' quality of life improved significantly after surgery (p<0.01) compared with baseline, but no differences were found between treatment groups. Adjusted cost of the index coronary artery bypass graft surgery hospitalization was $36,046 on-pump and $36,536 off-pump (p=0.16). At 1 year, on-pump adjusted cost was $56,023 versus $59,623 off-pump (p=0.046). Off-pump-to-on-pump conversions after first distal anastomosis (4.8%) had significantly higher 1-year costs. Excluding conversions, there were no significant differences between treatments for index hospitalization or 1-year total costs. CONCLUSIONS: At 1 year, off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery was more expensive than on-pump when late off-pump-to-on-pump conversions were included. Excluding late conversions, there was no difference in quality-adjusted life-years or costs.

11762,A cost-effectiveness analysis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) prophylaxis in infants in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory infection that is highly prevalent in infants. Severe cases of RSV infection require hospitalisation; this is most likely to occur in infant populations at high risk. The study assesses the cost-effectiveness of palivizumab versus no prophylaxis in infants at high risk of hospitalisation with RSV in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: A decision tree model was developed to reflect the clinical pathway of infants at high risk of severe RSV infection who receive either prophylaxis with palivizumab or no prophylaxis. The main outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the degree of uncertainty surrounding the results. A threshold analysis considered the impact of clinical and environmental risk factors on the cost-effectiveness in the subgroup of preterm infants 33-35 weeks gestational age (wGA). RESULTS: Prophylaxis with palivizumab compared with no prophylaxis is associated with the following ICERs; pound33,216 for infants with congenital heart disease; pound19,168 for infants with chronic lung disease; pound3,845 for preterm infants < 29 wGA; pound30,205 for preterm infants 29-32 wGA; and pound99,056 for preterm infants 33-35 wGA. One-way sensitivity analysis suggests that these results are highly sensitive to the input data. Threshold analysis in the preterm 33-35 wGA subgroup demonstrates that an adjusted RSV-hospitalisation baseline risk of 17.94% or higher would result in an ICER below the pound30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year threshold.

11767,Cost-effectiveness of a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in Japan,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of universal vaccination with a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5) on the healthcare burden and costs associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis (RGE) in Japan. METHODS: The model included a hypothetical cohort of 1,091,156 children followed for their first 5 years of life. In the absence of universal vaccination, there were 19 deaths, 78,000 hospitalizations, and 678,000 outpatient visits due to RGE. The efficacy of RV5 is based on international clinical trial data, which was similar to the efficacy observed in clinical trials conducted in Japan. The primary outcome measure is the cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained. In the base case, the QALY loss per 1000 RGE episodes included 2.2 for children and 1.8 per parent. RESULTS: Universal vaccination is projected to reduce hospitalizations by 92%, outpatient visits by 74%, and work-loss days by 73%. For the base case analysis, the total vaccination cost was yen26 billion. The estimated reduction in medical costs was yen16 billion. Of 2500 QALYs gained with the vaccination program, approximately half are directly attributed to the child. In the base case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for vaccination vs. no vaccination is yen4 million and yen2 million per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from the healthcare payer and societal perspectives, respectively. The ICERs are yen8 million and yen4 million if parental disutilities are excluded. KEY LIMITATION: The QALY decrements for children and parents were evaluated using different instruments, and the QALY decrements do not vary based on episode severity. Given the interdependence between children and their parents, excluding parental disutilities may under-estimate the impact of RGE. CONCLUSION: Universal vaccination with RV5 in Japan is projected to have a substantial public health impact and may be cost-effective from both the payer and societal perspectives if parental disutilities are included in the cost-effectiveness ratios.",2013-01-11775,23919721,J Med Econ,Robbin Itzler,2013,16 / 10,,Yes,23919721,"Robbin Itzler; Megan A O'Brien; Kaoru Yamabe; Machiko Abe; Praveen Dhankhar; Cost-effectiveness of a pentavalent rotavirus vaccine in Japan, J Med Econ, 2013 Oct; 16(10):1369-6998",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pentavalent rotavirus vaccine (RV5) vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,2015122,Japan,2011,29120.72

METHODS: A representative sample of Chinese adults was used to create a simulated population of 20,000 people aged 25 years and above. The hybrid decision tree Markov model was developed to compare the long-term clinical and economic outcomes of four simulated diabetes prevention strategies with a control group, where no prevention applied. These preventive strategies were the following: (i) one-off screening for undiagnosed diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), with lifestyle interventions on diet, (ii) on exercise, (iii) on diet combined exercise (duo-intervention) respectively in those with IGT, and (iv) one-off screening alone. Independent age-specific models were simulated based on diverse incidences of diabetes, mortalities and health utilities. The reported outcomes were the following: the remaining survival years, the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per diabetes or IGT subjects, societal costs per simulated subject and the comparisons between preventions and control over 40 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed based on variations of all assumptions, in addition to the performance and the compliance of screening. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, all simulated screening programmes prolonged life expectancy at the initiation ages of 25 and 40 years, postponed the onset of diabetes and increased QALYs at every initiation age. Along with an assumption of six years intervention, prevention programmes were associated with cost-saving compared with the control group, especially in the population aged 25 years. The savings were at least US$2017 per subject, but no statistically significant difference was observed among the intervention strategies within each age groups. The cost savings were reduced when screening was affected by poor performance and noncompliance. CONCLUSIONS: Developing countries have few effective strategies to manage the prevention of diabetes.

These preventive strategies were the following: (i) one-off screening for undiagnosed diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), with lifestyle interventions on diet, (ii) on exercise, (iii) on diet combined exercise (duo-intervention) respectively in those with IGT, and (iv) one-off screening alone. Independent age-specific models were simulated based on diverse incidences of diabetes, mortalities and health utilities. The reported outcomes were the following: the remaining survival years, the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per diabetes or IGT subjects, societal costs per simulated subject and the comparisons between preventions and control over 40 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed based on variations of all assumptions, in addition to the performance and the compliance of screening. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, all simulated screening programmes prolonged life expectancy at the initiation ages of 25 and 40 years, postponed the onset of diabetes and increased QALYs at every initiation age. Along with an assumption of six years intervention, prevention programmes were associated with cost-saving compared with the control group, especially in the population aged 25 years. The savings were at least US$2017 per subject, but no statistically significant difference was observed among the intervention strategies within each age groups. The cost savings were reduced when screening was affected by poor performance and noncompliance. CONCLUSIONS: Developing countries have few effective strategies to manage the prevention of diabetes. One-off screening for undiagnosed diabetes and IGT, with appropriate lifestyle interventions for those with IGT are cost saving in China, especially in young adults.",2013-01-11776,23919839,BMC Public Health,Xiaoqian Liu,2013,13 /,729,No,23919839,"Xiaoqian Liu; Changping Li; Hui Gong; Zhuang Cui; Linlin Fan; Wenhua Yu; Cui Zhang; Jun Ma; An economic evaluation for prevention of diabetes mellitus in a developing country: a modelling study, BMC Public Health, ; 13():1471-2458; 729",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for undiagnosed diabetes with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) test starting at 60 years vs. None,Not Stated,64 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-1195.12,United States,2007,-1491.79
11780,Cost effectiveness of alternative strategies for incorporating bevacizumab into the primary treatment of ovarian cancer,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of strategies that incorporated bevacizumab into the primary platinum-based treatment of ovarian cancer: 1) no bevacizumab; 2) concurrent and maintenance bevacizumab for all; 3) bevacizumab for suboptimally debulked stage III and stage IV disease (high-risk cohort); and the evaluation of an alternative exploratory strategy of 4) directed bevacizumab therapy based on a predictive test for bevacizumab responsiveness. METHODS: A modified Markov state transition model with a 3-year time horizon that simulated publically available International Collaboration on Ovarian Neoplasms (ICON7) trial outcomes was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of each strategy. Costs and adverse events were incorporated. An alternative strategy was used to model the impact on overall survival of a genetic-based predictive test. A Monte Carlo simulation simultaneously accounted for uncertainty in key parameters. RESULTS: The incorporation of bevacizumab for high-risk patients had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $168,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved compared with chemotherapy alone and dominated a strategy of giving bevacizumab to all patients with ovarian cancer. Monte Carlo simulation acceptability curves indicated that, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $200,000 per QALY, the treatment of high-risk women with bevacizumab was the strategy of choice in 84% of simulations. A predictive test had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $129,000 per QALY compared with chemotherapy alone and dominated other bevacizumab treatment strategies. CONCLUSIONS: The selective treatment of women with suboptimal and/or stage IV ovarian cancer was a more cost-effective use of bevacizumab than universal treatment but still did not fall within the limits of common willingness-to-pay thresholds.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of duloxetine in chronic low back pain (CLBP) compared with other post-first-line oral medications. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Duloxetine has recently received a CLBP indication in Canada. The cost-effectiveness of duloxetine and other oral medications has not previously been evaluated for CLBP. METHODS: A Markov model was created on the basis of the economic model documented in the 2008 osteoarthritis clinical guidelines of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Treatment-specific utilities were estimated via a meta-analysis of CLBP clinical trials and a transfer-to-utility regression estimated from duloxetine CLBP trial data. Adverse event rates of comparator treatments were taken from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence model or estimated by a meta-analysis of clinical trials in osteoarthritis using a maximum-likelihood simulation technique. Costs were developed primarily from Quebec and Ontario public sources as well as the published literature and expert opinion. The 6 comparators were celecoxib, naproxen, amitriptyline, pregabalin, hydromorphone, and oxycodone. Subgroup analyses and 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base case, naproxen, celecoxib, and duloxetine were on the cost-effectiveness frontier, with naproxen the least expensive medication, celecoxib with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,881, and duloxetine with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $43,437. Other comparators were dominated. Key drivers included the rates of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events and proton pump inhibitor usage. In subgroup analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for duloxetine fell to $21,567 for a population 65 years or older and to $18,726 for a population at higher risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal adverse events. CONCLUSION: The model estimates that duloxetine is a moderately cost-effective treatment for CLBP, becoming more cost-effective for populations older than 65 years or at greater risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events.

11786,Understanding the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in children: methodological choices and seasonal variability,"BACKGROUND: The universal vaccination of children for influenza has recently been recommended in the UK and is being considered in other developed countries. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the potential costs and benefits of childhood influenza vaccination to gain a better understanding of the key drivers of cost-effectiveness. METHODS: As our case study we examined the cost-effectiveness of vaccination in Australian schoolchildren using an age-stratified Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered model. RESULTS: The results of this study highlight the critical role that methodological choices play in determining the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination. These choices include decisions about the structure of the model (including/excluding herd immunity) and what costs and benefits to include in the analysis. In scenarios where herd protection was included we estimated that the program was likely to be cost-effective. The study also illustrates the importance of the inherent seasonal variability of influenza, which can produce counter-intuitive results, with low transmission seasons being easier to control by vaccination but resulting in fewer benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Universal childhood influenza vaccination is likely to be cost-effective if a substantial herd protection effect can be achieved by the program. However, it is important that decision makers understand the role of seasonal variability and the impact of alternative methodological choices in economic evaluations of influenza vaccination.",2013-01-14091,23645539,Pharmacoeconomics,Anthony T Newall,2013,31 / 8,693-702,Yes,23645539,"Anthony T Newall; Juan Pablo Dehollain; Prudence Creighton; Philippe Beutels; James G Wood; Understanding the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination in children: methodological choices and seasonal variability, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 31(8):1179-2027; 693-702",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Government funded school based influenza vaccination (trivalent inactivated vaccine) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Existing vaccination uptake (rate: 5% for 6mo to 17 yrs & 22.8% for 18-64 yrs),Not Stated,17 Years,5 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,5.00,3577,Australia,2010,3905.9

This study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of ACE inhibitor therapy in this patient population in the Netherlands. METHODS: We compared two strategies: first, treating patients with advanced renal disease with an ACE inhibitor and no-treatment. A lifetime Markov decision model was developed simulating the progression of renal disease and using published data on costs and health outcomes. A health care perspective was adopted. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, treatment with ACE inhibitors leads to higher benefits and lower costs and dominates the no-treatment strategy.

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with HEPLISAV vs. Engerix-B((R)) to prevent hepatitis B infection in select populations. METHODS: Markov models were developed for the following populations: diabetics, patients with chronic or end stage kidney disease, healthcare workers and international travelers to countries with high HBV infection prevalence. Hepatitis B disease progression was modeled using 11 health states: seroprotected, susceptible, acute infection, chronic infection, fulminant hepatic failure, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, post-transplant care, and death. Seroprotection rates were obtained from two phase 3 clinical trials comparing HEPLISAV with Engerix-B and ranged across various populations from 89-96% for HEPLISAV and 62-81% for Engerix-B. Higher vaccination completion rates were assumed for HEPLISAV compared with Engerix-B given that fewer doses of HEPLISAV are required in a shorter period of time to achieve seroprotection for the evaluated populations. Each cycle length after the first year in the model was 1-year. All future costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. A lifetime analysis and a U.S. payer perspective were used. RESULTS: HEPLISAV has a favorable cost-effectiveness profile with incremental cost effectiveness ratios <$25,000 across all populations studied.

The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination with HEPLISAV vs. Engerix-B((R)) to prevent hepatitis B infection in select populations. METHODS: Markov models were developed for the following populations: diabetics, patients with chronic or end stage kidney disease, healthcare workers and international travelers to countries with high HBV infection prevalence. Hepatitis B disease progression was modeled using 11 health states: seroprotected, susceptible, acute infection, chronic infection, fulminant hepatic failure, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, post-transplant care, and death. Seroprotection rates were obtained from two phase 3 clinical trials comparing HEPLISAV with Engerix-B and ranged across various populations from 89-96% for HEPLISAV and 62-81% for Engerix-B. Higher vaccination completion rates were assumed for HEPLISAV compared with Engerix-B given that fewer doses of HEPLISAV are required in a shorter period of time to achieve seroprotection for the evaluated populations. Each cycle length after the first year in the model was 1-year. All future costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. A lifetime analysis and a U.S. payer perspective were used. RESULTS: HEPLISAV has a favorable cost-effectiveness profile with incremental cost effectiveness ratios <$25,000 across all populations studied. In the patients with chronic or end stage kidney disease, HEPLISAV was the dominant option and was cost-saving compared with Engerix-B.

11793,Intermittent versus indwelling urinary catheterisation in hip surgery patients: a randomised controlled trial with cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Hip surgery is associated with the risk of postoperative urinary retention. To avoid urinary retention hip surgery patients undergo urinary catheterisation. Urinary catheterisation, however, is associated with increased risk for urinary tract infection (UTI). At present, there is limited evidence for whether intermittent or indwelling urinary catheterisation is the preferred choice for short-term bladder drainage in patients undergoing hip surgery. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate differences between intermittent and indwelling urinary catheterisation in hip surgery patients in relation to nosocomial UTI and cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial with cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: The study was carried out at an orthopaedic department at a Swedish University Hospital. METHODS: One hundred and seventy hip surgery patients (patients with fractures or with osteoarthritis) were randomly allocated to either intermittent or indwelling urinary catheterisation. Data collection took place at four time points: during stay in hospital, at discharge and at 4 weeks and 4 months after discharge. RESULTS: Eighteen patients contracted nosocomial UTIs, 8 in the intermittent catheterisation group and 10 in the indwelling catheterisation group (absolute difference 2.4%, 95% CI -6.9-11.6%) The patients in the intermittent catheterisation group were more often catheterised (p<0.001) and required more bladder scans (p<0.001) but regained normal bladder function sooner than the patients in the indwelling catheterisation group (p<0.001). Fourteen percent of the patients in the intermittent group did not need any catheterisation. Cost-effectiveness was similar between the indwelling and intermittent urinary catheterisation methods. CONCLUSIONS: Both indwelling and intermittent methods could be appropriate in clinical practice. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages but by not using routine indwelling catheterisation, unnecessary catheterisations might be avoided in this patient group.",2013-01-14117,23768410,Int J Nurs Stud,Maria Halleberg Nyman,2013,50 / 12,1589-98,No,23768410,"Maria Halleberg Nyman; Margareta Gustafsson; Ann Langius-Eklof; Jan-Erik Johansson; Rolf Norlin; Lars Hagberg; Intermittent versus indwelling urinary catheterisation in hip surgery patients: a randomised controlled trial with cost-effectiveness analysis, Int J Nurs Stud, ; 50(12):1873-491X; 1589-98",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Intermittent urinary catheterisation (bladder scans with BVI 3000 performed every 4 hours until return of normal bladder function) vs. Indwelling urinary catheterisation with Foley catheter (Charriere 14), removed in the morning on post-operative day 2",osteoarthritis,Not Stated,51 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"4 Months, 4 weeks",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Euro,2011,Not Stated

11797,Early versus late initiation of rehabilitation after lumbar spinal fusion: economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial,"STUDY DESIGN: Economic evaluation conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of initiating rehabilitation 6 weeks after surgery as opposed to 12 weeks after surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: In a previously reported randomized controlled trial, we assessed the impact of timing of rehabilitation after a lumbar spinal fusion and found that a fast-track strategy led to poorer functional ability. Before making recommendations, it seems relevant to address the societal perspective including return to work, quality of life, and costs. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis and a cost-utility analysis were conducted. Eighty-two patients undergoing instrumented lumbar spinal fusion due to degenerative disc disease or spondylolisthesis (grade I or II) were randomized to an identical protocol of 4 sessions of group-based rehabilitation and were instructed in home exercises focusing on active stability training. Outcome parameters included functional disability (Oswestry Disability Index) and quality-adjusted life years. Health care and productivity costs were estimated from national registries and reported in euros. Costs and effects were transformed into net benefit. Bootstrapping was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). RESULTS: The fast-track strategy tended to be costlier by euro6869 (95% CI, -4640 to 18,378) while at the same time leading to significantly poorer outcomes of functional disability by -9 points (95% CI, -18 to -3) and a tendency for a reduced gain in quality-adjusted life years by -0.04 (95% CI, -0.13 to 0.01). The overall probability for the fast-track strategy being cost-effective does not reach 10% at conventional thresholds for cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSION: Initiating rehabilitation at 6 weeks as opposed to 12 weeks after surgery is on average more costly and less effective. The uncertainty of this result did not seem to be sensitive to methodological issues, and clinical managements who have already adapted fast-track rehabilitation strategies have reason to reconsider their choice. .",2013-01-14160,23928716,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Lisa G Oestergaard,2013,38 / 23,1979-85,No,23928716,"Lisa G Oestergaard; Finn B Christensen; Claus V Nielsen; Cody E Bunger; Soeren Fruensgaard; Rikke Sogaard; Early versus late initiation of rehabilitation after lumbar spinal fusion: economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , ; 38(23):1528-1159; 1979-85",QALY,Denmark,Not Stated,Not Stated,Initiating rehabilitation 6 weeks after lumbar spinal fusion vs. Standard/Usual Care- Initiating rehabilitation 12 weeks after lumbar spinal fusion,Not Stated,64 Years,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-98128.57,Euro,2011,-157116.2
11798,The impact of memantine in combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on admission of patients with Alzheimer's disease to nursing homes: cost-effectiveness analysis in France,"The costs associated with the care of Alzheimer''s disease patients are very high, particularly those associated with nursing home placement. The combination of a cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) and memantine has been shown to significantly delay admission to nursing homes as compared to treatment with a ChEI alone. The objective of this cost-effectiveness analysis was to evaluate the economic impact of the concomitant use of memantine and ChEI compared to ChEI alone. Markov modelling was used in order to simulate transitions over time among three discrete health states (non-institutionalised, institutionalised and deceased). Transition probabilities were obtained from observational studies and French national statistics, utilities from a previous US survey and costs from French national statistics. The analysis was conducted from societal and healthcare system perspectives. Mean time to nursing home admission was 4.57 years for ChEIs alone and 5.54 years for combination therapy, corresponding to 0.98 additional years, corresponding to a gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of 0.25. From a healthcare system perspective, overall costs were euro98,609 for ChEIs alone and euro90,268 for combination therapy, representing cost savings of euro8,341. From a societal perspective, overall costs were euro122,039 and euro118,721, respectively, representing cost savings of euro3,318. Deterministic and probabilistic (Monte Carlo simulations) sensitivity analyses indicated that combination therapy would be the dominant strategy in most scenarios. In conclusion, combination therapy with memantine and a ChEI is a cost-saving alternative compared to ChEI alone as it is associated with lower cost and increased QALYs from both a societal and a healthcare perspective.",2013-01-14161,23928827,Eur J Health Econ,Jacques Touchon,2014,15 / 8,,Yes,23928827,"Jacques Touchon; Jean Lachaine; Catherine Beauchemin; Anna Granghaud; Benoit Rive; Sebastien Bineau; The impact of memantine in combination with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors on admission of patients with Alzheimer's disease to nursing homes: cost-effectiveness analysis in France, Eur J Health Econ, 2014 Nov; 15(8):1618-7598",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) with memantine combination therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) monotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,7 Years,3.00,3.00,-13272,Euro,2010,-20847.52
11799,C-QUALITY: cost and quality-of-life pharmacoeconomic analysis of antidepressants in major depressive disorder in Italy,"INTRODUCTION: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and disabling condition across the world. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the most commonly used antidepressants. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness [euro per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)] of all SSRIs and all SNRIs for the treatment of MDD in Italy. METHODS: A decision analytic model was adapted from the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits agency model to reflect current clinical practice in the treatment of MDD in the largest Italian regions. This adaptation was possible thanks to the collaboration of an expert panel of Italian psychiatrists and health economists. The model evaluated patients with a first diagnosis of MDD and initiating an SSRI or an SNRI for the first time. The time horizon was 12 months. Efficacy and utility data for the model were retrieved from the literature and validated by the expert panel. Local data were considered for resource utilization and for treatment costs based on each regional health service perspective. Population-weighted regional data were used to define a national model. Scenario simulations, one-way sensitivity analyses, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that escitalopram was associated with a lower total cost (euro 1,562) and a larger health gain (QALYs) at 1 year (0.732) per patient and dominated the other treatment strategies since more QALYs were achieved at a lower total cost.
