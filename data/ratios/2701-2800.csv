2701,Cost-effectiveness of raloxifene in the UK: an economic evaluation based on the MORE study,"Raloxifene treatment has been shown to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures and breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The long-term economic implications of treatment with raloxifene have not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of treating postmenopausal women in the UK with raloxifene. A previously developed computer simulation model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of osteoporotic treatments with extra skeletal benefits. The model was populated with epidemiological data and cost data relevant for a UK female population. Data on the effect of treatment were taken from the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) study, which recruited women with low bone mineral density or with a prior vertebral fracture. Cost-effectiveness was estimated using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and life years gained as primary outcome measures. The cost per QALY gained of treating postmenopausal women without prior vertebral fractures was 18,000 pounds, 23,000 pounds , 18,000 pounds and 21,000 pounds at 50, 60, 70 and 80 years of age. Corresponding estimates for women with prior vertebral fractures were 10,000 pounds, 24,000 pounds, 18,000 pounds and 20,000 pounds. In relation to threshold values that are recommended in the UK, the analysis suggests that raloxifene is cost-effective in the treatment of postmenopausal women at an increased risk of vertebral fractures.",2005-01-00028,15672210,Osteoporos Int,J A Kanis,2004,16 / 1,15-25,No,15672210,"J A Kanis; F Borgström; O Johnell; A Oden; D Sykes; B Jönsson; F Borgström; O Johnell; A Oden; D Sykes; B Jönsson; Cost-effectiveness of raloxifene in the UK: an economic evaluation based on the MORE study, Osteoporos Int, 2005-Jan; 16(1):0937-941X; 15-25",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Raloxifene therapy vs. No treatment,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,6.00,1.50,18234,United Kingdom,2002,39414.47

2705,Cost-effectiveness of enhancing primary care depression management on an ongoing basis,"PURPOSE: Although potentially costly, enhancing primary care depression management on an ongoing basis results in substantial long-term treatment effectiveness. The purpose of this article is to compare the cost-effectiveness of this approach with that of usual care. METHODS: The study was conducted in 12 community primary care practices randomized to enhanced or usual care after stratification by baseline practice patterns. Practices assigned to enhanced care encouraged depressed patients to engage in active treatment, using practice nurses to provide regularly scheduled care management during the course of 24 months. We analyze outcomes for 211 adults (73.4% of potential eligible patients) beginning a new treatment episode for major depression determined by previsit screening. Outcomes included blinded estimates of days free of depression impairment as well as health care costs for 2 years. RESULTS: Enhanced care significantly increased the number of days free of depression impairment for 2 years when compared with usual care (647.6 days vs 588.2 days, P <.01). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for enhanced care ranged from 9,592 dollars to 14,306 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The number of incremental days free of depression impairment increased between the first year and the second year (23.0 vs 36.4, respectively, P <.001) while incremental health plan costs decreased significantly (568 dollars vs -12 dollars, P <.001).

2706,Elective cesarean section to prevent anal incontinence and brachial plexus injuries associated with macrosomia-a decision analysis,"Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a policy of elective C-section for macrosomic infants to prevent maternal anal incontinence, urinary incontinence, and newborn brachial plexus injuries. We used a decision analytic model to compare the standard of care with a policy whereby all primigravid patients in the United States would undergo an ultrasound at 39 weeks gestation, followed by an elective C-section for any fetus estimated at >/=4500 g. The following clinical consequences were considered crucial to the analysis: brachial plexus injury to the newborn; maternal anal and urinary incontinence; emergency hysterectomy; hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion; and maternal mortality. Our outcome measures included (1) number of brachial plexus injuries or cases of incontinence averted, (2) incremental monetary cost per 100,000 deliveries, (3) expected quality of life of the mother and her child, and (4) ""quality-adjusted life years"" (QALY) associated with the two policies. For every 100,000 deliveries, the policy of elective C-section resulted in 16.6 fewer permanent brachial plexus injuries, 185.7 fewer cases of anal incontinence, and cost savings of $3,211,000. Therefore, this policy would prevent one case of anal incontinence for every 539 elective C-sections performed. The expected quality of life associated with the elective C-section policy was also greater (quality of life score 0.923 vs 0.917 on a scale from 0.0 to 1.0 and 53.6 QALY vs 53.2). A policy whereby primigravid patients in the United States have a 39 week ultrasound-estimated fetal weight followed by C-section for any fetuses >/=4500 g appears cost effective.

2709,Cost-effectiveness of hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance in patients with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: HCV-related cirrhosis is a leading risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Surveillance might detect HCC at a treatable stage. We estimated the clinical and economic consequences of a common HCC surveillance strategy in patients with HCV-related cirrhosis in the context of alternative HCC treatment strategies. METHODS: With a Markov model, we examined surveillance with serum alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasound every 6 months in patients with compensated HCV-related cirrhosis from age 45-70 years or death, and HCC treatment with resection, cadaveric liver transplantation (CLT), or living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). RESULTS: Compared to natural history in the base case, surveillance with resection, listing for CLT, or LDLT increased life expectancy by 0.49, 2.58, and 3.81 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), respectively, all at costs less than 51,000 US dollars/QALY gained. The consequences of surveillance were most sensitive to the outcomes and costs of HCC treatments but not surveillance test performance characteristics or cost. Prioritizing CLT for patients with HCC over those with decompensated cirrhosis resulted in greater overall life expectancy with minimal increase in cost. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance for HCC in patients with compensated HCV-related cirrhosis might gain QALYs at acceptable costs. The impact of surveillance depends most on the outcomes and costs of HCC treatments, rather than surveillance test characteristics.

Prioritizing CLT for patients with HCC over those with decompensated cirrhosis resulted in greater overall life expectancy with minimal increase in cost. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance for HCC in patients with compensated HCV-related cirrhosis might gain QALYs at acceptable costs. The impact of surveillance depends most on the outcomes and costs of HCC treatments, rather than surveillance test characteristics. By increasing organ availability for timely definitive treatment, LDLT might achieve the greatest gain in life expectancy at acceptable costs.

2714,Cost effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa (activated) for the treatment of severe sepsis in the United Kingdom,"Drotrecogin alfa (activated) is licensed in Europe for the treatment of severe sepsis in patients with multiple organ failure. We constructed a model to assess the cost effectiveness of drotrecogin alfa (activated) from the perspective of the UK National Health Service when used in adult intensive care units. Patient outcomes from a 28-day international clinical trial (PROWESS) and a subsequent follow-up study (EVBI) were supplemented with UK data. Cost effectiveness was assessed as incremental cost per life year and per quality adjusted life year saved compared to placebo alongside best usual care. Applying the 28-day mortality outcomes of the PROWESS study, the model produced a cost per life year saved of 4608 UK pounds and cost per quality adjusted life year saved of 6679 UK pounds. Equivalent results using actual hospital outcomes were 7625 UK pounds per life year and 11,051 UK pounds per quality adjusted life year.

2715,Vaccination versus treatment of influenza in working adults: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination, antiviral therapy, or no intervention for healthy working adults, accounting for annual variation in vaccine efficacy. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis based on published clinical trials of influenza vaccine and antiviral drugs, incorporating 10 years of surveillance data from the World Health Organization. We modeled influenza vaccination, treatment of influenza-like illness with antiviral drugs, or both, as compared with no intervention, targeting healthy working adults under age 50 years in the general community or workplace. Outcomes included costs, illness days, and quality-adjusted days gained. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the majority of costs incurred for all strategies were related to lost productivity from influenza illness. The least expensive strategy varied from year to year. For the 10-year period, antiviral therapy without vaccination was associated with the lowest overall costs (234 US dollars per person per year). Annual vaccination cost was 239 US dollars per person, and was associated with 0.0409 quality-adjusted days saved, for a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of 113 US dollars per quality-adjusted day gained or 41,000 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year saved compared with antiviral therapy. No intervention was the most expensive and least effective option. In sensitivity analyses, lower vaccination costs, higher annual probabilities of influenza, and higher numbers of workdays lost to influenza made vaccination more cost-effective than treatment. If vaccination cost was less than 16 US dollars or time lost from work exceeded 2.4 days per episode of influenza, then vaccination was cost saving compared with all other strategies.

2720,Cost-effectiveness of training unselected laypersons in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation,"PURPOSE: The cost-effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation training for laypersons unselected for risk of encountering cases of cardiac arrest is not known. We compared the costs and health benefits of alternative resuscitation training strategies for adults without professional first-responder duties who are at average risk of encountering cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. METHODS: We constructed a cost-effectiveness analytic model. Data on cardiac arrest epidemiology and the effectiveness of CPR/defibrillation training were obtained from the medical literature. Instructional costs were determined from a survey of training programs. Downstream cardiac arrest survivor quality-adjusted life expectancy and long-term health care costs were derived from prior studies. We compared three strategies for training unselected laypersons: CPR/defibrillation training alone, training combined with home defibrillator purchase, and no training. The main outcome measures were total instructional costs for trainees combined with health care costs for additional cardiac arrest survivors, and quality-adjusted survival for additional patients resuscitated by trainees. RESULTS: CPR/defibrillation training yielded 2.7 quality-adjusted hours of life at a cost of 62 US dollars per trainee (202,400 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained). Training laypersons in CPR/defibrillation with subsequent defibrillator purchase cost 2,489,700 US dollars per QALY. In contrast, CPR/defibrillation training cost less than 75,000 US dollars per QALY if trainees lived with persons older than 75 years or with persons who had cardiac disease, or if total training costs were less than 10 US dollars.

2722,Cost-effectiveness of proton radiation in the treatment of childhood medulloblastoma,"BACKGROUND: Radiation therapy is an important component in the treatment of medulloblastoma; however, in many patients, it is associated with risk of late adverse events. Proton radiation therapy has potential to reduce the risk of adverse events compared with conventional radiation, but it is associated with a higher treatment cost. The objective of the current study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of proton therapy compared with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of childhood medulloblastoma. METHODS: The consequences of radiation therapy were evaluated using a Markov simulation model. Children age 5 years with medulloblastoma were followed. The patients were at risk of several types of adverse events, including hearing loss, intelligence quotient (IQ) loss, hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency (GHD), osteoporosis, cardiac disease, and secondary malignancies. The patients also were at risk of death and were divided into risk groups for normal death, death due to tumor recurrence, treatment-related cardiac death, treatment-related subsequent tumor death, or treatment-related other death. A review of the literature was conducted to estimate the parameters in the model. RESULTS: The base-case results showed that proton therapy was associated with 23,600 in cost savings and 0.68 additional quality-adjusted life-years per patient. The analyses showed that reductions in IQ loss and GHD contributed to the greatest part of the cost savings and were the most important parameters for cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicated that proton radiation therapy can be cost-effective and cost-saving compared with conventional radiation therapy in the treatment of children with medulloblastoma if the appropriate patients are selected for the therapy. However, there have been few long-term follow-up studies, and more much information on the long-term consequences of radiation therapy is needed. Cancer 2005.

2723,The cost effectiveness of health insurance,"BACKGROUND: Although studies have examined both the adverse consequences of lacking health insurance and the costs of insuring the uninsured, there are no estimates of the value of providing health insurance to those currently uninsured. OBJECTIVE: To examine the value associated with providing insurance to those currently uninsured through an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: People aged 25 to 64 in both the National Health Interview Survey (with 2-year mortality follow-up) and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey were examined to estimate the contribution of sociodemographic, health, and health behavior characteristics on insured persons"" quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and healthcare costs. Parameter estimates from these regression models were used to predict QALYs and costs associated with insuring the uninsured, given their characteristics for 1996. Markov decision-analysis modeling was then employed to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of insurance for the average 25-year-old adult (through age 64) is approximately $35,000 per QALY gained (range $21,000 to $48,000). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio becomes more favorable as people approach age 65.

2724,Specialist nurse-led clinics to improve control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in diabetes: economic analysis of the SPLINT trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of specialist nurse-led clinics provided to improve lipid and blood pressure control in diabetic patients receiving hospital-based care. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A policy of targeting improved care through specialist nurse-led clinics is evaluated using a novel method, linking the cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatments with the cost and level of behavioral change achieved by the specialist nurse-led clinics. Treatment cost-effectiveness is modeled from the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study and Heart Protection Study treatment trials, whereas specialist nurse-led clinics are evaluated using the Specialist Nurse-Led Clinics to Improve Control of Hypertension and Hyperlipidemia in Diabetes (SPLINT) trial. RESULTS: Good lipid and blood pressure control are cost-effective treatment goals for patients with diabetes. Modeling findings from treatment trials, blood pressure lowering is estimated to be cost saving and life prolonging (-1,400 dollars/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]), whereas lipid-lowering is estimated to be highly cost-effective (8,230 dollars/QALY). Investing in nurse-led clinics to help achieve these benefits imposes an addition on treatment cost-effectiveness leading to higher estimates: 4,020 dollars/QALY and 19,950 dollars/QALY, respectively. For both clinics combined, the estimated cost-effectiveness is 9,070 dollars/QALY. Using an acceptability threshold of 50,000 dollars/QALY, the likelihood that blood pressure-lowering clinics are cost-effective is 77%, lipid clinics 99%, and combined clinics 83%. CONCLUSIONS: A method is described for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of policies to change patient uptake of health care. Such policies are less attractive than treatment cost-effectiveness (which implies cost-less self-implementation). However, specialist nurse-led clinics, as an adjunct to hospital-based diabetic care, combining both lipid and blood pressure control, appear effective and likely to provide excellent value for money.",2005-01-00055,15616231,Diabetes Care,James M Mason,2005,28 / 1,40-6,No,15616231,"James M Mason; Nick Freemantle; J Martin Gibson; John P New; Nick Freemantle; J Martin Gibson; John P New; Specialist nurse-led clinics to improve control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia in diabetes: economic analysis of the SPLINT trial, Diabetes Care, 2005-Jan; 28(1):0149-5992; 40-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Usual care with invitaion to specialist nurse-led clinics vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,Not Stated,United States,2003,Not Stated
2725,Is adjuvant therapy for older patients with node (-) early breast cancer cost-effective?,"BACKGROUND: Node (-) breast cancer represents over 60% of cases in older women and currently there is a debate whether adjuvant therapy for these women is cost-effective. PURPOSE: Evaluate if adjuvant treatment for early-stage node (-) breast cancer with hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or combination therapy is cost-effective in older patients. DESIGN: Decision-analysis modeling using life tables integrated the cost of treatment in dollars and impact in length and quality of life.

In a 75-year-old ER (-) the use of chemotherapy (AC or CMF) or 85-year-old ER (+) the use of hormone therapy was only marginally cost-effective, 54,000-76,000 dollars/QALY, only if efficacy was assumed to be age-insensitive (similar to a 65-year-old woman).

2727,Analysis of aspirin-associated risks in healthy individuals,"BACKGROUND: Aspirin therapy is widely accepted for patients with documented cardiovascular disease, but there is a growing trend among healthy individuals to use aspirin as primary prevention for both cardiovascular disease and cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of the complications of aspirin therapy on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in healthy individuals. METHODS: A computer-based decision-analytic model was constructed. In this model, healthy individuals taking aspirin were assumed to receive no advantages from the aspirin, but were at risk of developing its associated complications. Individuals took 325 mg of enteric-coated aspirin every day until death, discontinuing therapy only if an aspirin-induced complication occurred. The analysis was performed from a societal perspective, starting at age 50 years. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the absence of any beneficial effect, aspirin reduced QALYs by 0.03 per individual. Unadjusted life expectancy was decreased by 0.04 years (2 wk). Lifetime aspirin use cost an average of $460/healthy person. The total complication rate over a lifetime of aspirin therapy was 6.79%, with a mortality rate of 0.18%. Alternatively stated, there was one complication for every 15 individuals treated and one death for every 556 individuals treated. Extensive sensitivity analysis showed the range of results possible when varying age, gender, length of follow-up, and other key parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming no benefits, aspirin therapy in healthy individuals leads to a small reduction in QALYs at an overall low cost per person. However, approximately 1 in 15 individuals will experience an aspirin-induced complication and 1 in 556 individuals will die.",2005-01-00080,15590881,Ann Pharmacother,Chin Hur,2005,39 / 1,51-7,No,15590881,"Chin Hur; Lee S Simon; G Scott Gazelle; Lee S Simon; G Scott Gazelle; Analysis of aspirin-associated risks in healthy individuals, Ann Pharmacother, 2005-Jan; 39(1):1060-0280; 51-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Enteric-coated aspirin vs. No aspirin,Not Stated,Not Stated,51 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-15333.33,United States,2000,-23045.5
2728,Occupational therapy compared with social work assessment for older people. An economic evaluation alongside the CAMELOT randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: To compare costs and outcome of occupational therapy-led assessment with social worker-led assessment of older people, in terms of their independence and quality of life. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial. The analysis took viewpoints of health services and patients. The primary outcome measure for cost-effectiveness was dependency using the Community Dependency Index (CDI). Secondary outcomes included utility scores based on the EuroQoL (EQ-5D). Resource use was measured for each patient, from clinical records and from patient carer interviews at 8 months. Unit costs of health and social care resources were derived from local sources and national datasets. Cost-effectiveness was analysed using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: There were no differences between the two arms of the trial in terms of cost-effectiveness. There is an apparent increase in mean cost per case for the occupational therapy arm but this is not statistically significant (mean difference in cost per case 542 pounds, 95% CI 434-1,519 pounds). Mean total costs of care per participant were 4,379 pounds and 3,837 pounds for the occupational therapy and social work arms, respectively. At best the intervention would improve outcomes at a cost of 14,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The probability of such an outcome was <50%. CONCLUSIONS: From a policy perspective, the lack of difference in clinical and cost-effectiveness means that either a social work or an occupational therapy service is successful in making care assessments that enable an older person to remain in their own home.",2005-01-00107,15537680,Age Ageing,Chris Flood,2005,34 / 1,47-52,No,15537680,"Chris Flood; Miranda Mugford; Sandra Stewart; Ian Harvey; Fiona Poland; Walter Lloyd-Smith; Miranda Mugford; Sandra Stewart; Ian Harvey; Fiona Poland; Walter Lloyd-Smith; Occupational therapy compared with social work assessment for older people.

2733,Cost-effectiveness of screening for deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound at admission to stroke rehabilitation,"Wilson RD, Murray PK. Cost-effectiveness of screening for deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound at admission to stroke rehabilitation. OBJECTIVE: This project was a cost-effectiveness analysis of the practice of routine Doppler ultrasound screening for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in patients with ischemic stroke at the time of admission to rehabilitation. DESIGN: A decision-analysis model was created to compare 2 approaches for detecting DVT in a stroke population: (1) screening all patients with acute ischemic stroke at admission to stroke rehabilitation for DVT by Doppler ultrasound with subsequent treatment; or (2) clinical surveillance for signs of DVT and treatment after confirmation by Doppler ultrasound. The prevalence of DVT, risk of complication from DVT, and risk of complication from treatment were obtained from published reports. Costs are in 2004 dollars and the effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. We conducted these analyses from a societal perspective. SETTING: Inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit. PARTICIPANTS: Not applicable. INTERVENTION: Screening all patients with acute ischemic stroke at admission to stroke rehabilitation for DVT by Doppler ultrasound with subsequent treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost in 2004 dollars per QALY gained by screening all patients with acute ischemic stroke at admission to stroke rehabilitation for DVT by Doppler ultrasound with subsequent treatment. RESULTS: The expected utility of screening patients with ischemic stroke for DVT by Doppler ultrasound on admission to rehabilitation is 1.875 QALYs and that of not screening is 1.872 QALYs. The expected gain is .0026 QALYs (23h). Obtaining this increase in quality-adjusted life incurs additional cost of $168 per stroke patient and a marginal cost-effectiveness of $67,200 for each QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: This study estimates that the cost-effectiveness ratio is considerably higher than that reported in other rehabilitation conditions and higher than the commonly stated level for an intervention to be considered cost-effective. The difference from previous reports primarily relates to the shorter life expectancy following stroke, the prevalence of occult DVT at admission, rate of complications of anticoagulation, and the estimates of the screening's test characteristics used in our study. Further study of these areas is likely to contribute to improving our understanding of the most appropriate care of these patients.",2005-01-01181,16213235,Arch Phys Med Rehabil,Richard D Wilson,2005,86 / 10,1941-8,No,16213235,"Richard D Wilson; Patrick K Murray; Cost-effectiveness of screening for deep vein thrombosis by ultrasound at admission to stroke rehabilitation, Arch Phys Med Rehabil, 2005-Oct; 86(10):0003-9993; 1941-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by Doppler ultrasound followed by treatment vs. Clinical surveillance for DVT and treatment after Doppler ultrasound,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,4 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,67222,United States,2004,92100.55
2735,Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators,"BACKGROUND: Eight randomized trials have evaluated whether the prophylactic use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) improves survival among patients who are at risk for sudden death due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction but who have not had a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the ICD in the populations represented in these primary-prevention trials. METHODS: We developed a Markov model of the cost, quality of life, survival, and incremental cost-effectiveness of the prophylactic implantation of an ICD, as compared with control therapy, among patients with survival and mortality rates similar to those in each of the clinical trials. We modeled the efficacy of the ICD as a reduction in the relative risk of death on the basis of the hazard ratios reported in the individual clinical trials. RESULTS: Use of the ICD increased lifetime costs in every trial. Two trials--the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Patch Trial and the Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT)--found that the prophylactic implantation of an ICD did not reduce the risk of death and thus was both more expensive and less effective than control therapy. For the other six trials--the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT) I, MADIT II, the Multicenter Unsustained Tachycardia Trial (MUSTT), the Defibrillators in Non-Ischemic Cardiomyopathy Treatment Evaluation (DEFINITE) trial, the Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing, and Defibrillation in Heart Failure (COMPANION) trial, and the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT)--the use of an ICD was projected to add between 1.01 and 2.99 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and between 68,300 dollars and 101,500 dollars in cost. Using base-case assumptions, we found that the cost-effectiveness of the ICD as compared with control therapy in these six populations ranged from 34,000 dollars to 70,200 dollars per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that this cost-effectiveness ratio would remain below 100,000 dollars per QALY as long as the ICD reduced mortality for seven or more years.

2740,Cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators,"BACKGROUND: Eight randomized trials have evaluated whether the prophylactic use of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) improves survival among patients who are at risk for sudden death due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction but who have not had a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the ICD in the populations represented in these primary-prevention trials. METHODS: We developed a Markov model of the cost, quality of life, survival, and incremental cost-effectiveness of the prophylactic implantation of an ICD, as compared with control therapy, among patients with survival and mortality rates similar to those in each of the clinical trials. We modeled the efficacy of the ICD as a reduction in the relative risk of death on the basis of the hazard ratios reported in the individual clinical trials. RESULTS: Use of the ICD increased lifetime costs in every trial. Two trials--the Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Patch Trial and the Defibrillator in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (DINAMIT)--found that the prophylactic implantation of an ICD did not reduce the risk of death and thus was both more expensive and less effective than control therapy.

2743,Should resistance testing be performed for treatment-naive HIV-infected patients? A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Data from the United States and Europe show a population prevalence of baseline drug resistance of 8%-10% among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who are antiretroviral naive. Our objective was to determine the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of genotype resistance testing for treatment-naive patients with chronic HIV infection. METHODS: We utilized a state-transition model of HIV disease to project life expectancy, costs, and cost-effectiveness in a hypothetical cohort of antiretroviral-naive patients with chronic HIV infection. On the basis of a US survey of treatment-naive patients from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we used a baseline prevalence of drug resistance of 8.3%. RESULTS: A strategy of genotype-resistance testing at initial diagnosis of HIV infection increased per-person quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.0 months, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 23,900 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained, compared with no genotype testing. The cost-effectiveness ratio for resistance testing remained less than 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained, unless the prevalence of resistance was < or =1%, a level lower than those reported in most regions of the United States and Europe. In sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness remained favorable through wide variations in baseline assumptions, including variations in genotype cost, prevalence of resistance overall and to individual drug classes, and sensitivity of resistance testing. CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-resistance testing of chronically HIV-infected, antiretroviral-naive patients is likely to improve clinical outcomes and is cost-effective, compared with other HIV care in the United States.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of nucleic acid amplification testing for West Nile virus in the U.S. blood supply. DESIGN: Markov cohort simulation. DATA SOURCES: Outcome probabilities estimated from nucleic acid testing done for West Nile virus in 2003, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and published literature. Costs were taken from an economic study of West Nile virus infection and from estimated test costs. TARGET POPULATIONS: Transfusion recipients, 60 years of age or older, with and without underlying immunocompromise. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: The authors compared 6 strategies, taking into consideration minipool (pools of 6 to 16 donations) versus individual donation testing, and the geographic and seasonal nature of West Nile virus activity. OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs and effects of each strategy based on the prevention of transfusion-transmitted West Nile virus. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The cost-effectiveness of annual, national minipool testing was 483,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), whereas the cost-effectiveness of annual, national individual donation testing was 897,000 dollars/QALY. The cost-effectiveness of targeted individual donation testing in an area experiencing an outbreak coupled with minipool testing elsewhere was 520,000 dollars/QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In 1-way analyses, the most important influences were the prevalence of West Nile virus and the cost of minipool testing and individual donation testing. The 95% range of results from probabilistic sensitivity analysis for targeted individual donation testing was 256,000 dollars to 1,044,000 dollars/QALY. LIMITATIONS: The outcomes of West Nile virus infection were based on data from the general population rather than from the population who received transfusions.

Methods and Results: Currently, stenotic coronary plaques are treated without regard to vulnerability. In a new strategy, vulnerable coronary plaques are detected with a catheter-based test and treated with a drug-eluting stent, regardless of degree of stenosis. A Markov-decision model was developed to compare the new strategy with current practice. Monte Carlo simulations were performed from a societal perspective, costs were converted to year 2003 U.S. dollars, and future costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of assumptions on variables such as the prevalence of vulnerable plaques and treatment effect. In 60-year-old male patients with coronary stenoses the new strategy would be less expensive and more effective than current practice ($37,045 vs $38,257 and 10.23 vs 9.86 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), respectively). The benefits of the new strategy were robust in sensitivity analyses (e.g., if the prevalence of vulnerable plaques in this patient group was 50% or more and the sensitivity and specificity of the new test were at least 0.80). Conclusion: In selected patients with coronary artery stenosis, the detection of vulnerable plaques with a catheter-based test followed by their treatment with a drug-eluting stent could be a less expensive and more effective strategy than current practice. If applied to 1 million such patients in the United States undergoing catheterization, the new strategy would add 370,000 QALYs and save $1.2 billion dollars per year.

2751,Cost-effectiveness of oral ibandronate versus IV zoledronic acid or IV pamidronate for bone metastases in patients receiving oral hormonal therapy for breast cancer in the United Kingdom,"Abstract BACKGROUND:: Oral ibandronate is a single-nitrogen bisphosphonate whose efficacy is similar to that of IV ibandronate for the treatment of bone metastases. OBJECTIVE:: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of oral ibandronate with zoledronic acid and generic pamidronate (both administered by IV) for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with breast cancer receiving oral hormonal therapy in the United Kingdom. METHODS:: A global economic model was adapted to the UK National Health Service. Patients were assumed to receive oral hormonal therapy for 50% of their projected 14.3-month survival. The primary outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Bisphosphonate efficacy data for relative risk reduction of skeletal-related events (SREs) were obtained from clinical trials. Resource use data and costs associated with IV bisphosphonate infusions were derived from published studies and a unit cost database; monthly drug acquisition costs were obtained from the British National Formulary. Utility scores were applied to time with or without an SRE to adjust survival for quality of life. Therefore, differences in QALYs were driven by utility weights rather than survival time. Model design and inputs were validated through expert UK clinician review. The absence of comparative efficacy and safety data from clinical trials for the different bisphosphonates was a model limitation that we addressed by supporting our assumptions with UK expert clinician opinion and with expert clinician opinion outside of the United Kingdom, and by conducting sensitivity analyses. RESULTS:: The projected total cost per patient was pound307 less with oral ibandronate compared with zoledronic acid, and pound158 less compared with the use of generic pamidronate (due to a reduction in staff time for infusions, avoidance of renal safety monitoring visits, and, in the case of IV generic pamidronate, a reduction in the number of SREs). Oral ibandronate was estimated to lead to a gain of 0.02 QALY, making it the economically dominant treatment option. CONCLUSIONS:: In this study, we found that oral ibandronate was cost-effective for the management of bone metastases from breast cancer among patients receiving oral hormonal therapy in the United Kingdom. Oral ibandronate provided effective SRE and bone-pain management while avoiding resource use and costs associated with regular IV bisphosphonate infusions.

2753,Trial-based cost-utility comparison of percutaneous myocardial laser revascularisation and continued medical therapy for treatment of refractory angina pectoris,"This study examined from a health service perspective whether percutaneous myocardial laser revascularisation (PMR) plus standard medical management is cost-effective when compared with standard medical management alone in the treatment of refractory angina. This involved a cost-utility analysis using patient-specific data from a single-centre, randomised, controlled trial carried out in the United Kingdom. Of 73 patients diagnosed as having refractory angina and not suitable for conventional forms of revascularisation, 36 were randomised to PMR plus medical management and 37 to medical management alone. We collected costs to the health service of PMR and all secondary sector health care contacts and cardiac-related medication in the 12 months following randomisation. Patient utility, measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire, was combined with 12-month survival data to generate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The mean 12-month cost per patient for PMR was pound8,307, and that for medical management was pound1,888, giving a cost difference of pound6,410. The mean QALY difference favoured PMR at 0.126, giving an incremental cost per QALY of pound50,873. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicates that the probability of PMR being cost-effective over the first 12 months is quite low. Whilst a longer period of follow-up might indicate continued benefit from PMR, which would make the intervention economically more attractive, PMR could not be considered cost-effective based on 1-year follow-up data.",2005-01-01193,16195897,Eur J Health Econ,Helen Campbell,2005,/,,Yes,16195897,"Helen Campbell; Sue Tait; Linda Sharples; Noreen Caine; Timothy Gray; Peter Schofield; Martin Buxton; Trial-based cost-utility comparison of percutaneous myocardial laser revascularisation and continued medical therapy for treatment of refractory angina pectoris, Eur J Health Econ, 2005-Sep-30; ():1618-7598",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Percutaneous myocardial laser revascularisation plus medical management vs. Standard medical management alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,50873,United Kingdom,2000,115881.2
2754,Economic evaluation of Avonex (interferon beta-Ia) in patients following a single demyelinating event,"BACKGROUND: Interferon beta-Ia (Avonex) 30 microg, intramuscular (i.m.), once weekly is efficacious in delaying clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) following a single demyelinating event (SDE). This study determined the cost effectiveness of Avonex compared to current treatment in delaying the onset of CDMS. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) were performed from Ministry of Health (MoH) and societal perspectives. For CEA, the outcome of interest was time spent in the pre-CDMS state, termed monosymptomatic life years (MLY) gained. For CUA, the outcome was quality-adjusted monosymptomatic life years (QAMLY) gained. A Markov model was developed with transitional probabilities and utilities derived from the literature. Costs were reported in 2002 Canadian dollars. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 5%. The time horizon was 12 years for the CEA, and 15 years for the CUA. All uncertainties were tested via univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the CEA, the incremental cost of Avonex per ILYgained was $53110 and $44789 from MoH and societal perspectives, respectively. In the CUA, the incremental cost of Avonex per QAMLY gained was $227586 and $189286 from MoH and societal perspectives, respectively. Both models were sensitive to the probability of progressing to CDMS and the analytical time horizon. The CUA was sensitive to the utilities value. CONCLUSION: Avonex may be considered as a reasonably cost-effective approach to treatment of patients experiencing an SDE In addition, the overall incremental cost-effectiveness profile of Avonex improves if treatment is initiated in pre-CDMS rather than waiting until CDMS.",2005-01-01194,16193892,Mult Scler,Michael Iskedjian,2005,11 / 5,542-51,No,16193892,"Michael Iskedjian; John H Walker; Trevor Gray; Colin Vicente; Thomas R Einarson; Adel Gehshan; Economic evaluation of Avonex (interferon beta-Ia) in patients following a single demyelinating event, Mult Scler, 2005-Oct; 11(5):1352-4585; 542-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Avonex therapy vs. Current treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,5.00,5.00,189286,Canada,2001,178663.17
2755,The cost-effectiveness of expanded testing for primary HIV infection,"PURPOSE: Primary infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a major factor in the HIV epidemic. Most patients become symptomatic and seek care, but seldom are they tested or is their condition diagnosed. The objectives of this study are to determine whether it is cost-effective to expand testing for primary HIV infection to a larger cohort of patients, and, if so, which diagnostic assay is most cost-effective. METHODS: We undertook a cost-effectiveness analysis of testing a hypothetical cohort of more than 3 million outpatients with fever and other viral symptoms regardless of HIV risk factors using 3 diagnostic assays: p24 antigen enzyme immunosorbent assay (EIA), HIV-1 RNA assay, and third-generation HIV-1 EIA. Antiretroviral therapy was started when the CD4 cell count decreased to 350/microL. Outcome measures were the incremental cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic assays, number of cases identified, cases avoided in sexual partners, and threshold prevalence. For sensitivity analyses, we used 50,000 dollars as the threshold for cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: At the baseline prevalence of 0.66%, p24 antigen EIA testing was the most cost-effective option at a cost of 30,800 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained when compared with no testing. There were 17,054 cases identified, and infection was avoided in 435 partners. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis, in which the estimates for all variables are varied simultaneously, determined that expanded testing with p24 antigen EIA compared with no testing had a 67% probability of being cost-effective at the baseline prevalence and a 71% probability at a prevalence of 1%.

2758,"Expanding screening for rare metabolic disease in the newborn: an analysis of costs, effect and ethical consequences for decision-making in Finland","AIM: Currently, the only metabolic disorder that newborns are screened for in Finland is congenital hypothyroidism. A proposal to start a pilot study on screening for other rare metabolic diseases using tandem mass spectrometry prompted a health technology assessment project on the effect and costs of expanded newborn screening programme options. METHOD: A modelling study using data from current published studies, healthcare registers and expert opinion. RESULTS: The annual running cost of screening 56,000 newborns for the chosen five disorders (congenital adrenal hyperplasia, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency [MCADD], long chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency [LCHADD], phenylketonuria [PKU] and glutaric aciduria type 1 [GA 1]) was estimated to be euros 2.5 million or euros 45 per newborn when starting costs were included. The costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained are a maximum of euros 25,500. Prevention of severe handicap in one newborn would reduce the costs to a maximum of euros 18,000 per QALY gained.

2759,Screening for congenital cataracts: a cost-consequence analysis of eye examination at maternity wards in comparison to well-baby clinics,"AIM: To estimate, on a national basis in Sweden, the costs versus consequences of combined maternity ward and well-baby clinic eye screening compared to well-baby clinic screening alone. METHODS: Two scenarios were created and compared regarding healthcare costs: visual acuity development and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). One scenario represented early management (combined maternity ward and well-baby clinic screening); the other represented less early management (well-baby clinic screening only). Each scenario was based on 100,000 births, and the healthcare costs were calculated from detection until age 18 y. All estimates of prevalence, visual outcome, postoperative complications and screening procedures were based on previous, recently published studies. Estimated costs were obtained from St. Erik's Eye Hospital in Stockholm and the University Hospital of Lund, at 2001 prices. RESULTS: Total cost of the maternity ward/well-baby clinic screening scenario was 7.9 million SEK, and that of the maternity ward screening scenario was 6.9 million SEK. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated at 234,000 SEK/QALY provided three more children per year were detected in Sweden by mandatory maternity ward/well-baby clinic screening. CONCLUSION: The incremental expense of introducing combined maternity ward/well-baby clinic eye screening on a nationwide basis is cost effective and within acceptable levels of cost/QALY when compared with other widely accepted therapies across diverse medical specialties.",2005-01-01199,16188854,Acta Paediatr,Gunilla Magnusson,2005,94 / 8,1089-95,No,16188854,"Gunilla Magnusson; Ulf Persson; Screening for congenital cataracts: a cost-consequence analysis of eye examination at maternity wards in comparison to well-baby clinics, Acta Paediatr, 2005-Aug; 94(8):0803-5253; 1089-95",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for cataracts in the maternity ward and well-baby clinics vs. Screening in well-baby clinics alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,18 Years,3.00,3.00,234000,Sweden,2001,33117.38
2760,The cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination of healthy adults 50-64 years of age,"Influenza can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Influenza vaccination is an effective and safe strategy in the prevention of influenza. Currently the National Health Service (NHS) vaccinates 'at-risk' individuals only. This definition includes everyone over 65 years of age but excludes individuals 50-64 years of age unless they have an additional risk factor, such as underlying heart disease or lung disease. In order to examine the cost-effectiveness of an extension of the vaccination policy to include this age group we constructed an economic model to estimate the costs and benefits of vaccination from both a health service and a societal perspective. Data to populate the model was obtained from the literature and the outcome measure used was the quality adjusted life year (QALY). Influenza vaccination prevented an estimated 4508 cases (95% CI: 2431-7606) per 100,000 vaccinees per influenza season for a net cost to the NHS of pound653,221 (95% CI: 354,575-1,072,257). The net cost increased to pound1,139,069 (95% CI 27,052-2,030,473) when non-NHS costs were included and the estimated cost-per-QALY were pound6174 and pound10,766 for NHS and all costs respectively.

2761,Cost effectiveness of chest computed tomography after lung cancer resection: a decision analysis model,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative surveillance with chest computed tomography (CT) is often performed in patients who have undergone resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), despite lack of supporting data. This study involves the creation of a decision analysis model to predict the cost effectiveness of postoperative surveillance CT. METHODS: A decision analysis model was created in which a hypothetical cohort of patients underwent annual chest CT after resection of a stage IA NSCLC. The incidence of second primary lung cancer (SPLC), sensitivity and specificity of CT, as well as survival after resection of initial primary and SPLC were derived from published literature. The cost of CT and other procedures prompted by a positive finding on CT was calculated from Medicare reimbursement schedules. Cost effectiveness was defined as a cost of less than 60,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained in the cohort under surveillance compared with controls under no surveillance. RESULTS: In the initial (base case) analysis, the cost of surveillance CT was 47,676 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained, implying cost effectiveness. However, factors that rendered surveillance CT cost ineffective were (1) age at entry into the surveillance program greater than 65 years, (2) cost of CT greater than 700 dollars, (3) incidence of SPLC of less than 1.6% per patient per year of follow-up, and (4) a false positive rate of surveillance CT greater than 14%.

2763,Cost effectiveness of chest computed tomography after lung cancer resection: a decision analysis model,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative surveillance with chest computed tomography (CT) is often performed in patients who have undergone resection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), despite lack of supporting data. This study involves the creation of a decision analysis model to predict the cost effectiveness of postoperative surveillance CT. METHODS: A decision analysis model was created in which a hypothetical cohort of patients underwent annual chest CT after resection of a stage IA NSCLC. The incidence of second primary lung cancer (SPLC), sensitivity and specificity of CT, as well as survival after resection of initial primary and SPLC were derived from published literature. The cost of CT and other procedures prompted by a positive finding on CT was calculated from Medicare reimbursement schedules. Cost effectiveness was defined as a cost of less than 60,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained in the cohort under surveillance compared with controls under no surveillance. RESULTS: In the initial (base case) analysis, the cost of surveillance CT was 47,676 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained, implying cost effectiveness. However, factors that rendered surveillance CT cost ineffective were (1) age at entry into the surveillance program greater than 65 years, (2) cost of CT greater than 700 dollars, (3) incidence of SPLC of less than 1.6% per patient per year of follow-up, and (4) a false positive rate of surveillance CT greater than 14%.

Design: A Markov model with a lifetime time horizon and eight health states (no fracture, distal forearm fracture, radiographic (but clinically inapparent) vertebral fracture, clinical vertebral fracture, hip fracture, hip and vertebral fracture, and other fractures), using the societal perspective. Setting: Women living independently and those in nursing homes. Participants: Caucasian women aged 65, 75, 85, or 95. Intervention: Bone densitometry of the hip, with 5 years of alendronate therapy for those found to have osteoporosis versus no intervention (densitometry or drug therapy). Measurements: Lifetime accumulated quality adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Results: The cost per QALY gained for the screen-and-treat strategy was $43,000 per QALY gained for 65-year-old women and $5,600 per QALY gained for 75-year-old women. For 85- and 95-year-old women, the screen-and-treat strategy was cost saving. Sensitivity analyses showed that the screen-and-treat strategy was cost-effective even under assumptions of reduced adherence to drug therapy, reduced fracture reduction benefit from alendronate therapy, or reduced QALYs saved by preventing fracture.

2768,Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies prior to carotid endarterectomy,"The main objective of this study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of five alternative diagnostic strategies for identification of severe carotid stenosis in recently symptomatic patients. A decision-analytical model with Markov transition states was constructed. Data sources included a prospective study involving 167 patients who had screening Doppler ultrasound (DUS), confirmatory contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CEMRA) and confirmatory digital subtraction angiography (DSA), individual patient data from the European Carotid Surgery Trial and other published clinical and cost data. A ""selective"" strategy, whereby all patients receive DUS and CEMRA (only proceeding to DSA if the CEMRA is positive and the DUS is negative), was most cost-effective. This was both the cheapest imaging and treatment strategy ($35,205 per patient) and yielded 6.1590 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), higher than three alternative imaging strategies. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that there was less than a 10% probability that imaging with either DUS or DSA alone are cost-effective at the conventional $50,000/QALY threshold. In conclusion, DSA is not cost-effective in the routine diagnostic workup of most patients. DUS, with additional imaging in the form of CEMRA, is recommended, with a strategy of ""CEMRA and selective DUS review"" being shown to be the optimal imaging strategy.

2772,Cost-effectiveness of antiplatelet agents in secondary stroke prevention: the limits of certainty,"Which of the available antiplatelet therapies should be preferred for secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke has been contentious. Objective: We applied the Duke Stroke Policy Model (DSPM) to reconsider this issue, paying particular attention to the degree of uncertainty in the estimates of their efficacy. The DSPM is a continuous-time simulation model of stroke development and outcome. Methods: We modified the inputs to reflect the cost of the drugs aspirin (ASA), extended release dipyridamole/aspirin (DP/A) and clopidogrel (CLO), as well as their relative risk in preventing subsequent ischemic stroke in comparison with placebo (PBO). These relative risks were derived from published reports from the second European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS-2) and Clopidogrel Versus Aspiring in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events studies. Precision was addressed by applying bootstrapping to the above estimates of relative risk. The target population was 70-year-old men with nondisabling stroke. The outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and costs per QALY. Results: Results of Base Case Analysis: In large part because of its modest drug cost, ASA was cost-effective in comparison with PBO. DP/A tended to have improved outcomes, but at increased costs. CLO was dominated in the base case. Results of sensitivity analysis: ASA and DP/A cannot be differentiated on a statistical basis alone. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, CLO was rarely preferred. Conclusions: Either DP/A or ASA appear to be a good value in comparison with no treatment, but there is no clear winner between the two.

Methods: We modified the inputs to reflect the cost of the drugs aspirin (ASA), extended release dipyridamole/aspirin (DP/A) and clopidogrel (CLO), as well as their relative risk in preventing subsequent ischemic stroke in comparison with placebo (PBO). These relative risks were derived from published reports from the second European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS-2) and Clopidogrel Versus Aspiring in Patients at Risk of Ischemic Events studies. Precision was addressed by applying bootstrapping to the above estimates of relative risk. The target population was 70-year-old men with nondisabling stroke. The outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and costs per QALY. Results: Results of Base Case Analysis: In large part because of its modest drug cost, ASA was cost-effective in comparison with PBO. DP/A tended to have improved outcomes, but at increased costs. CLO was dominated in the base case. Results of sensitivity analysis: ASA and DP/A cannot be differentiated on a statistical basis alone. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, CLO was rarely preferred. Conclusions: Either DP/A or ASA appear to be a good value in comparison with no treatment, but there is no clear winner between the two. In the absence of a definitive randomized trial, simulation modeling can help clarify the trade-offs between the various antiplatelet agents, but not beyond the constraints imposed by the imprecision in the estimates that can be obtained from the current evidence base.",2005-01-01206,16176495,Value Health,David B Matchar,2005,8 / 5,572-80,Yes,16176495,"David B Matchar; Gregory P Samsa; Suping Liu; Cost-effectiveness of antiplatelet agents in secondary stroke prevention: the limits of certainty, Value Health, 2005 Sep-Oct; 8(5):1098-3015; 572-80",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dipyridamole/aspirin as secondary prevention vs. Clopidogrel,Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,1769,United States,2003,2488.24
2776,Cost effectiveness of haemophilia treatment: a cross-national assessment,"The aim of this study was to assess the incremental cost effectiveness of on-demand versus prophylactic haemophilia therapy in Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and The Netherlands from the third-party payers' perspective. Using a decision tree model, the cost effectiveness of on-demand versus prophylactic therapy was analysed by extrapolating data from the European Haemophilia Economic Study to a 1-year analytic time horizon. Five hundred and six patients with severe haemophilia A and B, without inhibitors and at least 14 years of age, were enrolled in this study. Patients treated prophylactically had fewer bleeds than patients treated on-demand. With prophylactic treatment, the incremental cost per avoided bleeding ranged from 6,650 Euro dollars for patients 30 years of age or younger in Germany to 14,140 Euro dollars for patients over 30 years old in Sweden. If quality of life was taken into account, patients receiving prophylactic treatment had higher mean utilities than patients on on-demand therapy. The incremental effectiveness ratios in Germany were 1.2 million Euro dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained for patients 30 years or younger and HIV-positive and 2.2 million Euro dollars for patients 30 years or younger and HIV-negative. In the group aged over 30 years and HIV-positive the on-demand treatment strategy was dominant, whereas in the over 30 years/HIV-negative group the incremental cost-utility ratio was 4.7 million Euro dollars per quality-adjusted life year.

2789,Cost effectiveness of haemophilia treatment: a cross-national assessment,"The aim of this study was to assess the incremental cost effectiveness of on-demand versus prophylactic haemophilia therapy in Germany, Sweden, the United Kingdom and The Netherlands from the third-party payers' perspective. Using a decision tree model, the cost effectiveness of on-demand versus prophylactic therapy was analysed by extrapolating data from the European Haemophilia Economic Study to a 1-year analytic time horizon. Five hundred and six patients with severe haemophilia A and B, without inhibitors and at least 14 years of age, were enrolled in this study. Patients treated prophylactically had fewer bleeds than patients treated on-demand.

2790,Cost-effectiveness of pravastatin for primary prevention of coronary artery disease in Japan,"OBJECTIVE: This analysis was designed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of pravastatin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease in Japan. METHODS: A state-transition model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of pravastatin therapy with no intervention. Hypothetical cohorts were assumed according to patients' age, sex, initial serum total cholesterol (TC) levels, and other cardiac risk factors. For the baseline analysis, 20 mg/day of pravastatin was used for people aged 60 years who had an initial TC level of 240 mg/dl. Epidemiological, clinical, and economic data were collected from published articles. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in yen per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were calculated. To confirm the effects of different variables, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The assumptions of our model were in accordance with the Japan Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: ICERs were respectively 44 million and 76 million yen/QALY for men and women at low cardiac risk (i.e., the risks of hypercholesterolemia and old age) and 7.5 million and 4.3 million yen/QALY for those at high cardiac risk (i.e., the risks of hypercholesterolemia, old age, cigarette smoking, hypertension, and hyperglycemia).

2792,Helicobacter pylori-associated ulcer bleeding: should we test for eradication after treatment?,"BACKGROUND: Eradication of Helicobacter pylori after peptic ulcer haemorrhage reduces the risk of recurrence. Because H. pylori treatment is very effective, it is unclear whether testing to confirm eradication is worthwhile. AIMS: To examine whether patients with H. pylori-associated peptic ulcer haemorrhage should be tested for successful eradication after completion of antibiotic therapy. METHODS: A Markov cost-effectiveness model was developed to compare testing vs. non-testing of H. pylori eradication in peptic ulcer haemorrhage. Probability estimates and average costs were derived from published information. RESULTS: Testing for H. pylori eradication resulted in a benefit of 0.07 quality-adjusted life-years and cost 836 US dollars less than the strategy of not confirming eradication. Testing remained the superior strategy when varying the model regarding age, the initial success of eradication, various test and retreatment strategies, and the rate and costs of recurrent bleeding. Assuming a high eradication rate (95%), the test strategy becomes more expensive only if the cost of H. pylori testing reaches 265 US dollars; however, even under these conditions it remains cost-effective.

2793,Should mediastinoscopy actually be incorporated into the FDG PET strategy for patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma?,"BACKGROUND: Incorporating mediastinoscopy (MS) into the PET-based strategy for non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients might be cost-effective because MS can allow unnecessary thoracotomies to be avoided. The objective of our study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of incorporating MS into a PET strategy for NSCLC patients. METHODS: To determine life expectancy (LE), quality adjusted life years (QALY), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), a decision-tree sensitivity analysis was designed for histopathologically confirmed NSCLC patients with M0 disease, based on the three competing strategies of chest CT only vs. PET + CT vs. PET + CT + MS. A simulation of 1000 NSCLC patients was created using baselines of other relevant variables in regard to sensitivity, specificity, mortality, LE, utilities and cost from published data. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the influences of mediastinal metastasis prevalence on LE, QALY and ICER. RESULTS: The LE and QALY per patient in the CT only strategy, PET + CT strategy and PET + CT + MS strategy were 4.79 and 4.35, 5.33 and 4.93 and 5.68 and 5.33 years, respectively, with a 20% prevalence of mediastinal metastasis. The ICERs were 906.6 yen x 10(3) (7555 US dollars)/QALY/patient at a 20% mediastinal metastasis prevalence, and 2194 yen x 10(3) (18,282 US dollars)/QALY/patient at a 50% prevalence, but exceeded 5280 yen x 10(3) (44,000 US dollars)/QALY/ patient at 80%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study quantitatively showed the CT + PET + MS strategy in place of the PET + CT strategy in managing NSCLC patients to be cost-effective.

2795,Cost-effectiveness of low-molecular-weight heparin for treatment of pulmonary embolism,"BACKGROUND: Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) appears to be safe and effective for treating pulmonary embolism (PE), but its cost-effectiveness has not been assessed. METHODS: We built a Markov state-transition model to evaluate the medical and economic outcomes of a 6-day course with fixed-dose LMWH or adjusted-dose unfractionated heparin (UFH) in a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old patients with acute submassive PE. Probabilities for clinical outcomes were obtained from a meta-analysis of clinical trials. Cost estimates were derived from Medicare reimbursement data and other sources. The base-case analysis used an inpatient setting, whereas secondary analyses examined early discharge and outpatient treatment with LMWH. Using a societal perspective, strategies were compared based on lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Inpatient treatment costs were higher for LMWH treatment than for UFH (dollar 13,001 vs dollar 12,780), but LMWH yielded a greater number of QALYs than did UFH (7.677 QALYs vs 7.493 QALYs). The incremental costs of dollar 221 and the corresponding incremental effectiveness of 0.184 QALYs resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dollar 1,209/QALY. Our results were highly robust in sensitivity analyses. LMWH became cost-saving if the daily pharmacy costs for LMWH were < dollar 51, if > or = 8% of patients were eligible for early discharge, or if > or = 5% of patients could be treated entirely as outpatients. CONCLUSION: For inpatient treatment of PE, the use of LMWH is cost-effective compared to UFH.

2796,Screening to prevent polyoma virus nephropathy: a medical decision analysis,"Polyomavirus nephropathy (PVN) is an emerging medical dilemma in kidney transplantation. Methods to screen before clinical disease are available and early immunosuppression reduction may change the natural history of progression. However, the consequences of an increase in rejection may limit the benefits. In a simulation model a 'screen' versus 'no-screen' strategy was compared. Baseline PVN cumulative incidence was assumed to be 4%. Patients with PVN were modeled to have 4-fold higher risk of graft loss. In the screen strategy, patients positive for blood DNA PCR had their immunosuppression reduced. This pre-emptive change was modeled to reduce progression to overt PVN by 80%. Therapy reduction was associated with a 10% risk of precipitating acute rejection and greater risk of chronic allograft loss. In the baseline case, screening saved 1912 dollars (discounted) and produced 0.020 more quality adjusted life years (QALYs) than not screening. Screening resulted in decreased net QALYs if the false positive viremia rate was >9.5% and the PVN incidence was <2.1%. Much of the cost savings of screening relate to savings from immunosuppression reduction in the screened arm. Screening may well be cost-effective if not cost saving in centers with high PVN rates.

2797,Pharmacogenetic testing in the clinical management of schizophrenia: a decision-analytic model,"Clinical application of pharmacogenetic testing has been proposed as a means of improving treatment outcomes in psychiatry. The identification of a putative genetic test for better clozapine response in schizophrenia offers an opportunity to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of such testing. The authors performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of a genetic test that may identify individuals with greater likelihood of responding to clozapine treatment. We modeled a target population of schizophrenia patients in an acute psychotic episode, using a lifetime time horizon and societal perspective. Outcome measures included life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Effects of variations in testing parameters were also examined. For a 30-year-old with schizophrenia, applying the pharmacogenetic test and treating those predicted to respond to clozapine with clozapine-first cost US $47,705 per additional quality-adjusted life-year, compared with treating all patients with conventional agents and reserving clozapine for treatment-resistant patients. In 1-way sensitivity analyses, test sensitivity and cost had the greatest impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness. We conclude that pharmacogenetic tests may achieve utility in clinical psychiatry, although their cost-effectiveness depends on several clinical parameters.

Drug therapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with epilepsy, but therapies vary widely in their mechanism of action and acquisition cost. This article describes a decision model developed for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom. It compares the long-term cost-effectiveness of drugs licensed in adults for use in 3 situations: monotherapy for newly diagnosed patients, monotherapy for refractory patients, and combination therapy for refractory patients. The analysis separately considers the treatment of partial and generalized seizures. The full range of pharmaceutical therapies feasibly used in the UK health system was included in the analysis. The analysis showed that, on the basis of existing evidence, for newly diagnosed patients with partial seizures, carbamazepine and valproate are likely to be the most cost-effective mono-therapies. Carbamazepine is likely to be the most cost-effective 2nd-line monotherapy for refractory patients, and oxcarbazepine would probably be the most cost-effective adjunctive therapy for refractory patients if the willingness to pay for additional health benefits is greater than pound18,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). For patients with generalized seizures, valproate is most likely to be cost-effective for newly diagnosed patients. For refractory patients, adjunctive topiramate is more cost-effective than monotherapy alone if the willingness to pay for additional health benefits is greater than pound35,000 per QALY.
