10901,Cost-effectiveness of a 10- versus 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Denmark and Sweden,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of a 7-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PCV7) had profound public health effects across the globe. PCV7 vaccination in a national immunization program is generally considered cost-effective and potentially cost-saving. Two new PCVs have been launched, a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) and a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13). OBJECTIVE: This article examines the public health and economic effects of pediatric national immunization programs of PCV10 and PCV13 in Denmark and Sweden. METHODS: A previously published decision-analytic model was used to estimate the impact of PCV10 and PCV13 on reducing cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia (PNE), and acute otitis media (AOM) by using country-specific incidence, serotype coverage, disease sequelae, mortality, vaccine effectiveness, indirect effects, costs, and utilities. Direct effects for PCV13- and PCV10-covered serotypes were assumed similar to PCV7. PCV13 was assumed to confer an indirect effect, similar to PCV7, whereas PCV10 was not. Assumptions were tested in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: PCV13 is expected to save 280.7 million DKK (Danish kroner) in Denmark and 288.2 million SEK (Swedish kronor) in Sweden in direct costs compared with a vaccination program with PCV10. In both Denmark and Sweden, the results of this study indicate that, compared with PCV10, PCV13 will have a greater impact on disease in life-years gained (LYG), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, IPD cases avoided, PNE cases avoided, AOM cases avoided, and in deaths avoided. For Denmark PCV13, it was estimated to result in 10,051 LYG; 9063 QALYs gained; 237 additional IPD cases avoided; 12,094 additional PNE cases avoided; 958 additional cases of AOM avoided; and 882 additional deaths avoided. For Sweden PCV13, it was estimated to result in 4245 LYG; 3953 QALYs gained; 379 additional IPD cases avoided; 8210 additional PNE cases avoided; 1459 additional cases of AOM avoided; and 378 additional deaths avoided. In all sensitivity analyses, PCV13 was less costly and more effective compared with PCV10. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, a national immunization program with PCV13 was found to be good value for money and estimated to prevent additional cases of disease among children and nonvaccinated individuals and save additional costs due to treatment of pneumococcal disease, when compared with PCV10 in Denmark and Sweden.",2013-01-10743,23312274,Clin Ther,Rogier M Klok,2013,35 / 2,119-34,Yes,23312274,"Rogier M Klok; Rose-Marie Lindkvist; Mats Ekelund; Raymond A Farkouh; David R Strutton; Cost-effectiveness of a 10- versus 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Denmark and Sweden, Clin Ther, ; 35(2):1879-114X; 119-34",QALY,Denmark,Not Stated,Not Stated,National immunization programs (NIPs) with 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PCV13) vs. NIP containing PCV10,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,3.00,-30972.08,Denmark,2012,-6031.6

10903,Cost-effectiveness of adjuvant FOLFOX and 5FU/LV chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon cancer,"PURPOSE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin (5FU/LV), and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) compared with 5FU/LV alone and 5FU/LV compared with observation alone for patients who had resected stage II colon cancer. METHODS: We developed 2 Markov models to represent the adjuvant chemotherapy and follow-up periods and a single Markov model to represent the observation group. We used calibration to estimate the transition probabilities among different toxicity levels. The base case considered 60-year-old patients who had undergone an uncomplicated hemicolectomy for stage II colon cancer and were medically fit to receive 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy. We measured health outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and estimated costs using 2007 US dollars. RESULTS: In the base case, adjuvant chemotherapy of the FOLFOX regimen had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $54,359/QALY compared with the 5FU/LV regimen, and the 5FU/LV regimen had an ICER of $14,584/QALY compared with the observation group from the third-party payer perspective. The ICER values were most sensitive to 5-year relapse probability, cost of adjuvant chemotherapy, and the discount rate for the FOLFOX arm, whereas the ICER value of 5FU/LV was most sensitive to the 5-year relapse probability, 5-year survival probability, and the relapse cost. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that the ICER of 5FU/LV is less than $50,000/QALY with a probability of 99.62%, and the ICER of FOLFOX as compared with 5FU/LV is less than $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY with a probability of 44.48% and 97.24%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Although adjuvant chemotherapy with 5FU/LV is cost-effective at all ages for patients who have undergone an uncomplicated hemicolectomy for stage II colon cancer, FOLFOX is not likely to be cost-effective as compared with 5FU/LV.",2013-01-10746,23313932,Med Decis Making,Mehmet U S Ayvaci,2013,33 / 4,521-32,No,23313932,"Mehmet U S Ayvaci; Jinghua Shi; Oguzhan Alagoz; Sam J Lubner; Cost-effectiveness of adjuvant FOLFOX and 5FU/LV chemotherapy for patients with stage II colon cancer, Med Decis Making, ; 33(4):0272-989X; 521-32",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"5-fluorouracil, leucovorin (5FU/LV) and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) vs. 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin (5FU/LV)",undergone an uncomplicated hemicolectomy,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,54359,United States,2007,67852.66

10905,Health economic evaluation of the Lund Integrated Medicines Management Model (LIMM) in elderly patients admitted to hospital,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of a multidisciplinary team including a pharmacist for systematic medication review and reconciliation from admission to discharge at hospital among elderly patients (the Lund Integrated Medicines Management (LIMM)) in order to reduce drug-related readmissions and outpatient visits. METHOD: Published data from the LIMM project group were used to design a probabilistic decision tree model for evaluating tools for (1) a systematic medication reconciliation and review process at initial hospital admission and during stay (admission part) and (2) a medication report for patients discharged from hospital to primary care (discharge part). The comparator was standard care. Inpatient, outpatient and staff time costs (Euros, 2009) were calculated during a 3-month period. Dis-utilities for hospital readmissions and outpatient visits due to medication errors were taken from the literature. RESULTS: The total cost for the LIMM model was euro290 compared to euro630 for standard care, in spite of a euro39 intervention cost. The main cost offset arose from avoided drug-related readmissions in the Admission part (euro262) whereas only euro66 was offset in the Discharge part as a result of fewer outpatient visits and correction time. The reduced disutility was estimated to 0.005 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), indicating that LIMM was a dominant alternative. The probability that the intervention would be cost-effective at a zero willingness to pay for a gained QALY compared to standard care was estimated to 98%. CONCLUSIONS: The LIMM medication reconciliation (at admission and discharge) and medication review was both cost-saving and generated greater utility compared to standard care, foremost owing to avoided drug-related hospital readmissions. When implementing such a review process with a multidisciplinary team, it may be important to consider a learning curve in order to capture the full advantage.",2013-01-10749,23315436,BMJ Open,Ola Ghatnekar,2013,3 / 1,,No,23315436,"Ola Ghatnekar; Asa Bondesson; Ulf Persson; Tommy Eriksson; Health economic evaluation of the Lund Integrated Medicines Management Model (LIMM) in elderly patients admitted to hospital, BMJ Open , ; 3(1):2044-6055",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lund Integrated Medicines Management (LIMM)- systematic patient centered and team-based activities and structured tools for medication review medication reconciliation to reduce drug-related readmissions and outpatient visits vs. Standard/Usual care,Elderly patients admitted to hospital,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-68000,Euro,2009,-114317.08
10906,"Effectiveness of active case-finding strategies in tuberculosis control in Kampala, Uganda","BACKGROUND: Passive case finding (PCF) is the strategy implemented by most developing countries to detect new cases of tuberculosis (TB), but detection rates remain low. Active case finding (ACF) is an alternative strategy, although cost is a barrier to implementation. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of a city-wide ACF programme in Kampala, Uganda, compared to the PCF strategy. METHODS: We developed a decision tree and Markov model to compare ACF vs. PCF across several outcome measures. Parameter estimates for costs, probabilities and utility scores were obtained from published reports and peer-reviewed journal articles. The main outcome measures were TB cases detected, deaths averted, life years saved (LYS) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Our model found that ACF implemented city-wide would result in an additional 1594 TB cases detected in 1 year, 675 deaths averted over a 5-year period, 21,928 LYS, and would cost an additional US$109 per additional QALY.

10913,"Effectiveness of active case-finding strategies in tuberculosis control in Kampala, Uganda","BACKGROUND: Passive case finding (PCF) is the strategy implemented by most developing countries to detect new cases of tuberculosis (TB), but detection rates remain low. Active case finding (ACF) is an alternative strategy, although cost is a barrier to implementation. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of a city-wide ACF programme in Kampala, Uganda, compared to the PCF strategy. METHODS: We developed a decision tree and Markov model to compare ACF vs. PCF across several outcome measures. Parameter estimates for costs, probabilities and utility scores were obtained from published reports and peer-reviewed journal articles. The main outcome measures were TB cases detected, deaths averted, life years saved (LYS) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Our model found that ACF implemented city-wide would result in an additional 1594 TB cases detected in 1 year, 675 deaths averted over a 5-year period, 21,928 LYS, and would cost an additional US$109 per additional QALY. The 25-34 year age group received most health benefits (556 cases detected, 229 deaths averted, 8058 LYS), and the programme was most cost-effective in the 45-54 year age group (US$51/QALY).

10914,Economic savings versus health losses: the cost-effectiveness of generic antiretroviral therapy in the United States,"BACKGROUND: U.S. HIV treatment guidelines recommend branded once-daily, 1-pill efavirenz-emtricitabine-tenofovir as first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). With the anticipated approval of generic efavirenz in the United States, a once-daily, 3-pill alternative (generic efavirenz, generic lamivudine, and tenofovir) will decrease cost but may reduce adherence and virologic suppression. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effect, costs, and cost-effectiveness of a 3-pill, generic-based regimen compared with a branded, coformulated regimen and to project the potential national savings in the first year of a switch to generic-based ART. DESIGN: Mathematical simulation of HIV disease. SETTING: United States. PATIENTS: HIV-infected persons. INTERVENTION: No ART (for comparison); 3-pill, generic-based ART; and branded ART. MEASUREMENTS: Quality-adjusted life expectancy, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Compared with no ART, generic-based ART has an ICER of $21,100/QALY. Compared with generic-based ART, branded ART increases lifetime costs by $42,500 and per-person survival gains by 0.37 QALYs for an ICER of $114,800/QALY.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to calculate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran vs VKAs in Belgium, whereby warfarin was considered representative for the VKA class. Efficacy and safety data were taken from the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE-LY) trial and a network meta-analysis. Local resource use and unit costs were included in the model. Effectiveness was expressed in Quality Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs). The model outcomes were total costs, total QALYs, incremental costs, incremental QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The level of International Normalized Ratio (INR) control and the use of other antithrombotic therapies observed in Belgian clinical practice were reflected in two scenario analyses. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, total costs per patient were euro13,333 for dabigatran and euro12,454 for warfarin. Total QALYs per patient were 9.51 for dabigatran and 9.19 for warfarin. The corresponding ICER was euro2807/QALY. The ICER of dabigatran was euro970/QALY vs warfarin with real-world INR control and euro5296/QALY vs a mix of warfarin, aspirin, and no treatment. Results were shown to be robust in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. LIMITATIONS: The analysis does not include long-term costs for clinical events, as these data were not available for Belgium. As in any economic model based on data from a randomized clinical trial, several assumptions had to be made when extrapolating results to routine clinical practice in Belgium.

10921,Minimally invasive versus open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for degenerative spondylolisthesis: comparative effectiveness and cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS TLIF) for lumbar spondylolisthesis allows for the surgical treatment of back/leg pain while minimizing tissue injury and accelerating the patient''s recovery. Although previous results have shown shorter hospital stays and decreased intraoperative blood loss for MIS versus open TLIF, short- and long-term outcomes have been similar. Therefore, we performed comparative effectiveness and cost-utility analysis for MIS versus open TLIF. METHODS: A total of 100 patients (50 MIS, 50 open) undergoing TLIF for lumbar spondylolisthesis were prospectively studied. Back-related medical resource use, missed work, and quality-adjusted life years were assessed. Cost of in-patient care, direct cost (2-year resource use x unit costs based on Medicare national allowable payment amounts), and indirect cost (work-day losses x self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate) were recorded, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. RESULTS: Length of hospitalization and time to return to work were less for MIS versus open TLIF (P = 0.006 and P = 0.03, respectively). MIS versus open TLIF demonstrated similar improvement in patient-reported outcomes assessed. MIS versus open TLIF was associated with a reduction in mean hospital cost of $1758, indirect cost of $8474, and total 2-year societal cost of $9295 (P = 0.03) but similar 2-year direct health care cost and quality-adjusted life years gained. CONCLUSIONS: MIS TLIF resulted in reduced operative blood loss, hospital stay and 2-year cost, and accelerated return to work. Surgical morbidity, hospital readmission, and short- and long-term clinical effectiveness were similar between MIS and open TLIF.

METHODS: An extensively studied and improved dynamic model is used to estimate primary and breakthrough chickenpox and zoster cases over time. For a range of vaccination options, we compared the direct costs (health care payer perspective) and health outcomes (including Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) lost) associated with chickenpox and herpes zoster. Estimates of social contact patterns, health care use, costs and QALY losses are almost exclusively based on Belgian databases and surveys. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: If exogenous natural boosting exists, a net loss in QALYs is expected for several decades after implementing a universal chickenpox vaccination programme, due to an increase in zoster mainly in persons aged 50-80 y. This result holds also for scenarios that minimise or counteract the expected increase in zoster incidence (e.g. additional booster vaccinations in adults). However, if the boosting hypothesis is not true or if costs and QALYs are cumulated over at least 33 to more than 100 y after vaccination (depending on the assumptions made), different options for universal 2-dose vaccination against chickenpox in Belgium would be cost-effective at a vaccine price of euro43/dose or lower.",2013-01-10759,23321955,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Joke Bilcke,2013,9 / 4,,No,23321955,"Joke Bilcke; Albert Jan van Hoek; Philippe Beutels; Childhood varicella-zoster virus vaccination in Belgium: cost-effective only in the long run or without exogenous boosting?, Hum Vaccin Immunother , 2013 Apr; 9(4):2164-554X",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,2 doses of varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine at age 1 and 11 (95% and 80% coverage respectively) vs. No universal vaccination,assuming no exogenous boosting,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,1.50,19207,Euro,2011,30752.83

10924,Childhood varicella-zoster virus vaccination in Belgium: cost-effective only in the long run or without exogenous boosting?,"AIM: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a universal childhood varicella-zoster vaccination programme in Belgium (1) using the most recent Belgian data on varicella-zoster burden, (2) exploring different options for the timing of the second dose, (3) obtaining results with and without exogenous natural boosting, and (4) investigating the possible additional benefit of zoster booster vaccination for adults at age 50 or 60 y. METHODS: An extensively studied and improved dynamic model is used to estimate primary and breakthrough chickenpox and zoster cases over time. For a range of vaccination options, we compared the direct costs (health care payer perspective) and health outcomes (including Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) lost) associated with chickenpox and herpes zoster. Estimates of social contact patterns, health care use, costs and QALY losses are almost exclusively based on Belgian databases and surveys. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: If exogenous natural boosting exists, a net loss in QALYs is expected for several decades after implementing a universal chickenpox vaccination programme, due to an increase in zoster mainly in persons aged 50-80 y. This result holds also for scenarios that minimise or counteract the expected increase in zoster incidence (e.g. additional booster vaccinations in adults). However, if the boosting hypothesis is not true or if costs and QALYs are cumulated over at least 33 to more than 100 y after vaccination (depending on the assumptions made), different options for universal 2-dose vaccination against chickenpox in Belgium would be cost-effective at a vaccine price of euro43/dose or lower.",2013-01-10759,23321955,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Joke Bilcke,2013,9 / 4,,No,23321955,"Joke Bilcke; Albert Jan van Hoek; Philippe Beutels; Childhood varicella-zoster virus vaccination in Belgium: cost-effective only in the long run or without exogenous boosting?, Hum Vaccin Immunother , 2013 Apr; 9(4):2164-554X",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Single dose of varicella zoster virus (VZV) vaccine at age 1 vs. No universal vaccination,assuming no exogenous boosting,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,1.50,8103,Euro,2011,12973.92

10927,Cost-effectiveness of dronedarone and standard of care compared with standard of care alone: US results of an ATHENA lifetime model,"BACKGROUND: The first antiarrhythmic drug to demonstrate a reduced rate of cardiovascular hospitalization in atrial fibrillation/flutter (AF/AFL) patients was dronedarone in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel arm Trial to assess the efficacy of dronedarone 400 mg bid for the prevention of cardiovascular Hospitalization or death from any cause in patiENts with Atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (ATHENA trial). The potential cost-effectiveness of dronedarone in this patient population has not been reported in a US context. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of dronedarone from a US health care payers'' perspective. METHODS AND RESULTS: ATHENA patient data were applied to a patient-level health state transition model. Probabilities of health state transitions were derived from ATHENA and published data. Associated costs used in the model (2010 values) were obtained from published sources when trial data were not available. The base-case model assumed that patients were treated with dronedarone for the duration of ATHENA (mean 21 months) and were followed over a lifetime. Cost-effectiveness, from the payers'' perspective, was determined using a Monte Carlo microsimulation (1 million fictitious patients). Dronedarone plus standard care provided 0.13 life years gained (LYG), and 0.11 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), over standard care alone; cost/QALY was $19,520 and cost/LYG was $16,930. Compared to lower risk patients, patients at higher risk of stroke (Congestive heart failure, history of Hypertension, Age >/= 75 years, Diabetes mellitus, and past history of Stroke or transient ischemic attack (CHADS(2)) scores 3-6 versus 0) had a lower cost/QALY ($9580-$16,000 versus $26,450). Cost/QALY was highest in scenarios assuming lifetime dronedarone therapy, no cardiovascular mortality benefit, no cost associated with AF/AFL recurrence on standard care, and when discounting of 5% was compared with 0%.

10928,Cost-effectiveness of supported self-management for CFS/ME patients in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Nurse led self-help treatments for people with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalitis (CFS/ME) have been shown to be effective in reducing fatigue but their cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a single blind randomised controlled trial comparing pragmatic rehabilitation (PR) and supportive listening (SL) delivered by primary care nurses, and treatment as usual (TAU) delivered by the general practitioner (GP) in North West England. A within trial analysis was conducted comparing the costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) measured within the time frame of the trial. 296 patients aged 18 and over with CFS/ME diagnosed using the Oxford criteria were included in the cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Treatment as usual is less expensive and leads to better patient outcomes compared with Supportive Listening. Treatment as usual is also less expensive than Pragmatic Rehabilitation. PR was effective at reducing fatigue in the short term, but the impact of the intervention on QALYs was uncertain. However, based on the results of this trial, PR is unlikely to be cost-effective in this patient population. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support the introduction of SL. Any benefits generated by PR are unlikely to be of sufficient magnitude to warrant recommending PR for this patient group on cost-effectiveness grounds alone.

10930,Cost-effectiveness of continuation maintenance pemetrexed after cisplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy for advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer: estimates from the perspective of the Chinese health care system,"BACKGROUND: Continuation maintenance treatment with pemetrexed is approved by current clinical guidelines as a category 2A recommendation after induction therapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy (CP strategy) for patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the cost-effectiveness of the treatment remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We completed a trial-based assessment, from the perspective of the Chinese health care system, of the cost-effectiveness of maintenance pemetrexed treatment after a CP strategy for patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate costs and benefits. It was based on a clinical trial that compared continuation maintenance pemetrexed therapy plus best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo plus BSC after a CP strategy for advanced nonsquamous NSCLC. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the stability of the model. RESULTS: The model base case analysis suggested that continuation maintenance pemetrexed therapy after a CP strategy would increase benefits in a 1-, 2-, 5-, or 10-year time horizon, with incremental costs of $183,589.06, $126,353.16, $124,766.68, and $124,793.12 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. The most sensitive influential variable in the cost-effectiveness analysis was the utility of the progression-free survival state, followed by proportion of patients with postdiscontinuation therapy in both arms, proportion of BSC costs for PFS versus progressed survival state, and cost of pemetrexed. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost-effective probability of adding continuation maintenance pemetrexed therapy to BSC was zero. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed that the Markov model was robust. CONCLUSIONS: Continuation maintenance of pemetrexed after a CP strategy for patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC is not cost-effective based on a recent clinical trial. Decreasing the price or adjusting the dosage of pemetrexed may be a better option for meeting the treatment demands of Chinese patients.",2013-01-10769,23328269,Clin Ther,Xiaohui Zeng,2013,35 / 1,54-65,Yes,23328269,"Xiaohui Zeng; Liubao Peng; Jianhe Li; Gannong Chen; Chongqing Tan; Siying Wang; Xiaomin Wan; Lihui Ouyang; Ziying Zhao; Cost-effectiveness of continuation maintenance pemetrexed after cisplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy for advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer: estimates from the perspective of the Chinese health care system, Clin Ther, ; 35(1):1879-114X; 54-65",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Maintenance pemetrexed therapy plus best supportive care after induction therapy with premetrexed plus cisplatin after 10 years vs. Best supportive care only after induction therapy with premetrexed plus cisplatin after 10 years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,"10 Years, 1, 2, and 5 years",3.00,3.00,124793.12,United States,2010,148117.14
10931,Cost-utility of a psychoeducational intervention in fibromyalgia patients compared with usual care: an economic evaluation alongside a 12-month randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of adding psychoeducational treatment implemented in general practice to usual care for patients with fibromyalgia (FM), and to analyze the cost-utility of the intervention from health care and societal perspectives. METHODS: Twelve-month randomized controlled trial. A total of 216 primary care patients meeting the American College of Rheumatology criteria for FM participated in the study. The intervention included 9, 2-hour sessions of psychoeducation (5 sessions of education about the illness+4 sessions of autogenic relaxation) added to usual care provided by a multidisciplinary group in general practice was compared to usual care in the public health system. RESULTS: At 12-month follow-up, patients who received psychoeducation showed greater improvement in global functional status (Cohen d=0.36; -2.49 to 3.81), physical functioning (Cohen d=0.56; 0.08 to 1.00), days feeling well (Cohen d=0.40; -0.16 to 1.02), pain (Cohen d= 0.35; -0.04 to 0.80), morning fatigue (Cohen d=0.24; -0.20 to 0.76), stiffness (Cohen d=0.34; -0.10 to 0.87), and depression (Cohen d=0.30; -0.26 to 0.93). Mean incremental cost per person receiving the intervention was &OV0556;-215.49 (-615.13 to 287.81) from the health care perspective, and &OV0556;-197.32 (-785.12 to 395.74) from the societal perspective. The incremental gain in quality-adjusted life-years per person was 0.12 (0.06 to 0.19), yielding a ""dominant"" intervention from both perspectives. The sensitivity analysis suggested that the intervention was cost-effective even imputing all missing data.

The Aberdeen Health Technology Assessment Group were commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and NICE''s subsequent decisions. The objective of this paper is to summarize the independent review and critique of the evidence submitted for the consideration of the NICE Appraisal Committee and NICE''s subsequently issued guidance. The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology based upon the manufacturer''s submission to NICE. The ERG also independently searched for relevant evidence and modified the manufacturer''s decision analytic model to examine the impact of altering some of the key assumptions. For progression-free survival (PFS), there was a statistically significant longer survival for pazopanib compared with placebo (as assessed by the ERG, based upon the original manufacturer submission with a clinical cut-off date of 23 May 2008) [median 11.1 vs. 2.8 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.40; 95 % CI 0.27, 0.60]. Data from the indirect comparison suggested that pazopanib had a greater survival than interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) [HR 0.512; 95 % CI 0.326, 0.802] but provided no evidence of any difference compared with sunitinib (HR 0.949; 95 % CI 0.575, 1.568). With regard to overall survival, 64 % (n = 99) of patients in the pazopanib arm and 63 % (n = 49) of patients in the placebo arm had died and a total of 51 % (n = 40) of placebo patients had crossed over to receive pazopanib. Although data were provided on an intention-to-treat basis, crossover between therapies made such data difficult to interpret. There was no evidence of any statistically significant difference between pazopanib and best supportive care (HR 0.501; 95 % CI 0.136, 2.348).

10945,"Cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis interventions for ""incidental"" vertebral fractures","BACKGROUND: Vertebral fractures detected ""incidentally"" by chest radiograph usually do not trigger osteoporosis treatment in older patients. In a 3-arm controlled trial we reported that both physician-directed and enhanced (physician plus patient activation) interventions increased treatment rates more than 10-fold (15%-20% absolute increases) compared with usual care; the cost-effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. METHODS: Incremental cost-effectiveness of these 2 interventions compared with usual care was assessed using a Markov decision-analytic model, populated with 1-year outcomes data and direct intervention costs from the trial. Costs were expressed in 2009 Canadian dollars and effectiveness based on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The perspective was health care payer; horizon was projected lifetime; costs and benefits were discounted at 3%; and deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Per patient, the physician and enhanced interventions cost $34 and $42, respectively. Compared with usual care, for every 1000 patients exposed to the physican intervention there were 4 fewer fractures, 8 more QALYs gained, and $282,000 saved. Compared with physician interventions, for every 1000 patients exposed to enhanced interventions there were 6 fewer fractures, 6 more QALYs gained, and $339,000 saved. Both interventions dominated usual care and were cost-effective in ~80% of 10,000 probabilistic simulations. Although the enhanced intervention cost $8 more per patient, it still dominated the physician intervention and usual care, and was the most economically attractive option. CONCLUSIONS: Pragmatic and inexpensive interventions directed at patients with incidentally detected vertebral fractures and their physicians are highly cost-effective at improving osteoporosis treatment, and in most circumstances also are cost-saving.",2013-01-10774,23331449,Am J Med,Sumit R Majumdar,2013,126 / 2,169.e9-17,No,23331449,"Sumit R Majumdar; Douglas A Lier; Finlay A McAlister; Brian H Rowe; Kerry Siminoski; David A Hanley; Anthony S Russell; Jeffrey A Johnson; Cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis interventions for ""incidental"" vertebral fractures, Am J Med, ; 126(2):0002-9343; 169.e9-17",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Incidental vertebral fractures detection on routine chest radiography followed by enhanced intervention including physician plus patient activation strategy (consisting of written educational materials and telephone-based osteoporosis counseling by a nurse practitioner) as well as the physician intervention vs. Physician intervention consisting of opinion-leader-endorsed evidence summaries and treatment guidelines and patient-specific reminders that were faxed, e-mailed, or mailed along with the official chest radiograph report",Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-56500,Canada,2009,-60004.02
10946,Cost-effectiveness of school support for orphan girls to prevent HIV infection in Zimbabwe,"This cost-effectiveness study analyzes the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in a randomized controlled trial that tested school support as a structural intervention to prevent HIV risk factors among Zimbabwe orphan girl adolescents. The intervention significantly reduced early marriage, increased years of schooling completed, and increased health-related quality of life. By reducing early marriage, the literature suggests the intervention reduced HIV infection. The intervention yielded an estimated US$1,472 in societal benefits and an estimated gain of 0.36 QALYs per orphan supported. It cost an estimated US$6/QALY gained, about 1 % of annual per capita income in Zimbabwe. That is well below the maximum price that the World Health Organization (WHO) Commission on Macroeconomics and Health recommends paying for health gains in low and middle income countries. About half the girls in the intervention condition were boarded when they reached high school. For non-boarders, the intervention''s financial benefits exceeded its costs, yielding an estimated net cost savings of $502 per pupil. Without boarding, the intervention would yield net savings even if it were 34 % less effective in replication. Boarding was not cost-effective. It cost an additional $1,234 per girl boarded (over the 3 years of the study, discounted to present value at a 3 % discount rate) but had no effect on any of the outcome measures relative to girls in the treatment group who did not board. For girls who did not board, the average cost of approximately 3 years of school support was US$973.",2013-01-10779,23334923,Prev Sci,Ted Miller,2013,14 / 5,,No,23334923,"Ted Miller; Denise Hallfors; Hyunsan Cho; Winnie Luseno; Geetha Waehrer; Cost-effectiveness of school support for orphan girls to prevent HIV infection in Zimbabwe, Prev Sci, 2013 Oct; 14(5):1573-6695",QALY,Zimbabwe,Not Stated,Not Stated,School Support for orphan girls in both boarding and non boarding schools for HIV prevention vs. Standard/usual care,Not Stated,40 Years,19 Years,Female,Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,6,United States,2010,7.12
10947,Cost-effectiveness of gene-expression profiling for tumor-site origin,"OBJECTIVES: Gene-expression profiling (GEP) reliably supplements traditional clinicopathological information on the tissue of origin (TOO) in metastatic or poorly differentiated cancer. A cost-effectiveness analysis of GEP TOO testing versus usual care was conducted from a US third-party payer perspective. METHODS: Data on recommendation changes for chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, blood tests, imaging investigations, and hospice care were obtained from a retrospective, observational study of patients whose physicians received GEP TOO test results. The effects of chemotherapy recommendation changes on survival were based on the results of trials cited in National Comprehensive Cancer Network and UpToDate guidelines. Drug and administration costs were based on average doses reported in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Other unit costs came from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee schedules. Quality-of-life weights were obtained from literature. Bootstrap analysis estimated sample variability; probabilistic sensitivity analysis addressed parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Chemotherapy regimen recommendations consistent with guidelines for final tumor-site diagnoses increased significantly from 42% to 65% (net difference 23%; P<0.001). Projected overall survival increased from 15.9 to 19.5 months (mean difference 3.6 months; two-sided 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.2-3.9). The average increase in quality-adjusted life-months was 2.7 months (95% CI 1.5-4.3), and average third-party payer costs per patient increased by $10,360 (95% CI $2,982-$19,192). The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $46,858 (95% CI $13,351-$104,269). CONCLUSIONS: GEP TOO testing significantly altered clinical practice patterns and is projected to increase overall survival, quality-adjusted life-years, and costs, resulting in an expected cost per quality-adjusted life-year of less than $50,000.",2013-01-10784,23337215,Value Health,John Hornberger,2013,16 / 1,46-56,Yes,23337215,"John Hornberger; Irina Degtiar; Hialy Gutierrez; Ashwini Shewade; W David Henner; Shawn Becker; Gauri Varadhachary; Stephen Raab; Cost-effectiveness of gene-expression profiling for tumor-site origin, Value Health, ; 16(1):1098-3015; 46-56",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Gene-expression profiling (GEP) on the tissue of origin (GEPTOOtesting) vs. Standard/Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,46858,United States,2011,53914.02

10952,Gastric bypass is a cost-saving procedure: results from a comprehensive Markov model,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing public health problem in industrialized countries and is directly and indirectly responsible for almost 10% of all health expenditures. Bariatric surgery is the best available treatment, however, associated with important economical expenditures. So, cost-effectiveness analysis of the available surgical options is paramount.

The Markov model was constructed to allow for the evaluation of the impact of several obesity-related comorbidities. The results were derived for a representative population of morbidly obese patients, and subgroup analyses were performed for patients without comorbidities, patients with diabetes mellitus, different age, and body mass index (BMI) groups. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed accounting for lifetime costs and from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Gastric bypass is a dominant strategy, rendering a significant decrease in lifetime costs and increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs).

10957,Gastric bypass is a cost-saving procedure: results from a comprehensive Markov model,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a growing public health problem in industrialized countries and is directly and indirectly responsible for almost 10% of all health expenditures. Bariatric surgery is the best available treatment, however, associated with important economical expenditures. So, cost-effectiveness analysis of the available surgical options is paramount. METHODS: We developed a Markov model for three different strategies: best medical management, gastric band, and gastric bypass. The Markov model was constructed to allow for the evaluation of the impact of several obesity-related comorbidities. The results were derived for a representative population of morbidly obese patients, and subgroup analyses were performed for patients without comorbidities, patients with diabetes mellitus, different age, and body mass index (BMI) groups. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed accounting for lifetime costs and from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Gastric bypass is a dominant strategy, rendering a significant decrease in lifetime costs and increase in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Comparing with the best medical management, in the global population of patients with a BMI of > 35 kg/m2, gastric bypass renders 1.9 extra QALYs and saves on average 13,244euro per patient. Younger patients, patients with a BMI between 40 and 50 kg/m2, and patients without obesity-related diseases are the ones with a bigger benefit in terms of cost effectiveness.

This serious pharmacoeconomic question has to be answered by the nation''s health economists. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of drugs from 4 classes of antihypertensive medications commonly used in Nigeria in management of hypertension without compelling indication to use a particular antihypertensive drug. METHODS: The study employed decision analytic modeling. Interventions were obtained from a meta-analysis. The Markov process model calculated clinical outcomes and costs during a life cycle of 30 years of 1000 hypertensive patients stratified by 3 cardiovascular risk groups, under the alternative intervention scenarios. Quality adjusted life year (QALY) was used to quantify clinical outcome. The average cost of treatment for the 1000 patient was tracked over the Markov cycle model of the alternative interventions and results were presented in 2010 US Dollars. Probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulation, and results presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability frontiers. Expected value of perfect information (EVPI) and expected value of parameter perfect information (EVPPI) analyses were also conducted for the hypothetical population. RESULTS: Thiazide diuretic was the most cost-effective option across the 3 cardiovascular risk groups.

10964,Evaluating the translation process of an Internet-based self-help intervention for prevention of depression: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Depression is common and treatable with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), for example. However, access to this therapy is limited. Internet-based interventions have been found to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression. The International Society for Research on Internet Interventions has highlighted the importance of translating effective Internet programs into multiple languages to enable worldwide dissemination. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to determine if it would be cost effective to translate an existing English-language Internet-based intervention for use in a non-English-speaking country. METHODS: This paper reports an evaluation of a trial in which a research group in Norway translated two English-language Internet-based interventions into Norwegian (MoodGYM and BluePages) that had previously been shown to reduce symptoms of depression. The translation process and estimates of the cost-effectiveness of such a translation process is described. Estimated health effect was found by using quality-adjusted life years (QALY). RESULTS: Conservative estimates indicate that for every 1000 persons treated, 16 QALYs are gained. The investment is returned 9 times and the cost-effectiveness ratio (CER) is 3432. The costs of the translation project totaled to approximately 27% of the estimated original English-language version development costs. CONCLUSIONS: The economic analysis shows that the cost-effectiveness of the translation project was substantial.

Currently, the issue of cost-effectiveness is entirely unresolved. METHODS: A decision analysis was carried out based on the results of a systematic literature review of articles concerning recurrent inguinal hernia repair that were published between 1979 and 2011. A virtual cohort was programmed to undergo three different treatment procedures: (1) laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal hernia repair (TEP), (2) open preperitoneal mesh repair according to Stoppa, and (3) open preperitoneal mesh repair according to Nyhus. We carried out a base-case analysis and varied all variables over a broad range of reasonable hypotheses in multiple one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses.

10967,More donors or more delayed graft function? A cost-effectiveness analysis of DCD kidney transplantation,"Expansion of the donor pool with expanded criteria donors and donation after cardiac death (DCD) donors is essential. DCD grafts result in increased rates of primary non-function (PNF) and delayed graft function (DGF). However, long-term patient and graft survival is similar between donation after brain death (DBD) donors and DCD donors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the use of DCD donors. A Markov-based decision analytic model was created to simulate outcomes for two wait list strategies: (i) wait list composed of only DBD organs and (ii) wait list combining DBD and DCD organs. Baseline values and ranges were determined from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) database and literature review. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to test model strength and parameter variability. The wait list strategy consisting of DBD donors only provided recipients 5.4 Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at $65 000/QALY, whereas a wait list strategy combining DBD + DCD donors provided recipients 6.0 QALYs at a cost of $56 000/QALY.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the long-term clinical outcomes and the cost effectiveness of therapeutic strategies using boceprevir with peginterferon plus ribavirin (PR) in comparison with PR alone for treating HCV genotype 1 infection in Portugal. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project the expected lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with PR alone and the treatment strategies outlined by the European Medicines Agency in the boceprevir summary of product characteristics. The boceprevir-based therapeutic strategies differ according to whether or not the patient was previously treated and whether or not the patient had compensated cirrhosis. The model simulated the experience of a series of cohorts of chronically HCV-infected patients (each defined by age, sex, race and fibrosis score). All treatment-related inputs were obtained from boceprevir clinical trials - SPRINT-2, RESPOND-2 and PROVIDE. Estimates of the natural history parameters and health state utilities were based on published studies. Portugal-specific annual direct costs of HCV health states were estimated by convening a panel of experts to derive health state resource use and multiplying the results by national unit costs. The model was developed from a healthcare system perspective with a timeframe corresponding to the remaining duration of the patients'' lifetimes. Both future costs and QALYs were discounted at 5 %. To test the robustness of the conclusions, we conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In comparison with the treatment with PR alone, boceprevir-based regimens were projected to reduce the lifetime incidence of advanced liver disease, liver transplantation, and liver-related death by 45-51 % and increase life expectancy by 2.3-4.3 years. Although the addition of BOC increased treatment costs by euro13,300-euro19,700, the reduction of disease burden resulted in a decrease of euro5,400-euro9,000 in discounted health state costs and an increase of 0.68-1.23 in discounted QALYs per patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the boceprevir-based regimens compared with PR among previously untreated and previously treated patients were euro11,600/QALY and euro8,700/QALY, respectively. The results were most sensitive to variations in sustained virologic response rates, discount rates and age at treatment.

Portugal-specific annual direct costs of HCV health states were estimated by convening a panel of experts to derive health state resource use and multiplying the results by national unit costs. The model was developed from a healthcare system perspective with a timeframe corresponding to the remaining duration of the patients'' lifetimes. Both future costs and QALYs were discounted at 5 %. To test the robustness of the conclusions, we conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In comparison with the treatment with PR alone, boceprevir-based regimens were projected to reduce the lifetime incidence of advanced liver disease, liver transplantation, and liver-related death by 45-51 % and increase life expectancy by 2.3-4.3 years. Although the addition of BOC increased treatment costs by euro13,300-euro19,700, the reduction of disease burden resulted in a decrease of euro5,400-euro9,000 in discounted health state costs and an increase of 0.68-1.23 in discounted QALYs per patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the boceprevir-based regimens compared with PR among previously untreated and previously treated patients were euro11,600/QALY and euro8,700/QALY, respectively. The results were most sensitive to variations in sustained virologic response rates, discount rates and age at treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Adding boceprevir to PR was projected to reduce the number of liver complications and liver-related deaths, and to be cost effective in treating both previously untreated and treated patients.",2013-01-10810,23355388,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Elamin H Elbasha,2013,11 / 1,65-78,Yes,23355388,"Elamin H Elbasha; Jagpreet Chhatwal; Shannon A Ferrante; Antoine C El Khoury; Pedro A Laires; Cost-effectiveness analysis of boceprevir for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1 infection in Portugal, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 11(1):1179-1896; 65-78",QALY,Portugal,Not Stated,Not Stated,BOC- Bocepevir and peginterferon- ribavarin regimen vs. Standard/Usual care- peginterferon- ribavarin regimen for 48 weeks,previously treated patients,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,8717,Euro,2010,13692.57
10970,Cost effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve replacement compared to medical management in inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis: Canadian analysis based on the PARTNER Trial Cohort B findings,"OBJECTIVE: The only effective treatment for severe aortic stenosis (AS) is valve replacement. However, many patients with co-existing conditions are ineligible for surgical valve replacement, historically leaving medical management (MM) as the only option which has a poor prognosis. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) is a less invasive replacement method. The objective was to estimate cost-effectiveness of TAVR via transfemoral access vs MM in surgically inoperable patients with severe AS from the Canadian public healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of TAVR vs MM was conducted using a deterministic decision analytic model over a 3-year time horizon. The PARTNER randomized controlled trial results were used to estimate survival, utilities, and some resource utilization. Costs included the valve replacement procedure, complications, hospitalization, outpatient visits/tests, and home/nursing care. Resources were valued (2009 Canadian dollars) using costs from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative (OCCI), Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and Ontario Drug Benefits Formulary, or were estimated using relative costs from a French economic evaluation or clinical experts. Costs and outcomes were discounted 5% annually. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters was explored in deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $32,170 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for TAVR vs MM. When the time horizon was shortened to 24 and 12 months, the ICER increased to $52,848 and $157,429, respectively. All other sensitivity analysis returned an ICER of less than $50,000/QALY gained. LIMITATIONS: A limitation was lack of availability of Canadian-specific resource and cost data for all resources, leaving one to rely on clinical experts and data from France to inform certain parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this analysis, it can be concluded that TAVR is cost-effective compared to MM for the treatment of severe AS in surgically inoperable patients.",2013-01-10811,23356420,J Med Econ,Rebecca L Hancock-Howard,2013,16 / 4,566-74,Yes,23356420,"Rebecca L Hancock-Howard; Christopher M Feindel; Josep Rodes-Cabau; John G Webb; Ann K Thompson; Kurt Banz; Cost effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve replacement compared to medical management in inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis: Canadian analysis based on the PARTNER Trial Cohort B findings, J Med Econ, ; 16(4):1369-6998; 566-74",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) vs. Medical management (MM),Ineligible for conventional surgery,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"3 Years, 12 and 24 months",5.00,5.00,32170,Canada,2009,34165.12

10974,Cost-effectiveness of single-dose tamsulosin and dutasteride combination therapy compared with tamsulosin monotherapy in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of single-dose dutasteride/tamsulosin combination therapy as a first-line treatment for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A Markov state transition model was developed to estimate healthcare costs and patient outcomes, measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), for patients aged >/=50 years with diagnosed BPH and moderate to severe symptoms. Costs and outcomes were estimated for two treatment comparators: oral, daily, single-dose combination therapy (dutasteride 0.5 mg + tamsulosin 0.4 mg), and oral daily tamsulosin (0.4 mg) over a period up to 25 years. The efficacy of comparators was taken from results of the Combination of Avodart and Tamsulosin (CombAT) trial. RESULTS: Cumulative discounted costs per patient were higher with combination therapy than with tamsulosin, but QALYs were also higher. After 25 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for combination therapy was pound12,219, well within the threshold range ( pound20,000- pound30,000 per QALY) typically applied in the NHS. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of combination therapy being cost-effective given the threshold range is between 78% and 88%.

10975,A test-based strategy is more cost effective than empiric dose escalation for patients with Crohn's disease who lose responsiveness to infliximab,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with Crohn''s disease who become unresponsive to therapy with tumor necrosis factor antagonists are managed initially with either empiric dose escalation or testing-based strategies. The comparative cost effectiveness of these 2 strategies is unknown. We investigated whether a testing-based strategy is more cost effective than an empiric dose-escalation strategy. METHODS: A decision analytic model that simulated 2 cohorts of patients with Crohn''s disease compared outcomes for the 2 strategies over a 1-year time period. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the empiric strategy was expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, compared with the testing-based strategy. We performed 1-way, probabilistic, and prespecified secondary analyses. RESULTS: The testing strategy yielded similar QALYs compared with the empiric strategy (0.801 vs 0.800, respectively) but was less expensive ($31,870 vs $37,266, respectively). In sensitivity analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the empiric strategy ranged from $500,000 to more than $5 million per QALY gained. Similar rates of remission (63% vs 66%) and response (28% vs 26%) were achieved through differential use of available interventions. The testing-based strategy resulted in a higher percentage of surgeries (48% vs 34%) and lower percentage use of high-dose biological therapy (41% vs 54%). CONCLUSIONS: A testing-based strategy is a cost-effective alternative to the current strategy of empiric dose escalation for managing patients with Crohn''s disease who have lost responsiveness to infliximab.

10976,Cost-effectiveness of universal serologic screening to prevent nontraumatic hip and vertebral fractures in patients with celiac disease,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with asymptomatic or poorly managed celiac disease can experience bone loss, placing them at risk for hip and vertebral fractures. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of universal serologic screening (USS) vs symptomatic at-risk screening (SAS) strategies for celiac disease because of the risk of nontraumatic hip and vertebral fractures if untreated or undiagnosed. METHODS: We developed a lifetime Markov model of the screening strategies, each with male or female cohorts of 1000 patients who were 12 years old when screening began. We screened serum samples for levels of immunoglobulin A, compared with tissue transglutaminase and total immunoglobulin A, and findings were confirmed by mucosal biopsy. Transition probabilities and quality of life estimates were obtained from the literature. We used generalizable cost estimates and Medicare reimbursement rates and ran deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: For men, the average lifetime costs were $8532 and $8472 for USS and SAS strategies, respectively, corresponding to average quality-adjusted life year gains of 25.511 and 25.515. Similarly for women, costs were $11,383 and $11,328 for USS and SAS strategies, respectively, corresponding to quality-adjusted life year gains of 25.74 and 25.75. Compared with the current standard of care (SAS), USS produced higher average lifetime costs and lower quality of life for each sex. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the model was robust to realistic changes in all the variables, making USS cost-ineffective on the basis of these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: USS and SAS are similar in lifetime costs and quality of life, although the current SAS strategy was overall more cost-effective in preventing bone loss and fractures among patients with undiagnosed or subclinical disease.

METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to simulate 21-day patient transitions in a 10-year time horizon. The clinical data were primarily obtained from the results of a pivotal phase III trial that assessed gefitinib maintenance treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC. The cost data were derived from the perspective of the Chinese health care system. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 3 times the per capita GDP of China. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of uncertainty regarding the results. The impact of the gefitinib patient assistance program (GPAP) was evaluated. RESULTS: After EGFR genotyping, gefitinib maintenance treatment for advanced NSCLC with EGFR mutations increased the life expectancy by 0.74 years and 0.46 QALYs compared with routine follow-up at an additional cost of $26,149.90 USD ($7,178.20 with the GPAP). The ICER for gefitinib maintenance was $57,066.40 and $15,664.80 per QALY gained (at a 3% discount rate) without and with the GPAP, respectively.

10982,"Prospective pilot evaluation of the effectiveness and cost-utility of a ""health first"" case management service for long-term Incapacity Benefit recipients","BACKGROUND: In line with the NICE guidance, an NHS-commissioned case management intervention was provided for individuals receiving Incapacity Benefit payments for >/=3 years in the North East of England. The intervention aimed to improve the health of the participants. METHODS: A total of 131 participants receiving the intervention were compared over 9 months with a (non-equivalent) comparison group of 229 receiving Incapacity Benefit payments and usual care. Health was measured using EQ-5D, EQ-VAS, SF-8, HADS and the Nordic Musculoskeletal questionnaire. Socio-demographic and health behaviour data were also collected. Fixed-effects linear models with correlated errors were used to compare health changes between groups over time. A preliminary cost-utility analysis was also conducted. RESULTS: The comparison group measures of health were stable over time. Starting from comparatively poor initial levels, case-management group generic (EQ5D, EQ-VAS) and mental health (HADS-A, HADS-D and SF8-MCS) measures improved within 6 months to similar levels found in the comparison group. Musculoskeletal (Nordic 2) and health behaviours did not improve. Tentative estimates of cost-utility suggest an intervention cost in the region of pound16 700- pound23 500 per QALY.

10983,From accuracy to patient outcome and cost-effectiveness evaluations of diagnostic tests and biomarkers: an exemplary modelling study,"BACKGROUND: Proper evaluation of new diagnostic tests is required to reduce overutilization and to limit potential negative health effects and costs related to testing. A decision analytic modelling approach may be worthwhile when a diagnostic randomized controlled trial is not feasible. We demonstrate this by assessing the cost-effectiveness of modified transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) compared with manual palpation for the detection of atherosclerosis in the ascending aorta. METHODS: Based on a previous diagnostic accuracy study, actual Dutch reimbursement data, and evidence from literature we developed a Markov decision analytic model. Cost-effectiveness of modified TEE was assessed for a life time horizon and a health care perspective. Prevalence rates of atherosclerosis were age-dependent and low as well as high rates were applied. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was applied. RESULTS: The model synthesized all available evidence on the risk of stroke in cardiac surgery patients. The modified TEE strategy consistently resulted in more adapted surgical procedures and, hence, a lower risk of stroke and a slightly higher number of life-years. With 10% prevalence of atherosclerosis the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro 4,651 and euro 481 per quality-adjusted life year in 55-year-old men and women, respectively. In all patients aged 65 years or older the modified TEE strategy was cost saving and resulted in additional health benefits. CONCLUSIONS: Decision analytic modelling to assess the cost-effectiveness of a new diagnostic test based on characteristics, costs and effects of the test itself and of the subsequent treatment options is both feasible and valuable.

10989,Retigabine as add-on treatment of refractory epilepsy--a cost-utility study in a Swedish setting,"OBJECTIVES: To calculate comparative incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per quality-adjusted life year, QALY) and net marginal benefits for retigabine as add-on treatment for patients with uncontrolled focal seizures as compared to add-on lacosamide treatment and no add-on treatment, respectively. MATERIALS & METHODS: Calculations were performed using a validated decision-tree model. The study population consisted of adult patients with focal-onset epilepsy in published randomized placebo-controlled add-on trials of retigabine or lacosamide. Healthcare utilization and QALY for each treatment alternative were calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using the specification of this model as a basis for Monte Carlo simulations. 2009 prices were used for all costs. RESULTS: Results were reported for a 2-year follow-up period. Retigabine add-on treatment was both more effective and less costly than lacosamide add-on treatment, and the cost per additional QALY for the retigabine no add-on (standard) therapy comparison was estimated at 2009euro 15,753. Using a willingness-to-pay threshold for a QALY of euro 50,000, the net marginal values were estimated at 2009euro 605,874 for retigabine vs lacosamide and 2009euro 2,114,203 for retigabine vs no add-on, per 1,000 patients. The probabilistic analyses showed that the likelihood that retigabine treatment is cost-effective is at least 70%. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated cost per additional QALY, for the retigabine vs no add-on treatment comparison, is well within the range of newly published estimates of willingness to pay for an additional QALY.

10991,Reducing older driver motor vehicle collisions via earlier cataract surgery,"Older adults who undergo cataract extraction have roughly half the rate of motor vehicle collision (MVC) involvement per mile driven compared to cataract patients who do not elect cataract surgery. Currently in the U.S., most insurers do not allow payment for cataract surgery based upon the findings of a vision exam unless accompanied by an individual''s complaint of visual difficulties that seriously interfere with driving or other daily activities and individuals themselves may be slow or reluctant to complain and seek relief. As a consequence, surgery tends to occur after significant vision problems have emerged. We hypothesize that a proactive policy encouraging cataract surgery earlier for a lesser level of complaint would significantly reduce MVCs among older drivers. We used a Monte Carlo model to simulate the MVC experience of the U.S. population from age 60 to 89 under alternative protocols for the timing of cataract surgery which we call ""Current Practice"" (CP) and ""Earlier Surgery"" (ES). Our base model finds, from a societal perspective with undiscounted 2010 dollars, that switching to ES from CP reduces by about 21% the average number of MVCs, fatalities, and MVC cost per person. The net effect on total cost - all MVC costs plus cataract surgery expenditures - is a reduction of about 16%. Quality Adjusted Life Years would increase by about 5%. From the perspective of payers for healthcare, the switch would increase cataract surgery expenditure for ages 65+ by about 8% and for ages 60-64 by about 47% but these expenditures are substantially offset after age 65 by reductions in the medical and emergency services component of MVC cost. Similar results occur with discounting at 3% and with various sensitivity analyses.

RESULTS: In the MALEO population, strontium ranelate compared with no treatment was estimated at <euro>49,798 and <euro>25,584 per QALY gained using efficacy data from the intent-to-treat analysis and the per-protocol analysis including only adherent patients, respectively. In men with a BMD T-score </=-2.5 or with PVF, the cost per QALY gained of strontium ranelate fall below thresholds of <euro>45,000 and <euro>25,000 per QALY gained based on efficacy data from the entire population of the clinical trial and from the per-protocol analyses, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that, under the assumption of same relative risk reduction of fractures in men as for women, strontium ranelate could be considered cost-effective compared with no treatment for male osteoporosis.",2013-01-10834,23371359,Osteoporos Int,M Hiligsmann,2013,24 / 8,2291-300,No,23371359,"M Hiligsmann; W Ben Sedrine; O Bruyere; J-Y Reginster; Cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate in the treatment of male osteoporosis, Osteoporos Int, ; 24(8):0937-941X; 2291-300",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Strontium ranelate vs. None,"bone mineral density (BMD) T-score of -2.2 - 28.1%, prevalent vertebral fracture",Not Stated,65 Years,Male,Full,"6 Months, 12 months",3.00,1.50,49798,Euro,2010,78222.17
10995,Cost-effectiveness of a novel e-health depression service,"OBJECTIVES: A recent trial assessed feasibility of an e-health service ("" Improvehealth.eu "") to support depression care and reported positive outcomes. Our objective was to examine cost-effectiveness of the Improvehealth.eu service. A baseline model was used to evaluate cost and effects of the intervention. Given the high uncertainty in the input space, a series of alternative scenarios were evaluated to challenge the result. The aim was to find if conservative or even pessimistic estimates and assumptions could result in a change of the cost-effectiveness from the baseline model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A probabilistic depression model combined with bootstrapping was built and populated with data from the literature and from the pilot efficacy trial of the e-health service. The core of the model was a stochastic mapping function that translated depression-specific outcomes to quality-adjusted life years. Correlated sampling was used to obtain unbiased and consistent piecewise linear transformation of Beck Depression Inventory scores to utilities. The results are shown as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with value of information data. An extreme scenario analysis was then performed to deal with parameter, structural, and modeling uncertainty. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness of the e-health service was favorable because of low cost and high efficacy of the intervention. Apart from the most pessimistic one, none of the 13 alternative scenarios changed the preferred alternative. CONCLUSIONS: Improvehealth.eu is cost-effective relative to usual care, given the available efficacy data. Results of the health economic evaluation were robust to alternative assumptions, despite considerable uncertainty in input data.",2013-01-10836,23374036,Telemed J E Health,Klemen Naversnik,2013,19 / 2,110-6,No,23374036,"Klemen Naversnik; Ales Mrhar; Cost-effectiveness of a novel e-health depression service, Telemed J E Health, ; 19(2):1530-5627; 110-6",QALY,Slovenia,Not Stated,Not Stated,'Improvehealth.eu' e-health service to support depression care and reported positive outcomes consisting of a web based information and communication technology system and online- and phone-based care management performed by trained psychologists vs. Standard/Usual care- physician visits and antidepressant treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,1400,Euro,2011,2241.58
10996,Topical therapies for the treatment of localized plaque psoriasis in primary care: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Topical therapies are a mainstay of psoriasis treatment, but they vary substantially in terms of cost. OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness and optimal treatment sequence for psoriasis of the trunk, limbs and scalp. METHODS: Probabilities of response from a network meta-analysis were used to determine the short-term efficacy of topical therapies. Longer-term outcomes, including relapse, were informed by published evidence and clinical opinion. Benefits of treatment were measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Direct costs included topical agents, primary and secondary care visits and second-line therapies for treatment failures. RESULTS: For the trunk and limbs, initial treatment with a two-compound formulation (TCF) product containing vitamin D and potent corticosteroid provided the most QALYs, followed by separate morning and evening application of vitamin D and potent corticosteroid [two-compound application, TCA (am/pm)], and then twice-daily potent corticosteroids. The use of twice-daily potent corticosteroids was the most cost-effective first-line strategy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio pound 20,000 per QALY), followed by TCA (am/pm) ( pound 22,658 per QALY) and TCF product ( pound 179,439 per QALY). For scalp psoriasis, initial treatment with very potent corticosteroids generated the most QALYs, followed by TCF product and then potent corticosteroids. Very potent corticosteroids were the most cost-effective treatment but, if too aggressive, potent corticosteroids were optimal followed by TCF product ( pound 219,846 per QALY). The cost-effectiveness of second- and third-line topical agents varied with the assumptions made.

10999,A cost-efficacy decision analysis of prophylactic clip placement after endoscopic removal of large polyps,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Delayed bleeding after lower endoscopy and polypectomy can cause significant morbidity. One strategy to reduce bleeding is to place an endoscopic clip on the polypectomy site. We used decision analysis to investigate the cost-effectiveness of routine clip placement after colon polypectomy. METHODS: Probabilities and plausible ranges were obtained from the literature, and a decision analysis was conducted by using TreeAge Pro 2011 Software. Our cost-effectiveness threshold was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year. The reference case was a 50-year-old patient who had a single 1.0- to 1.5-cm polyp removed during colonoscopy. We estimated postpolypectomy bleeding rates for patients receiving no medications, those with planned resumption of antiplatelet therapy (nonaspirin), or those receiving anticoagulation therapy after polypectomy. We performed several sensitivity analyses, varying the cost of a clip and hospitalization, number of clips placed, clip effectiveness in reducing postpolypectomy bleeding, reduction in patient utility days related to gastrointestinal bleeding, and probability of harm from clip placement. RESULTS: On the basis of the reference case, when patients did not receive anticoagulation therapy, clip placement was not cost-effective. However, for patients who did receive anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies, prophylactic clip placement was a cost-effective strategy. The cost-effectiveness of a prophylactic clip strategy was sensitive to the costs of clips and hospitalization, number of clips placed, and clip effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of a prophylactic endoscopic clip after polypectomy appears to be a cost-effective strategy for patients who receive antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy.

11000,"Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate, and pentoxifylline for the treatment of intermittent claudication in people with peripheral arterial disease","We assessed the cost-effectiveness of cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate, and pentoxifylline for intermittent claudication due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in adults whose symptoms continue despite a period of conventional management. A Markov decision model was developed to assess the lifetime costs and benefits of each vasoactive drug compared to no vasoactive drug and with each other. Regression analysis was undertaken to model the relationship between maximum walking distance and utility. Resource use data were sourced from the literature and sensitivity analyses were undertaken. Naftidrofuryl oxalate is more effective and less costly than cilostazol and pentoxifylline and has an estimated cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of around pound6070 compared to no vasoactive drug. The analysis uses effectiveness evidence from a network meta-analysis. In contrast to previous guidelines recommending cilostazol, the analysis suggests that naftidrofuryl oxalate is the only vasoactive drug for PAD which is likely to be cost-effective.",2013-01-10843,23378195,Angiology,Yang Meng,2014,65 / 3,,No,23378195,"Yang Meng; Hazel Squires; John W Stevens; Emma Simpson; Sue Harnan; Steve Thomas; Jonathan Michaels; Gerard Stansby; Mark E O'Donnell; Cost-effectiveness of cilostazol, naftidrofuryl oxalate, and pentoxifylline for the treatment of intermittent claudication in people with peripheral arterial disease, Angiology, 2014 Mar; 65(3):1940-1574",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pentoxifylline vs. No vasoactive drug,Not Stated,Not Stated,66 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,54777.78,United Kingdom,2010,100370.51
