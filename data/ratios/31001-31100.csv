31001,"Delayed diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in HIV+ patients in Mozambique: A cost-effectiveness analysis of screening protocols based on four symptom screening, smear microscopy, urine LAM test and Xpert MTB/RIF","BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) represents the ninth leading cause of death worldwide. In 2016 are estimated 1.3 million TB deaths among HIV negative people and an additional 374,000 deaths among HIV positive people. In 2016 are estimated 1.4 million new cases of TB in people living with HIV (PLHIV), 74% of whom were living in Africa. In light of these data, the reduction of mortality caused by TB in PLHIV is strongly required specially in low-income countries as Mozambique. According to international guidelines, the initial TB screening in HIV+ patients should be done with the four symptoms screening (4SS: fever, current cough, night sweats and weight loss). The diagnostic test more used in resource-limited countries is smear microscopy (SMEAR). World Health Organization (WHO) recommended Lateral Flow urine LipoArabinoMannan assay (LF-LAM) in immunocompromised patients; in 2010 WHO endorsed the use of Xpert Mycobacterium Tuberculosis/Rifampicin (MTB/RIF) test for rapid TB diagnosis but the assay is not used as screening test in all HIV+ patients irrespectively of symptoms due to cost and logistical barriers. The paper aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three screening protocols: standard (4SS and SMEAR in positive patients to 4SS); MTB/RIF; LF-LAM / MTB/RIF. METHODS: We developed a model to assess the cost-effectiveness of the MTB/RIF protocol versus the common standard and LF-LAM / MTB/RIF protocol. The model considered a sample of 1,000 HIV+ antiretroviral treatment naive patients in Mozambique. We evaluated disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for each protocol, cost per DALY, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), over 1-year, assuming a national healthcare system perspective. The model considered the delayed diagnosis as the time elapsed between a false negative test and the diagnosis and treatment of TB. Additional health system organization delay is defined as the time interval between positive test and treatment initiation caused by a delay in the delivery of results due organization of services. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on more relevant variables. RESULTS: The MTB/RIF protocol was cost-effective as compared to the standard protocol with an ICER of $56.54 per DALY saved. In a cohort of 1,000 patients MTB/RIF and LF-LAM / MTB/RIF protocol generated 1,281 and 1,254 DALY''s saved respectively, with a difference of 174 and 147 DALY respect to the standard protocol. The total cost of MTB/RIF protocol was lower ($92,263) than the standard ($147,226) and the LF-LAM / MTB/RIF ($113,196). Therefore, the cost per DALY saved including new infections due to delayed diagnosis with the standard protocol was $79.06, about 5 fold higher than MTB/RIF and LF-LAM / MTB/RIF protocols. The cost of additional TB infections due to delays in diagnosis plus health system delay seemed the more relevant costs. The low sensibility and sensitivity of the standard protocol led to a high number of false negatives, thus delayed TB diagnoses and treatment lead to the development of newly transmitted TB infections. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the MTB/RIF adoption could lead to an increasing of TB case-finding and a reduction in costs compared with standard and LF-LAM / MTB/RIF protocols.",2018-01-26716,30024890,PLoS One,S Orlando,2018,13 / 7,e0200523,No,30024890,"S Orlando; I Triulzi; F Ciccacci; I Palla; L Palombi; M C Marazzi; M Giuliano; M Floridia; S Mancinelli; E Mutemba; G Turchetti; Delayed diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in HIV+ patients in Mozambique: A cost-effectiveness analysis of screening protocols based on four symptom screening, smear microscopy, urine LAM test and Xpert MTB/RIF, PLoS One , 2018; 13(7):1932-6203; e0200523",DALY,Mozambique,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Screening",Xpert mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampicin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard protocol: 4SS and SMEAR for participants with positive 4SS results,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,-315.88,United States,2016,-340.63

31003,Reducing micronutrient deficiencies in Pakistani children: are subsidies on fortified complementary foods cost-effective?,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of price subsidies on fortified packaged complementary foods (FPCF) in reducing iodine deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia and vitamin A deficiency in Pakistani children. DESIGN: The study proceeded in three steps: (i) we determined the current lifetime costs of the three micronutrient deficiencies with a health economic model; (ii) we assessed the price sensitivity of demand for FPCF with a market survey in two Pakistani districts; (iii) we combined the findings of the first two steps with the results of a systematic review on the effectiveness of FPCF in reducing micronutrient deficiencies. The cost-effectiveness was estimated by comparing the net social cost of price subsidies with the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted. SETTING: Districts of Faisalabad and Hyderabad in Pakistan. SUBJECTS: Households with 6-23-month-old children stratified by socio-economic strata. RESULTS: The lifetime social costs of iodine deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia and vitamin A deficiency in 6-23-month-old children amounted to production losses of $US 209 million and 175 000 DALY. Poor households incurred the highest costs, yet even wealthier households suffered substantial losses. Wealthier households were more likely to buy FPCF. The net cost per DALY of the interventions ranged from a return per DALY averted of $US 783 to $US 65. Interventions targeted at poorer households were most cost-effective.

DESIGN: The study proceeded in three steps: (i) we determined the current lifetime costs of the three micronutrient deficiencies with a health economic model; (ii) we assessed the price sensitivity of demand for FPCF with a market survey in two Pakistani districts; (iii) we combined the findings of the first two steps with the results of a systematic review on the effectiveness of FPCF in reducing micronutrient deficiencies. The cost-effectiveness was estimated by comparing the net social cost of price subsidies with the disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted.

31019,Effects of geographic and economic heterogeneity on rotavirus diarrhea burden and vaccination impact and cost-effectiveness in the Lao People's Democratic Republic,"Rotavirus enteritis is responsible for nearly 200,000 child deaths worldwide in 2015. Globally, many low- and middle-income countries have introduced rotavirus vaccine, resulting in documented reductions in hospitalizations and child mortality. We examined the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing rotavirus vaccination in Lao People''s Democratic Republic using an Excel-based spreadsheet model. We estimated mortality risk factors, patterns of care seeking, and vaccination access to predict outcomes for regional, provincial, and socioeconomic subpopulations for one birth cohort through their first five years of life and life course in Disability-Adjusted Life Years estimates. Socioeconomic status was defined by categorizing households into regional wealth quintiles based on a national asset index. We modeled a two-dose ROTARIX vaccine under current Gavi pricing and efficacy estimates from Bangladesh and Vietnam. DPT1 and DPT2 coverages were used to estimate rotavirus vaccination coverage. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess the impact of uncertainty on model parameters on predicted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), including scenarios of increases in vaccination coverage. Rotavirus vaccination would prevent 143 child deaths/year, or 28% of annual rotavirus burden. The estimated national level ICER for rotavirus vaccination was $140/DALY, with regional socioeconomic subpopulation estimates ranging from $72/DALY for the poorest in the Central region to $353/DALY for the richest in the North region, indicating high cost-effectiveness. Within regions, ICERs are most favorable for children in the poorer and poorest quintiles. However, the full benefits of rotavirus vaccination will only be realized by reducing disparities in vaccination coverage, access to treatment, and environmental health. Improving vaccination coverage to equitable levels alone would prevent 87 additional child deaths per year.",2018-99-26762,30007827,Vaccine,Richard Rheingans,2018,/,,Yes,30007827,"Richard Rheingans; John D 4th Anderson; Karoun H Bagamian; Clinton J Pecenka; Effects of geographic and economic heterogeneity on rotavirus diarrhea burden and vaccination impact and cost-effectiveness in the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Vaccine, 2018 Jan 31; ():1873-2518",DALY,Lao,Not Stated,Immunization,"Rotavirus vaccination, national vs. None",Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,140,United States,2017,147.82
31020,Effects of geographic and economic heterogeneity on the burden of rotavirus diarrhea and the impact and cost-effectiveness of vaccination in Pakistan,"Globally, rotavirus is a leading cause of childhood diarrhea and related mortality. Although rotavirus vaccination has been introduced in many countries worldwide, there are numerous low- to middle-income countries that have not yet introduced. Pakistan is one of the countries with the highest number of rotavirus deaths in children under five years. Although rotavirus infection is almost universal among children, mortality is often a result of poor nutrition and lack of access to health care and other aspects of poverty. We assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing childhood rotavirus vaccination in Pakistan. We use household data from the 2012-2013 Demographic Health survey in Pakistan to estimate heterogeneity in rotavirus mortality risk, vaccination benefits, and cost-effectiveness across geographic and economic groups. We estimate two-dose rotavirus vaccination coverage that would be distributed through a routine vaccination program. In addition, we estimate rotavirus mortality (burden), and other measures of vaccine cost-effectiveness and impact by subpopulations of children aggregated by region and economic status. Results indicate that the highest estimated regional rotavirus burden is in Sindh (3.3 rotavirus deaths/1000 births) and Balochistan (3.1 rotavirus deaths/1000 births), which also have the lowest estimated vaccination coverage, particularly for children living in the poorest households. In Pakistan, introduction could prevent 3061 deaths per year with current routine immunization patterns at an estimated $279/DALY averted. Increases in coverage to match the region with highest coverage (Islamabad) could prevent an additional 1648 deaths per year. Vaccination of children in the highest risk regions could result in a fourfold mortality reduction as compared to low risk children, and children in the poorest households have a three to four times greater mortality reduction benefit than the richest.

We estimate two-dose rotavirus vaccination coverage that would be distributed through a routine vaccination program. In addition, we estimate rotavirus mortality (burden), and other measures of vaccine cost-effectiveness and impact by subpopulations of children aggregated by region and economic status. Results indicate that the highest estimated regional rotavirus burden is in Sindh (3.3 rotavirus deaths/1000 births) and Balochistan (3.1 rotavirus deaths/1000 births), which also have the lowest estimated vaccination coverage, particularly for children living in the poorest households. In Pakistan, introduction could prevent 3061 deaths per year with current routine immunization patterns at an estimated $279/DALY averted. Increases in coverage to match the region with highest coverage (Islamabad) could prevent an additional 1648 deaths per year. Vaccination of children in the highest risk regions could result in a fourfold mortality reduction as compared to low risk children, and children in the poorest households have a three to four times greater mortality reduction benefit than the richest.

31026,Impact of adverse drug reactions on the incremental cost-effectiveness of bedaquiline for drug-resistant tuberculosis,"BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common during standard, long-course treatment for multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-/RR-TB). In particular, second-line injectables (SLIs) are associated with permanent hearing loss, acute renal injury and electrolyte imbalance. We adapted an established Markov model for ambulatory treatment to estimate the impact of the toxicity profile on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for a proposed MDR-/RR-TB regimen replacing the SLI with bedaquiline (BDQ). METHODS: Treatment effectiveness was evaluated in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Clinical outcomes and ingredient costs from a provider perspective were derived from the South African public-sector treatment program or extracted from the literature. Costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3% per year over 10 years. RESULTS: A BDQ-based MDR-/RR-TB regimen compared with the SLI regimen had a mean ICER of US$516 per DALY averted using the standard Markov model. Costs for both regimens increased and effectiveness decreased for the SLI regimen once adjusted for toxicity. The resulting ICER for the BDQ-based regimen was cost saving (US$96/patient) and more effective (0.96 DALYs averted) after adjusting for ADRs. CONCLUSION: Decision-analysis models of treatment for MDR-/RR-TB, including new drug regimens, should consider the costs of managing ADRs and their sequelae.",2018-01-26801,29991402,Int J Tuberc Lung Dis,K Schnippel,2018,22 / 8,918-925,No,29991402,"K Schnippel; C Firnhaber; L Page-Shipp; E Sinanovic; Impact of adverse drug reactions on the incremental cost-effectiveness of bedaquiline for drug-resistant tuberculosis, Int J Tuberc Lung Dis, 2018 Aug 1; 22(8):1027-3719; 918-925",DALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Bedaquiline-based multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis regimen vs. Second-line injectables regimen,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,516,United States,2016,556.43
31027,"Cost effectiveness of mHealth intervention by community health workers for reducing maternal and newborn mortality in rural Uttar Pradesh, India","Background: A variety of mobile-based health technologies (mHealth) have been developed for use by community health workers to augment their performance. One such mHealth intervention-ReMiND program, was implemented in a poor performing district of India. Despite some research on the extent of its effectiveness, there is significant dearth of evidence on cost-effectiveness of such mHealth interventions. In this paper we evaluated the incremental cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted as a result of ReMiND intervention as compared to routine maternal and child health programs without ReMiND. Methods: A decision tree was parameterized on MS-Excel spreadsheet to estimate the change in DALYs and cost as a result of implementing ReMiND intervention compared with routine care, from both health system and societal perspective. A time horizon of 10 years starting from base year of 2011 was considered appropriate to cover all costs and effects comprehensively. All costs, including those during start-up and implementation phase, besides other costs on the health system or households were estimated. Consequences were measured as part of an impact assessment study which used a quasi-experimental design. Proximal outputs in terms of changes in service coverage were modelled to estimate maternal and infant illnesses and deaths averted, and DALYs averted in Uttar Pradesh state of India. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to account for parameter uncertainties. Results: Cumulatively, from year 2011 to 2020, implementation of ReMiND intervention in UP would result in a reduction of 312 maternal and 149,468 neonatal deaths. This implies that ReMiND program led to a reduction of 0.2% maternal and 5.3% neonatal deaths. Overall, ReMiND is a cost saving intervention from societal perspective. From health system perspective, ReMiND incurs an incremental cost of INR 12,993 (USD 205) per DALY averted and INR 371,577 (USD 5865) per death averted. Conclusions: Overall, findings of our study suggest strongly that the mHealth intervention as part of ReMiND program is cost saving from a societal perspective and should be considered for replication elsewhere in other states.",2018-99-26815,29983645,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Shankar Prinja,2018,16 /,25,Yes,29983645,"Shankar Prinja; Pankaj Bahuguna; Aditi Gupta; Ruby Nimesh; Madhu Gupta; Jarnail Singh Thakur; Cost effectiveness of mHealth intervention by community health workers for reducing maternal and newborn mortality in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2018; 16():1478-7547; 25",DALY,India,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care",Routine health services and m-health vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,-102.92,United States,2015,-112.38
31028,47-Fold rise of diabetes in childbearing age Chilean women: Markov model and cost-effectiveness of prevention of birth defects,"AIM: Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) during childbearing age in Chile had a 47-fold rise in 7 years, reaching 120 844 women, half of which are unaware of their condition. We aimed to project pregnancies and births among Chilean women of childbearing age (WCBA) with T2DM and report the incidence of birth defects and the associated years of life lost and lifetime costs. METHODS: Markov model of cohort of WCBA with T2DM (WCBA-DM) with a 20-year time horizon (2018-2037), using data from previous studies. Two scenarios were assessed: scenario A: no universal detection of T2DM and scenario B: universal screening of T2DM using glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Both lifetime costs and disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were calculated with a 5% discount rate (US$ of 2017). RESULTS: In scenario A, 12 163 infants with birth defects could be born among the analyzed cohort, resulting in 243 260 years of life lost, 296 652 DALY and in lifetime costs of US$ 1 957 657 966. In scenario B, the first three figures could be reduced by 70.4% to 3599 infants with birth defects, 71 980 years of life lost and 87 794 DALY. Due to the addition of diabetes screening and new patient costs to scenario B, there would be a lesser reduction (67.3%) in total lifetime costs, to US$ 640 669 296. CONCLUSION: Screening of diabetes in WCBA would yield a 20-year reduction of 70.4% in the number of infants with birth defects, years of life lost and DALY.

31033,Cost-effectiveness of a potential Zika vaccine candidate: a case study for Colombia,"BACKGROUND: A number of Zika vaccine platforms are currently being investigated, some of which have entered clinical trials. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a potential Zika vaccine candidate under the WHO Vaccine Target Product Profile for outbreak response, prioritizing women of reproductive age to prevent microcephaly and other neurological disorders. METHODS: Using an agent-based simulation model of ZIKV transmission dynamics in a Colombian population setting, we conducted cost-effectiveness analysis with and without pre-existing herd immunity. The model was parameterized with estimates associated with ZIKV infection, risks of microcephaly in different trimesters, direct medical costs, and vaccination costs. We assumed that a single dose of vaccine provides a protection efficacy in the range 60% to 90% against infection. Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted from a government perspective. RESULTS: Under a favorable scenario when the reproduction number is relatively low (R0 = 2.2) and the relative transmissibility of asymptomatic infection is 10% compared with symptomatic infection, a vaccine is cost-saving (with negative incremental cost-effective ratio; ICER) for vaccination costs up to US$6 per individual without herd immunity, and up to US$4 per individual with 8% herd immunity. For positive ICER values, vaccination is highly cost-effective for vaccination costs up to US$10 (US$7) in the respective scenarios with the willingness-to-pay of US$6610 per disability-adjusted life-year, corresponding to the average per capita GDP of Colombia between 2013 and 2017. Our results indicate that the effect of other control measures targeted to reduce ZIKV transmission decreases the range of vaccination costs for cost-effectiveness due to reduced returns of vaccine-induced herd immunity. In all scenarios investigated, the median reduction of microcephaly exceeded 64% with vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a Zika vaccine with protection efficacy as low as 60% could significantly reduce the incidence of microcephaly. From a government perspective, Zika vaccination is highly cost-effective, and even cost-saving in Colombia if vaccination costs per individual is sufficiently low. Efficacy data from clinical trials and number of vaccine doses will be important requirements in future studies to refine our estimates, and conduct similar studies in other at-risk populations.",2018-01-26847,29966516,BMC Med,Affan Shoukat,2018,16 / 1,100,No,29966516,"Affan Shoukat; Thomas Vilches; Seyed M Moghadas; Cost-effectiveness of a potential Zika vaccine candidate: a case study for Colombia, BMC Med, 2018 Jan 30; 16(1):1741-7015; 100",DALY,Colombia,Not Stated,Immunization,Zika vaccine vs. None,0% herd immunity,64 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2017,Not Stated
31034,"The cost of preventing undernutrition: cost, cost-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of three cash-based interventions on nutrition outcomes in Dadu, Pakistan","Cash-based interventions (CBIs) increasingly are being used to deliver humanitarian assistance and there is growing interest in the cost-effectiveness of cash transfers for preventing undernutrition in emergency contexts. The objectives of this study were to assess the costs, cost-efficiency and cost-effectiveness in achieving nutrition outcomes of three CBIs in southern Pakistan: a ''double cash'' (DC) transfer, a ''standard cash'' (SC) transfer and a ''fresh food voucher'' (FFV) transfer. Cash and FFVs were provided to poor households with children aged 6-48 months for 6 months in 2015. The SC and FFV interventions provided $14 monthly and the DC provided $28 monthly. Cost data were collected via institutional accounting records, interviews, programme observation, document review and household survey. Cost-effectiveness was assessed as cost per case of wasting, stunting and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Beneficiary costs were higher for the cash groups than the voucher group. Net total cost transfer ratios (TCTRs) were estimated as 1.82 for DC, 2.82 for SC and 2.73 for FFV. Yet, despite the higher operational costs, the FFV TCTR was lower than the SC TCTR when incorporating the participation cost to households, demonstrating the relevance of including beneficiary costs in cost-efficiency estimations. The DC intervention achieved a reduction in wasting, at $4865 per case averted; neither the SC nor the FFV interventions reduced wasting.

Our objective was to evaluate the long-term health and economic impacts of routine one-dose HPV vaccination compared to (1) no vaccination and (2) two-dose HPV vaccination in a low-income country. METHODS: We used a three-tiered hybrid modeling approach that captured HPV transmission, cervical carcinogenesis, and population demographics to project long-term health and economic outcomes associated with one-dose HPV vaccination (assuming 80% efficacy against HPV-16/18 infections under three waning scenarios) and two-dose HPV vaccination (assuming 100% efficacy over the lifetime) in Uganda. Costs included the vaccine program (dosage and delivery) costs over a 10-year period and cervical cancer costs over the lifetimes of the current population of Ugandan women. Health outcomes included number of cervical cancer cases and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., cost per DALY averted) were calculated and compared against the Ugandan per-capita gross domestic product. RESULTS: Routine one-dose HPV vaccination of 9-year-old girls required substantial upfront investment but was cost-saving compared to no vaccination when accounting for the cost-offsets from future cancers averted. Forty years after initiating routine vaccination and depending on assumptions of vaccine waning, one-dose HPV vaccination with equivalent coverage (70%) averted 15-16% of cervical cancer cases versus 21% with two-dose vaccination but required only half the upfront economic investment. Vaccination with two doses had an attractive cost-effectiveness profile except if one-dose vaccination enabled higher coverage (90% vs. 70%) and did not wane.

CONCLUSIONS: One-dose HPV vaccination resulted in cost-savings compared to no vaccination and could be cost-effective compared to two-dose vaccination if protection is longstanding and higher coverage can be achieved.",2018-99-27097,29807710,Vaccine,Emily A Burger,2018,36 / 32 Pt A,4823-4829,Yes,29807710,"Emily A Burger; Nicole G Campos; Stephen Sy; Catherine Regan; Jane J Kim; Health and economic benefits of single-dose HPV vaccination in a Gavi-eligible country, Vaccine, 2018 Aug 6; 36(32 Pt A):1873-2518; 4823-4829",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,Immunization,"Two-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, no wane in vaccine efficacy vs. One-dose human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, wane in vaccine efficacy after 10 years",Not Stated,9 Years,9 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,-0.32,International,2011,-0.37
31046,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Pediatric Operating Room in Uganda,"This study examines the cost-effectiveness of constructing a dedicated pediatric operating room (OR) in Uganda, a country where access to surgical care is limited to 4 pediatric surgeons serving a population of over 20 million children under 15 years of age. METHODS: A simulation model using a decision tree template was developed to project the cost and disability-adjusted life-years saved by a pediatric OR in a low-income setting. Parameters are informed by patient outcomes of the surgical procedures performed. Costs of the OR equipment and a literature review were used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a pediatric OR. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. Economic monetary benefit was calculated using the value of a statistical life approach. RESULTS: A pediatric OR averted a total of 6,447 disability-adjusted life-years /year (95% uncertainty interval 6,288-6,606) and cost $41,182/year (UI 40,539-41,825) in terms of OR installation. The pediatric operating room had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6.39 per disability-adjusted life-year averted (95% uncertainty interval of 6.19-6.59), or $397.95 (95% uncertainty interval of 385.41-410.67) per life saved based on the country''s average life expectancy in 2015. These values were well within the WHO guidelines of cost-effectiveness threshold. The net economic benefit amounted to $5,336,920 for a year of operation, or $16,371 per patient. The model remained robust with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: The construction of a pediatric operating room in Uganda is a cost-effective and worthwhile investment, endorsing future decisions to enhance pediatric surgical capacity in the resource-limited settings of Sub-Saharan Africa.",2018-99-27111,29801729,Surgery,Ava Yap,2018,/,,No,29801729,"Ava Yap; Arlene Muzira; Maija Cheung; James Healy; Nasser Kakembo; Phyllis Kisa; David Cunningham; George Youngson; John Sekabira; Reza Yaesoubi; Doruk Ozgediz; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a Pediatric Operating Room in Uganda, Surgery, 2018 Jul 25; ():0039-6060",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,Other,Dedicated pediatric operating room in Uganda vs. Standard/Usual Care- No pediatric operating room; patients receive standard nonsurgical treatment,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,5.50,Not Stated,6.39,United States,2015,6.98
31047,Cost-effectiveness of the controlled temperature chain for the hepatitis B virus birth dose vaccine in various global settings: a modelling study,"BACKGROUND: The controlled temperature chain (CTC) strategy allows vaccines to be kept outside the cold chain for a short period of time. In remote rural areas, the CTC strategy for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) birth dose vaccination could improve its geographical coverage and timeliness of delivery, but with additional outreach costs. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the CTC strategy for the HBV birth dose across six world regions and 72 countries according to their HBV prevalence, delivery costs, and birth dose coverage and timing. METHODS: By use of a mathematical model of perinatal HBV transmission and disease progression, we calculated per 1000 births the total HBV-related disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and costs, including vaccine delivery costs and costs associated with HBV-related disease, with and without the CTC strategy. FINDINGS: A CTC strategy produced health benefits in all regions and was cost-saving in the regions of east Asia and Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and north Africa and Middle East. The CTC strategy cost US$0.15 (IQR -7.11 to 4.75) per DALY averted in the central and eastern Europe and central Asia region and $79.72 (66.47 to 94.47) in the south Asia region. Within individual countries, more savings were achieved and more DALYs averted in areas with above average HBV prevalence, below average birth dose coverage, or later than average birth dose delivery.

Within individual countries, more savings were achieved and more DALYs averted in areas with above average HBV prevalence, below average birth dose coverage, or later than average birth dose delivery. INTERPRETATION: A CTC outreach strategy that improves the timing and coverage of the HBV birth dose vaccination is likely to be cost-saving and reduce the burden of HBV infection associated with perinatal transmission.

In remote rural areas, the CTC strategy for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) birth dose vaccination could improve its geographical coverage and timeliness of delivery, but with additional outreach costs. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the CTC strategy for the HBV birth dose across six world regions and 72 countries according to their HBV prevalence, delivery costs, and birth dose coverage and timing. METHODS: By use of a mathematical model of perinatal HBV transmission and disease progression, we calculated per 1000 births the total HBV-related disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and costs, including vaccine delivery costs and costs associated with HBV-related disease, with and without the CTC strategy. FINDINGS: A CTC strategy produced health benefits in all regions and was cost-saving in the regions of east Asia and Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and north Africa and Middle East. The CTC strategy cost US$0.15 (IQR -7.11 to 4.75) per DALY averted in the central and eastern Europe and central Asia region and $79.72 (66.47 to 94.47) in the south Asia region.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the CTC strategy for the HBV birth dose across six world regions and 72 countries according to their HBV prevalence, delivery costs, and birth dose coverage and timing. METHODS: By use of a mathematical model of perinatal HBV transmission and disease progression, we calculated per 1000 births the total HBV-related disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and costs, including vaccine delivery costs and costs associated with HBV-related disease, with and without the CTC strategy. FINDINGS: A CTC strategy produced health benefits in all regions and was cost-saving in the regions of east Asia and Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and north Africa and Middle East. The CTC strategy cost US$0.15 (IQR -7.11 to 4.75) per DALY averted in the central and eastern Europe and central Asia region and $79.72 (66.47 to 94.47) in the south Asia region. Within individual countries, more savings were achieved and more DALYs averted in areas with above average HBV prevalence, below average birth dose coverage, or later than average birth dose delivery. INTERPRETATION: A CTC outreach strategy that improves the timing and coverage of the HBV birth dose vaccination is likely to be cost-saving and reduce the burden of HBV infection associated with perinatal transmission.

In remote rural areas, the CTC strategy for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) birth dose vaccination could improve its geographical coverage and timeliness of delivery, but with additional outreach costs. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the CTC strategy for the HBV birth dose across six world regions and 72 countries according to their HBV prevalence, delivery costs, and birth dose coverage and timing. METHODS: By use of a mathematical model of perinatal HBV transmission and disease progression, we calculated per 1000 births the total HBV-related disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) and costs, including vaccine delivery costs and costs associated with HBV-related disease, with and without the CTC strategy. FINDINGS: A CTC strategy produced health benefits in all regions and was cost-saving in the regions of east Asia and Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, sub-Saharan Africa, and north Africa and Middle East. The CTC strategy cost US$0.15 (IQR -7.11 to 4.75) per DALY averted in the central and eastern Europe and central Asia region and $79.72 (66.47 to 94.47) in the south Asia region.
