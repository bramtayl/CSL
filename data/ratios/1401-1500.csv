1401,Cost-effectiveness of combined outreach for the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines,"BACKGROUND: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis as part of a randomized, controlled trial of a community-based outreach initiative to promote the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines for people aged 65 years or older. METHODS: The analysis was based on primary data from the trial on the increase in vaccination rates and cost of the intervention, and published estimates of the effectiveness of the vaccines and cost of treatment. We performed partial stochastic analyses based on the confidence intervals (CIs) of the effectiveness of the intervention and of the vaccines. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratio of the combined-outreach initiative as implemented was $35 486 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), whereas it was $53 547 per QALY for the pneumococcal vaccine and $130 908 per QALY for the influenza vaccine. In partial stochastic analyses, the quasi-CI of the combined-outreach initiative ranged from $15 145 to $152 311 per QALY. The cost-effectiveness ratio of the intervention targeted to people who had never received the pneumococcal vaccine or who had not received the influenza vaccine in the previous year was $11 771 per QALY, with a quasi-CI of $3330 to $46 095 per QALY. With the use of the projected cost of replicating the intervention, the cost-effectiveness ratio was $26 512 per QALY for the initiative as implemented and $7843 per QALY for a targeted initiative. CONCLUSIONS: The community-based outreach initiative to promote the pneumococcal and influenza vaccines was reasonably cost-effective.

1404,Cost-effectiveness of a school-based tobacco-use prevention program,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of a school-based tobacco-use prevention program. DESIGN: Using data from the previously reported 2-year efficacy study of the Project Toward No Tobacco Use (TNT), we conducted a decision analysis to determine the cost-effectiveness of TNT. The benefits measured were life years (LYs) saved, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, and medical care costs saved, discounted at 3%. The costs measured were program costs. We quantified TNT's cost-effectiveness as cost per LY saved and cost per QALY saved. INTERVENTION: A 10-lesson curriculum designed to counteract social influences and misconceptions that lead to tobacco use was delivered by trained health educators to a cohort of 1234 seventh-grade students in 8 junior high schools. A 2-lesson booster session was delivered to the eighth-grade students in the second year. The efficacy evaluation was based on 770 ninth-grade students who participated in the program in the seventh and eighth grades and in both the baseline and the 2-year follow-up survey. RESULTS: Under base case assumptions, at an intervention cost of $16 403, TNT prevented an estimated 34.9 students from becoming established smokers. As a result, we could expect a saving of $13 316 per LY saved and a saving of $8482 per QALY saved. Results showed TNT to be cost saving over a reasonable range of model parameter estimates.

1406,Cost-utility of enoxaparin compared with unfractionated heparin in unstable coronary artery disease,"BACKGROUND: Low molecular weight heparins hold several advantages over unfractionated heparin including convenience of administration. Enoxaparin is one such heparin licensed in the UK for use in unstable coronary artery disease (unstable stable angina and non-Q wave myocardial infarction). In these patients, two large randomised controlled trials and their meta-analysis showed small benefits for enoxaparin over unfractionated heparin at 30-43 days and potentially at one year.We found no relevant published full economic evaluations, only cost studies, one of which was conducted in the UK. The other studies, from the US, Canada and France, are difficult to interpret since their resource use and costs may not reflect UK practice. METHODS: We aimed to compare the benefits and costs of short-term treatment (two to eight days) with enoxaparin and unfractionated heparin in unstable coronary artery disease. We used published data sources to estimate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY), adopting a NHS perspective and using 1998 prices. RESULTS: The base case was a 0.013 QALY gain and net cost saving of 317 pounds sterling per person treated with enoxaparin instead of unfractionated heparin. All but one sensitivity analysis showed net savings and QALY gains, the exception (the worst case) being a cost per QALY of 3,305 pounds sterling. Best cases were a 495 pounds sterling saving and 0.013 QALY gain, or a 317 pounds sterling saving and 0.014 QALY gain per person. CONCLUSIONS: Enoxaparin appears cost saving compared with unfractionated heparin in patients with unstable coronary artery disease. However, cost implications depend on local revascularisation practice.",2001-01-02184,11701090,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,T Nicholson,2001,1 /,2,No,11701090,"T Nicholson; A McGuire; R Milne; Cost-utility of enoxaparin compared with unfractionated heparin in unstable coronary artery disease, BMC Cardiovasc Disord, 2001; 1():1471-2261; 2",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Short-term treatment (2 to 8 days) with Enoxaparin vs. Unfractionated heparin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-178230.77,United Kingdom,1998,-469019.83
1407,Cost-utility analysis of open versus laparoscopic groin hernia repair: results from a multicentre randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: This study was a pragmatic economic evaluation carried out alongside a multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing laparoscopic with open groin hernia repair. The primary economic evaluation framework employed was a cost-utility analysis. METHODS: At 26 hospitals in the UK and Ireland, 928 patients with a groin hernia were assigned randomly to laparoscopic or open repair. Cost data were identified and measured both within and outwith the trial. Cost data were combined with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from the EQ-5D questionnaire to obtain cost-per-QALY ratios. RESULTS: The mean cost of laparoscopic hernia repair was pound1112.64, compared with pound788.79 for the open operation. The extra cost of pound323.85 in the laparoscopic group was mainly due to additional theatre time and increased equipment and sterilization costs. The estimated incremental cost per QALY of the laparoscopic over the open method was pound55 548.00 (95 per cent confidence interval pound47 216.00- pound63 885.00).

1409,The cost-effectiveness of exclusion arteriography in extremity trauma,"The purpose of this study was to apply decision analysis to an established practice in vascular trauma diagnosis. While exclusion arteriography has resulted in an increase in positive surgical explorations, no formal analysis that determined either the cost-effectiveness of exclusion arteriography or the cost-effectiveness ratio has been reported in the literature. We created a decision model that compared exclusion arteriography and surgical exploration, the standard used prior to the development of extremity arteriography. The decision model used predominantly literature derived estimates for the prevalence of arterial injuries and the accuracy, complications, outcomes and costs of both arteriography and exploration. Exclusion arteriography is cost-effective. This finding is robust to changes in the major model variables. Compared to surgical exploration, exclusion arteriography is a superior strategy by dominance (more effective and costs less). Therefore, a cost-effectiveness ratio cannot be calculated. Under the base case assumption of 28% prevalence of arterial injury requiring operation, exclusion arteriography saves about $2000 and adds 0.3 quality adjusted life years (QALY) for each patient. Decision analysis can be successfully applied to problems in vascular trauma diagnosis.",2001-01-02186,11489646,Cardiovasc Surg,J D Keen,2001,9 / 5,441-7,No,11489646,"J D Keen; R R Keen; The cost-effectiveness of exclusion arteriography in extremity trauma, Cardiovasc Surg, 2001-Oct; 9(5):0967-2109; 441-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exclusion arteriography vs. Surgical exploration,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-6666.67,United States,1990,-13201.28
1410,Preevaluation of clinical trial data: the case of preemptive cytomegalovirus therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus,"We developed a mathematical simulation model to anticipate outcomes from an upcoming trial of targeted, preemptive cytomegalovirus (CMV) therapy in high-risk, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients identified by means of CMV polymerase chain reaction screening. We estimated the costs and consequences of CMV prophylaxis in patients with CD4(+) counts < or =100 cells/microL under various assumptions regarding disease progression, complication rates, drug effects, and costs. Without CMV preemptive therapy, lifetime costs average $44,600 with expected duration of survival of 19.16 quality-adjusted life-months and 213 CMV cases per 1000 patients. Targeted preemptive therapy with orally administered valganciclovir increases costs and duration of survival to $46,900 and 19.63 quality-adjusted life-months, respectively. CMV cases decrease to 174 per 1000 patients. The cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained is $59,000.

1412,The cost-effectiveness of early vitrectomy for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage in diabetic retinopathy,"Diabetic vitrectomy has been found to be efficacious for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage secondary to diabetic retinopathy. The purpose of this study is to determine the cost-effectiveness of early vitrectomy for the management of vitreous hemorrhage secondary to diabetic retinopathy. The analysis was performed from the perspective of a third-party insurer. A cost-utility Markov model was used to determine the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from early versus deferral of vitrectomy. The model used 2-, 3-, and 4-year results from the Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study, patient-based utilities, life expectancy data, and incremental medical costs. Early vitrectomy was the dominant strategy and was associated with a gain of 0.41 QALYs over the 57-year expected life span for a hypothetical patient. The cost per additional QALY gained from early vitrectomy treatment was $1910 (US$ discounted at 3%). When sensitivity analyses were performed by varying efficacy probabilities and utilities across their 95% confidence intervals, early treatment was always the dominant strategy. Additionally, even at the extreme sensitivity values, the cost per QALY of early vitrectomy treatment remained under $10,000. Overall, early vitrectomy for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage secondary to diabetic retinopathy is highly cost-effective.",2001-01-02188,11389353,Curr Opin Ophthalmol,S Sharma,2001,12 / 3,230-4,No,11389353,"S Sharma; H Hollands; G C Brown; M M Brown; G K Shah; S M Sharma; The cost-effectiveness of early vitrectomy for the treatment of vitreous hemorrhage in diabetic retinopathy, Curr Opin Ophthalmol, 2001-Jun; 12(3):1040-8738; 230-4",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early diabetic vitrectomy vs. Deferred vitrectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1910,United States,2000,2870.67
1413,A computer simulation model for cost-effectiveness analysis of mass screening for Type 2 diabetes mellitus,"The cost-effectiveness analysis of mass screening for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) was performed to elucidate whether, who and how often it should be conducted in Taiwan. A series of Markov process was developed to model the disease natural history of Type 2 DM. A hypothetical cohort with 30,000 residents aged over 30 years in Taiwan was randomly assigned to three arms of screening regimes, biennial, five-yearly and the control group. A Monte Carlo computer simulation was performed to calculate effectiveness of two screening regimes compared with the control group. Direct costs and utilities were incorporated to each corresponding state to calculate the incremental costs per life-years gained and per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for biennial and five-yearly screening regimes. The incremental costs for biennial screening regime were estimated at $26,750 per life-year gained, and $17,833 per QALY. The corresponding figures for five-yearly screening regime were $10,531 per life-year gained and $17,113 per QALY. The incremental costs per life-year gained and per QALY increase with age, ranging from $17,238 for aged 30-39 years to $54,700 for aged over 70 years and from $9193 to 36,467, respectively.

1432,A UK trial-based cost--utility analysis of transmyocardial laser revascularization compared to continued medical therapy for treatment of refractory angina pectoris,"OBJECTIVE: Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMLR) is used to treat patients with refractory angina considered unsuitable for conventional forms of revascularization. Using patient specific data from a single centre UK randomised-controlled trial, we aimed to determine whether, from a UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective, TMLR plus standard medical management is cost-effective when compared with standard medical management alone. METHODS: One hundred and eighty-eight patients assessed as having refractory angina, and not suitable for conventional forms of revascularization were randomized to receive TMLR and medical management (94) or medical management alone (94). Costs to the UK NHS of TMLR (where appropriate), and all secondary sector health care contacts and cardiac-related medication in the 12 months following randomization, were collected. Patient utility as measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire was combined with 12-month survival data to generate quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The mean cost per patient over the year from hospitalization for TMLR was 11,470 pounds sterling and for medical management alone was 2586 pounds sterling, giving a cost difference of 8901 pounds sterling (95% confidence interval (CI) 7502 pounds sterling--10,008 pounds sterling: P < 0.0001). The mean QALY difference, in favour of TMLR was 0.039 (95% CI -0.033 to 0.113: P = 0.268). This gives an incremental cost per QALY of over 228,000 pounds sterling. Analysis of stochastic uncertainty and of sensitivity to gross changes in key parameters consistently produces very high costs per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The policy implications are clear: for such patients TMLR is an inefficient use of UK health service resources.

From March 1994 to July 1997, 274 patients with newly diagnosed, symptomatic multiple myeloma were enrolled in a prospective, non-randomized, population-based, multicenter study to evaluate the treatment with high-dose melphalan and autologous blood stem cell support. Health-related quality-of-life was measured prior to treatment and during follow-up, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Resource consumption was also recorded prospectively.

The aim of this study was to determine the incremental cost-utility (CU(inc)) of medical therapy for Crohn's disease (CD) perianal fistula. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate a 1-year treatment period with the following: 6-mercaptopurine and metronidazole [6MP/met] (comparator), 3 infliximab infusions + 6MP/met as second-line therapy (intervention I), infliximab with episodic reinfusion (intervention II), and 6MP/met + infliximab as second-line therapy (intervention III). Utilities were elicited from patients with CD and healthy individuals by standard gamble, and costs were obtained from hospital billing data. Uncertainty was assessed by sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: All strategies had similar effectiveness.

PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts of 1000 individuals infected with HIV. Outcome measures Projected life expectancy, cost-effectiveness in UK pound per life-year saved and per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved. RESULTS: Assuming a 2-year additional treatment effect of therapy with HAART produced incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of pound14 602 per life-year saved and pound17 698 per QALY saved.

1438,Cost-utility analysis of recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven) in six children with long-standing inhibitors to factor VIII or IX,"The high cost of treating patients with inhibitors in an environment of restricted budgets warrants consideration of cost-effectiveness. We determined the clinical response, effect on quality of life and the cost-effectiveness of treatment with rFVIIa in six boys with long-standing inhibitors to factors VIII or IX, compared with other treatment regimes previously used in these patients. The study used a longitudinal before-and-after design and was conducted in three phases. Phase 1 was 6 months preceding the introduction of rFVIIa, during which patients received on-demand 'usual care' with other treatment regimes; phase 2 was 6 months treatment on rFVIIa assessed retrospectively; and phase 3 was 6 months on rfVIIa treatment assessed prospectively. Treatment with rFVIIa was reserved for intrarticular, compartment, psoas, mucosal and suspected intracranial bleeding. Treatment outcomes were obtained by interview using structured questionnaires, the quality-of-life instruments CHQ CF-80 and CHQ PF-50, patient self-reporting diary, interrogation of hospital records, and the EuroQoL EQ-5D for utility valuations. Our results confirm that rFVIIa is clinically effective and resulted in 63-92% reductions in the number of re-treatments, duration of painful episodes, delay to initiation of treatment, days requiring wheelchair or crutches, emergency room visits and lost carer time compared with the patients' other therapies.

1439,Evaluating the benefits of increasing measles immunization rates,"OBJECTIVE: To calculate the cost-effectiveness, expressed in dollars per quality-adjusted life years (QALY), of increasing measles immunization rates. DATA SOURCES/STUDY DESIGN: Published data were supplemented by expert opinion. We determined the cost savings and value of the health benefits from averting a single case of measles. Next we examined the U. S. data regarding the relationship between pre-school measles immunization and incidence rates. Finally, we calculated the cost-effectiveness of a program that would increase a locality's immunization rate to the point of disease elimination. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Averting a single case of measles, using ""base case"" assumptions, yields societal cost savings of $2,089 and an increase of 0.086 QALYs. Using a very low discount rate increases the total benefits to $2,251 in societal cost savings and 0.150 QALYs in health benefits. In general, programs to raise measles immunization rates are not cost-effective, except possibly during an outbreak of the disease or in areas with very low immunization rates. The extremely low measles incidence rates in the mid-1990s result in such programs having extremely high costs per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Programs that are narrowly designed to increase immunization rates alone are not likely to be cost-effective. Yet these programs do have the potential to be cost-effective if the program design and evaluation also recognize the benefits associated with the primary and preventive care that can accompany immunizations. Such programs may also be cost-effective if they are components of a global eradication of measles.",2001-01-02196,11666109,Health Serv Res,J Zwanziger,2001,36 / 5,885-909,No,11666109,"J Zwanziger; P G Szilagyi; P Kaul; Evaluating the benefits of increasing measles immunization rates, Health Serv Res, 2001-Oct; 36(5):0017-9124; 885-909",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Supplemental effort to reach 90% local pre-school immunization rate vs. Pre-school immunization rate of 55%,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,48000,United States,1999,74567.39

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this investigation was to estimate the clinical impact, health-related quality of life, cost, and cost-effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroid therapy in a population of patients aged 18 years and over with FEV(1) = 60% to 100% of predicted normal. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of quick relievers (eg, short-acting beta-agonists) on an as-needed basis plus inhaled corticosteroid therapy versus quick relievers alone. A mathematical simulation model was developed to forecast symptoms, acute exacerbations, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), health care costs, and cost-effectiveness, measured in both dollars per QALY gained and dollars per symptom-free day gained. All evaluation outcomes were discounted at an annual rate of 3% and measured over a 10-year planning horizon. Data on the natural history of disease, drug efficacy, patient preferences, and economic costs were obtained from a variety of observational cohorts, randomized trials, and patient surveys. RESULTS: Over a 10-year period, use of inhaled corticosteroids increases total health costs from roughly $5,200 to $8,400 and improves QALYs from 6.8 to 7.0, implying an incremental cost of $13,500 per QALY gained. Costs per symptom-free day gained are $7.50. Both per-person acute exacerbations and hospitalizations are reduced by 33%. The cost-effectiveness findings are sensitive to the assumed efficacy and side-effects of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled corticosteroids appear to deliver good comparative value in adults with mild-to-moderate asthma.

1441,A cost-effectiveness analysis of stays in intensive care units,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient outcome and the efficiency of stays in intensive care units (ICUs). DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Seven ICUs of teaching hospitals in the Paris area. PATIENTS: Two hundred eleven stays including one in three consecutive patients admitted from September to November 1996. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For each patient, the following information was collected during the ICU stay: diagnosis, severity scores, organ failures, workload, cost and mortality. A cost-effectiveness ratio was computed for 176 stays with at least one organ failure, at hospital discharge and 6 months later. Quality of life was measured with EuroQol questionnaires 6 months after discharge in 64 patients representing 62 % of the patients contacted. The mean total ICU cost per stay was US$ 14,130 (+/- 6,550) (higher for non-survivors--US$ 19,060, median 10,590--than for survivors US$ 12,370, median 5,780). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$ 1,150 per life-year saved and the incremental cost-utility ratio was US$ 4,100 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, without discounting. These results compare favourably with other health-care options. However substantial variations were observed according to age, severity, diagnosis, number of organ failures and discount rate. Intoxication had the lowest ratio (US$ 620/QALY) and acute renal insufficiency the highest (US$ 30,625/QALY).

1442,Are aggressive treatment strategies less cost-effective for older patients? The case of ventilator support and aggressive care for patients with acute respiratory failure,"OBJECTIVES: A common assumption is that life-sustaining treatments are much less cost-effective for older patients than for younger patients. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing mechanical ventilation and intensive care for patients of various ages who had acute respiratory failure. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data on acute respiratory failure from Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT). SETTING: Acute hospital. PARTICIPANTS: 1,005 with acute respiratory failure; 963 received ventilator support and 42 had ventilator support withheld. MEASUREMENTS: We studied 1,005 patients enrolled in a five-center study of seriously ill patients (SUPPORT) with acute respiratory failure (pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and an Acute Physiology Score > or = 10) requiring ventilator support. For cost-effectiveness analyses, we estimated life expectancy based on long-term follow-up of SUPPORT patients and estimated utilities (quality-of-life weights) using time-tradeoff questions. We used hospital fiscal data and Medicare data to estimate healthcare costs. We divided patients into three age groups (< 65, 65-74, and > or = 75 years); for each age group, we performed separate analyses for patients with a < or = 50% probability of surviving at least 2 months (high-risk group) and those with a > 50% probability of surviving at least 2 months (low-risk group). RESULTS: Of the 963 patients who received ventilator support, 44% were female; 48% survived 6 months; and the median (25th, 75th percentile) age was 63 (46, 75) years. For the 42 patients for whom ventilator support was withheld, the median survival was 3 days. For low-risk patients (> 50% estimated 2-month survival), the incremental cost (1998 dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved by providing ventilator support and aggressive care increased across the three age groups ($32,000 for patients age < 65, $44,000 for those age 65-74, and $46,000 for those age > or = 75). For high-risk patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness was much less favorable and was least favorable for younger patients ($130,000 for patients age < 65, $100,000 for those age 65-74, and $96,000 for those age > or = 75). When we varied our assumptions from 50% to 200% of our baseline estimates in sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to the costs of the index hospitalization.

1460,The cost utility analysis of riluzole for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the UK,"This study reports the results of a long-term economic evaluation of riluzole in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) versus best supportive care in the United Kingdom. The aim was to assess the cost implications of the life extension offered by riluzole through cost utility analysis based on patient assessed utilities of different health states.A Markov model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of Rilutek with best supportive care. Transition possibilities and the distribution of patients by health states were taken from a cohort of 954 patients drawn from a large randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial between 1992 and 1994 in the first 18 months and used to extrapolate the model to assess the long-term prolongation of life. Four distinct health states were used corresponding to mild, moderate, severe and terminal states. Costs associated with Rilutek included the acquisition cost and bi-monthly monitoring for raised ALT levels. Patient assessed utilities were collected by use of the standard gamble technique. 77 patients were entered into the study from two centres (King's, London and Preston) in the UK. Mean utilities for each of the health states was generated and, given that the data were skewed, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken with the median utility values.The implications of life extension offered by riluzole versus best supportive care were assessed both in terms of life extension projected and quality adjusted survival using patient based utilities. Using the Markov model and the transitional probabilities the base case cost per life year gained was estimated at pound sterlings 14,370 and applying Standard Gamble utility scores, the base case cost per QALY was assessed as pound sterlings 20,904. The effect of discounting costs and benefits altered the cost effectiveness analysis to pound sterlings 17,760 per life year gained while a sensitivity analysis around median or mean scores for the utility weight resulted in a range of pound sterlings 19,020 to pound sterlings 25,794 per QALY gained.",2001-01-02201,11676998,J Neurol Sci,M Tavakoli,2001,191 / 1-2,95-102,No,11676998,"M Tavakoli; M Malek; The cost utility analysis of riluzole for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in the UK, J Neurol Sci, 2001-Oct-15; 191(1-2):0022-510X; 95-102",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Riluzole vs. Best supportive care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,Not Stated,20904,United Kingdom,1998,55009.53

1465,The cost-effectiveness of neonatal surgery and subsequent treatment for congenital anorectal malformations,"BACKGROUND/PURPOSE:The progress made in all fields of medicine, including neonatal surgery, has contributed to the rise in healthcare costs. Although neonatal surgery may provide survival gains, these could be at the expense of worse quality of life caused by impairment after surgery. For example, congenital anorectal malformations (CAM) are complex anomalies, and the surgical techniques available have their limitations in achieving continence. It therefore seems justifiable to consider what the effects of treatment are in relation to the costs. Evidence of the cost-effectiveness of neonatal surgery, however, is lacking. METHODS: The authors analyzed both direct and indirect, medical and nonmedical costs in patients who had undergone treatment for CAM. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire. Descriptive quality-of-life data were collected using a disease-specific questionnaire and a medical consumption questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean costs of treatment are calculated at Euro 31,593. Treated CAM patients suffer stool difficulties and their medical consumption is relatively high. The EQ-5D, however, shows that the quality of life of CAM patients is only slightly lower than that of the general population (0.88 v 0.93). Treatment results in a gain of 12.7 QALYs.

1467,Cost-effectiveness of oral anticoagulants versus aspirin in patients after infrainguinal bypass grafting surgery,"PURPOSE: Several antithrombotic therapies are available for the treatment of patients with peripheral vascular diseases. It is unknown how quality of life and costs of treatment are influenced by different therapies. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of oral anticoagulants versus aspirin in patients after infrainguinal bypass grafting surgery. METHODS: Clinical outcome events and event-free survival were collected from 2650 patients in 77 centers who participated in the Dutch Bypass Oral anticoagulants or Aspirin trial. Approximately half the patients had critical ischemia; 60% received vein grafts, and 20% had femorocrural bypass grafts. A model that was primarily driven by clinical outcome events was used as a means of determining quality of life (EuroQol EQ-5D) and costs for each patient. The main outcome measure was the incremental health care costs in relation to the additional number of quality-adjusted life years and the additional number of event-free years. RESULTS: The mean costs during the 21 months of follow-up were epsilon 6875 per patient in the oral anticoagulants group versus epsilon 7072 in the aspirin group (difference, 197; 95% CI, -746 to 343). The event-free survival was 1.10 years in the group treated with oral anticoagulants versus 1.09 years in the group treated with aspirin (difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.08), whereas the corresponding quality-adjusted life years were 1.06 and 1.05, respectively (difference, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.06). CONCLUSION: Health care costs, event-free survival, and quality-adjusted life years in patients after infrainguinal bypass surgery were not different in patients treated with aspirin and patients treated with oral anticoagulants. The extra costs of monitoring patients treated with oral anticoagulants were limited and play no role in the decision for treatment.",2001-01-02205,11496277,J Vasc Surg,J B Oostenbrink,2001,34 / 2,254-62,No,11496277,"J B Oostenbrink; M J Tangelder; J J Busschbach; B A van Hout; E Buskens; A Algra; J A Lawson; B C Eikelboom; Cost-effectiveness of oral anticoagulants versus aspirin in patients after infrainguinal bypass grafting surgery, J Vasc Surg, 2001-Aug; 34(2):0741-5214; 254-62",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral anticoagulants vs. Aspirin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,21 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Euro,1996,Not Stated
1468,Cost-effectiveness of prenatal screening for postpartum thyroiditis,"Five percent of all pregnant women and 25% of pregnant women with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) develop postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) during the first year after delivery. PPT has significant morbidity and can be predicted prenatally by the presence of thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody. Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening pregnant women for the TPO antibody versus the current strategy of no screening test or an alternative strategy of a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test 6 weeks postpartum. We performed cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision tree model that accounted for cases of PPT detected, medical outcomes of screening, and costs of screening and care. Hypothetical cohorts of 1000 pregnant women with uncomplicated pregnancies and 1000 pregnant women with IDDM were used to determine direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life years, and cases of PPT detected. The cost of testing 1000 pregnant women for TSH at the 6 week postpartum visit was $75,000, with an effectiveness of 995.2 quality-adjusted life years resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $48,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Checking a TPO antibody was more effective (995.5 quality-adjusted life years) but also more expensive ($93,000). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the TPO antibody strategy was $60,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Results were most sensitive to changes in the test characteristics, incidence of disease, and percentage of women with PPT who were symptomatic.

1472,Cost-effectiveness of vitamin therapy to lower plasma homocysteine levels for the prevention of coronary heart disease: effect of grain fortification and beyond,"CONTEXT: A high homocysteine level has been identified as an independent modifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) events and death. Since January 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration has required that all enriched grain products contain 140 microg of folic acid per 100 g, a level considered to decrease homocysteine levels. OBJECTIVES: To examine the potential effect of grain fortification with folic acid on CHD events and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of additional vitamin supplementation (folic acid and cyanocobalamin) for CHD prevention. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis using the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model, a validated, state-transition model of CHD events in adults aged 35 through 84 years. Data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) were used to estimate age- and sex-specific differences in homocysteine levels. INTERVENTION: Hypothetical comparison between a diet that includes enriched grain products projected to increase folic acid intake by 100 microg/d with the same diet without folic acid fortification; and a comparison between vitamin therapy that consists of 1 mg of folic acid and 0.5 mg of cyanocobalamin and the diet that includes grains fortified with folic acid. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of myocardial infarction and death from CHD, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved, and medical costs. RESULTS: Grain fortification with folic acid was predicted to decrease CHD events by 8% in women and 13% in men, with comparable reductions in CHD mortality. The model projected that, compared with grain fortification alone, treating all patients with known CHD with folic acid and cyanocobalamin over a 10-year period would result in 310 000 fewer deaths and lower costs. Over the same 10-year period, providing vitamin supplementation in addition to grain fortification to all men aged 45 years or older without known CHD was projected to save more than 300 000 QALYs, to save more than US $2 billion, and to be the preferred strategy. For women without CHD, the preferred vitamin supplementation strategy would be to treat all women older than 55 years, a strategy projected to save more than 140 000 QALYs over 10 years.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective of 2 quality improvement (QI) interventions to improve treatment of depression in primary care and their effects on patient employment. DESIGN: Group-level randomized controlled trial conducted June 1996 to July 1999. SETTING: Forty-six primary care clinics in 6 community-based managed care organizations. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eighty-one primary care clinicians and 1356 patients with positive screening results for current depression. INTERVENTIONS: Matched practices were randomly assigned to provide usual care (n = 443 patients) or to 1 of 2 QI interventions offering training to practice leaders and nurses, enhanced educational and assessment resources, and either nurses for medication follow-up (QI-meds; n = 424 patients) or trained local psychotherapists (QI-therapy; n = 489). Practices could flexibly implement the interventions, which did not assign type of treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total health care costs, costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), days with depression burden, and employment over 24 months, compared between usual care and the 2 interventions. RESULTS: Relative to usual care, average health care costs increased $419 (11%) in QI-meds (P =.35) and $485 (13%) in QI-therapy (P =.28); estimated costs per QALY gained were between $15 331 and $36 467 for QI-meds and $9478 and $21 478 for QI-therapy; and patients had 25 (P =.19) and 47 (P =.01) fewer days with depression burden and were employed 17.9 (P =.07) and 20.9 (P =.03) more days during the study period.

Practices could flexibly implement the interventions, which did not assign type of treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total health care costs, costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), days with depression burden, and employment over 24 months, compared between usual care and the 2 interventions. RESULTS: Relative to usual care, average health care costs increased $419 (11%) in QI-meds (P =.35) and $485 (13%) in QI-therapy (P =.28); estimated costs per QALY gained were between $15 331 and $36 467 for QI-meds and $9478 and $21 478 for QI-therapy; and patients had 25 (P =.19) and 47 (P =.01) fewer days with depression burden and were employed 17.9 (P =.07) and 20.9 (P =.03) more days during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Societal cost-effectiveness of practice-initiated QI efforts for depression is comparable with that of accepted medical interventions.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the costs and effectiveness of several different options for AED deployment in the US commercial air transportation system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND SUBJECTS: Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis of a strategy of full deployment on all aircraft as well as several strategies of partial deployment only on larger aircraft, compared with a baseline strategy of no AEDs on aircraft (but training flight attendants in basic life support) for a hypothetical cohort of persons experiencing cardiac arrest aboard US commercial aircraft. Estimates for costs and outcomes were obtained from the medical literature, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Air Transport Association of America, a population-based cohort of Medicare patients, AED manufacturers, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted survival after cardiac arrest; costs of AED deployment on aircraft and of medical care for cardiac arrest survivors. RESULTS: Adding AEDs on passenger aircraft with more than 200 passengers would cost $35 300 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Additional AEDs on aircraft with capacities between 100 and 200 persons would cost an additional $40 800 per added QALY compared with deployment on large-capacity aircraft only, and full deployment on all passenger aircraft would cost an additional $94 700 per QALY gained compared with limited deployment on aircraft with capacity greater than 100. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the quality of life, annual mortality rate, and the effectiveness of AEDs in improving survival were the most influential factors in the model.

1484,Economic evaluation of aquatic exercise for persons with osteoarthritis,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate cost and outcomes of the Arthritis Foundation aquatic exercise classes from the societal perspective. DESIGN: Randomized trial of 20-week aquatic classes. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained was estimated using trial data. Sample size was based on 80% power to reject the null hypothesis that the cost/QALY gained would not exceed $50,000. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Recruited 249 adults from Washington State aged 55 to 75 with a doctor-confirmed diagnosis of osteoarthritis to participate in aquatic classes. The Quality of Well-Being Scale (QWB) and Current Health Desirability Rating (CHDR) were used for economic evaluation, supplemented by the arthritis-specific Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and Perceived Quality of Life Scale (PQOL) collected at baseline and postclass. Outcome results applied to life expectancy tables were used to estimate QALYs. Use of health care facilities was assessed from diaries/questionnaires and Medicare reimbursement rates used to estimate costs. Nonparametric bootstrap sampling of costs/QALY ratios established the 95% CI around the estimates. RESULTS: Aquatic exercisers reported equal (QWB) or better (CHDR, HAQ, PQOL) health-related quality of life compared with controls. Outcomes improved with regular class attendance. Costs/QALY gained discounted at 3% were $205,186 using the QWB and $32,643 using the CHRD. CONCLUSION: Aquatic exercise exceeded $50,000 per QALY gained using the community-weighted outcome but fell below this arbitrary budget constraint when using the participant-weighted measure.

1487,The cost effectiveness of combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV disease,"BACKGROUND: Combination antiretroviral therapy with a combination of three or more drugs has become the standard of care for patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States. We estimated the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of three-drug antiretroviral regimens. METHODS: We developed a mathematical simulation model of HIV disease, using the CD4 cell count and HIV RNA level as predictors of the progression of disease. Outcome measures included life expectancy, life expectancy adjusted for the quality of life, lifetime direct medical costs, and cost effectiveness in dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained. Clinical data were derived from major clinical trials, including the AIDS Clinical Trials Group 320 Study. Data on costs were based on the national AIDS Cost and Services Utilization Survey, with drug costs obtained from the Red Book. RESULTS: For patients similar to those in the AIDS Clinical Trials Group 320 Study (mean CD4 cell count, 87 per cubic millimeter), life expectancy adjusted for the quality of life increased from 1.53 to 2.91 years, and per-person lifetime costs increased from $45,460 to $77,300 with three-drug therapy as compared with no therapy. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted year of life gained, as compared with no therapy, was $23,000. On the basis of additional data from other major studies, the cost-effectiveness ratio for three-drug therapy ranged from $13,000 to $23,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. The initial CD4 cell count and drug costs were the most important determinants of costs, clinical benefits, and cost effectiveness.

1488,Deep brain stimulation in the treatment of Parkinson's disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: In treating PD, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown great promise in a series of uncontrolled studies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of DBS compared with the best medical management in late-stage PD. METHODS: The authors constructed a decision model to determine the lifetime incremental cost effectiveness between two options in patients with PD aged 50 years and older: 1) best medical management and 2) DBS. As the long-term efficacy of DBS (>3 years) is not known, key assumptions regarding the procedure's long-term durability were made. Costs were in US 2000 dollars, and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was the effectiveness measure. Base assumptions were that quality of life (QOL) in patients with late-stage PD is 0.55 (0-to-1 scale, 1 is perfect health) and that DBS benefits are constant for 4 years, eroding gradually over the next 5 years until at parity with those produced by best medical management. Incremental cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, DBS provides an additional 0.72 QALY at an additional cost of $35,000 compared with best medical management that results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (C/E) of $49,000. QOL increases of between 18 and 30% resulted in questionable cost effectiveness. QOL increases of between 6 and 18% resulted in incremental C/E ratios not usually considered cost effective (>100,000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that DBS may be cost effective in treating PD if QOL improves 18% or more compared with those receiving best medical management.

1489,Cost-effectiveness of a trial of labor after previous cesarean,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effective method of delivery, from society's perspective, in patients who have had a previous cesarean. METHODS: We completed an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis of a trial of labor relative to cesarean using a computerized model for a hypothetical 30-year old parturient. The model incorporated data from peer-reviewed studies, actual hospital costs, and utilities to quantify health-related quality of life. A threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-years was used to define cost-effective. RESULTS: The model was most sensitive to the probability of successful vaginal delivery. If the probability of successful vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC) was less than 0.65, elective repeat cesarean was both less costly and more effective than a trial of labor. Between 0.65 and 0.74, elective repeat cesarean was cost-effective (the cost-effectiveness ratio was less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-years), because, although it cost more than VBAC, it was offset by improved outcomes. Between 0.74 and 0.76, trial of labor was cost-effective. If the probability of successful vaginal delivery exceeded 0.76, trial of labor became less costly and more effective. Costs associated with a moderately morbid neonatal outcome, as well as the probabilities of infant morbidity occurring, heavily impacted our results. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of VBAC depends on the likelihood of successful trial of labor. Our modeling suggests that a trial of labor is cost-effective if the probability of successful vaginal delivery is greater than 0.74. Improved algorithms are needed to more precisely estimate the likelihood that a patient with a previous cesarean will have a successful vaginal delivery.",2001-01-02214,11384699,Obstet Gynecol,A Chung,2001,97 / 6,932-41,No,11384699,"A Chung; A Macario; Y Y El-Sayed; E T Riley; B Duncan; M L Druzin; Cost-effectiveness of a trial of labor after previous cesarean, Obstet Gynecol, 2001-Jun; 97(6):0029-7844; 932-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Elective repeat cesarean section vs. Vaginal birth (trial of labor),Not Stated,30 Years,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,112023,United States,2000,168366.93
1490,The cost-effectiveness of photodynamic therapy for fellow eyes with subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration,"PURPOSE: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently been demonstrated to be beneficial for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Herein, we determine the cost-effectiveness of PDT for the treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients with disciform degeneration in one eye and whose second and better-seeing eye develops visual loss secondary to predominantly classic subfoveal CNV. The analysis was performed from the perspective of a for-profit third-party insurer. DESIGN: Cost-utility Markov models were created to determine the cost-effectiveness of PDT under two different scenarios, by using efficacy data derived from the Treatment of Age-Related Macular Degeneration with Photodynamic Therapy (TAP) Study and patient-based utilities. METHODS: Decision analyses were performed by incorporating data from the TAP Study, expected longevity data, and patient-based utilities. Cost-effective models were then created by incorporating incremental medical costs. Various sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the robustness of our models. A Monte Carlo simulation was also used to determine whether there was a significant difference in quality-of-life adjusted years (QALYs) gained between PDT therapy and the placebo. RESULTS: For the hypothetical patient whose second and better-seeing eye becomes affected and who has 20/40 vision at baseline in this affected eye (base case 1), PDT was associated with a 10.7% relative increase in their quality-of-life (treatment conferred an additional undiscounted 0.1342 QALYs over a 2-year period). For the hypothetical patient whose second and better-seeing eye becomes affected and who has 20/200 vision at baseline in this affected eye (base case 2), PDT was associated with a 7.8% relative increase in their quality-of-life (treatment conferred an additional undiscounted 0.0669 QALYs over a 2-year period). Sensitivity analysis showed our models were robust and that PDT was usually the dominant treatment choice. Our cost-effective model demonstrated that the cost for a QALY was $86,721 (US dollars discounted at 3%) for base case 1, assuming 5.5 treatments; and $173,984 (USD discounted at 3%) for base case 2. CONCLUSIONS: PDT will cost a third-party insurer $86,721 for an AMD patient with 20/40 vision in the better-seeing eye to obtain one QALY and $173,984 for an AMD patient with 20/200 vision in the better-seeing eye to obtain one QALY. PDT can be considered to be a treatment that is of only minimal cost-effectiveness for AMD patients who have subfoveal CNV in their second and better-seeing eyes and who have good presenting visual acuity at baseline.

1492,Cost-effectiveness of preventing hip fracture in the general female population,"The aims of this study were to determine whether treatments that reduce the incidence of hip fracture might be used in the general female population rather than screening or case-finding strategies. Cost-effectiveness, measured as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained using threshold values for cost-effectiveness of $20,000 or $30,000/QALY gained, was assessed during and after treatment using a computer simulation model applied to the female population of Sweden. The base case assumed a 5-year intervention that reduced the risk of hip fracture by 35% during the treatment period, and an effect that reversed to the pretreatment risk during the next 5 years. Sensitivity analyses included the effects of age, different treatment costs and effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness was critically dependent upon the age and costs of intervention. Reasonable cost-effectiveness was shown even with relatively high intervention costs for women at average risk at the age of 84 years or more. For the cheapest interventions ($63/year) cost-effectiveness could be found from the age of 53 years.

1498,Cost effectiveness of nasal calcitonin in postmenopausal women: use of Cochrane Collaboration methods for meta-analysis within economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of nasal calcitonin (Miacalcin) compared with no therapy, alendronate or etidronate in the treatment of postmenopausal women with previous osteoporotic fracture. DESIGN AND SETTING: Meta-analysis followed by economic analysis. PERSPECTIVE: A Canadian provincial Ministry of Health. METHODS: The meta-analysis of randomised controlled clinical trials was based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration. Economic analysis was conducted within a Markov model using probabilities and costs derived from Canadian sources. RESULTS: The meta-analysis found evidence of the positive effect of both nasal calcitonin and alendronate in reducing the risks of hip, wrist and vertebral fractures in postmenopausal women. However, there was a lack of evidence of the effect of etidronate on hip and wrist fractures. For a 65-year-old woman, with 5 years' therapy, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for nasal calcitonin was 46,500 Canadian dollars ($Can) compared with no therapy and $Can32,600 compared with etidronate (1998 values). Comparison with alendronate was highly sensitive to the inclusion of one specific trial. CONCLUSIONS: Given the results of the analysis, based on current evidence, nasal calcitonin can be considered at the margins of being cost effective when compared with no therapy.
