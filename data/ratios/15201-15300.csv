15201,Cost-effectiveness of currently recommended direct-acting antiviral treatments in patients infected with genotypes 1 or 4 hepatitis C virus in the US,"OBJECTIVE: This study compared the cost-effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral therapies currently recommended for treating genotypes (GT) 1 and 4 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients in the US. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for CHC from a US payer''s perspective over a lifelong time horizon was performed. A Markov model based on the natural history of CHC was used for a population that included treatment-naive and -experienced patients. Treatment alternatives considered for GT1 included ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + dasabuvir +/- ribavirin (3D +/- R), sofosbuvir + ledipasvir (SOF/LDV), sofosbuvir + simeprevir (SOF + SMV), simeprevir + pegylated interferon/ribavirin (SMV + PR) and no treatment (NT). For GT4 treatments, ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir + ribavirin (2D + R), SOF/LDV and NT were compared. Transition probabilities, utilities and costs were obtained from published literature. Outcomes included rates of compensated cirrhosis (CC), decompensated cirrhosis (DCC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver-related death (LrD), total costs, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In GT1 patients, 3D +/- R and SOF-containing regimens have similar long-term outcomes; 3D +/- R had the lowest lifetime risks of all liver disease outcomes: CC = 30.2%, DCC = 5.0 %, HCC = 6.8%, LT = 1.9% and LrD = 9.2%. In GT1 patients, 3D +/- R had the lowest cost and the highest QALYs. As a result, 3D +/- R dominated these treatment options. In GT4 patients, 2D + R had lower rates of liver morbidity and mortality, lower cost and more QALYs than SOF/LDV and NT. LIMITATIONS: While the results are based on input values, which were obtained from a variety of heterogeneous sources-including clinical trials, the findings were robust across a plausible range of input values, as demonstrated in probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

15205,A cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis of first-line fidaxomicin for patients with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Germany,"PURPOSE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) represents a significant economic healthcare burden, especially the cost of recurrent disease. Fidaxomicin produced significantly lower recurrence rates and higher sustained cure rates in clinical trials. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of fidaxomicin compared with vancomycin in Germany in the first-line treatment of patient subgroups with CDI at increased risk of recurrence. METHODS: A semi-Markov model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of fidaxomicin vs. vancomycin from a payer perspective in Germany. The model cycle length was 10 days. The time horizon was 1 year. Model inputs were probability of clinical cure, 30-day probability of recurrence, and 30-day attributable mortality based on evidence from two randomized controlled trials comparing fidaxomicin and vancomycin in patients with CDI. Cost-effectiveness outcomes were cost per quality-adjusted life year gained, cost per bed-day saved, and cost per recurrence avoided. RESULTS: Despite higher drug acquisition costs, fidaxomicin was dominant in the cancer subgroup (less costly and more effective) and cost-effective in the other subgroups, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios vs. vancomycin ranging from euro26,900 to euro44,500. Hospitalization costs of the first-line treatment of CDI with fidaxomicin vs. vancomycin were lower in every patient subgroup, resulting in budget impacts ranging from -euro1325 (in patients >/=65 years) to -euro2438 (in cancer patients).

15211,Cost effectiveness and value of information analyses of islet cell transplantation in the management of 'unstable' type 1 diabetes mellitus,"BACKGROUND: Islet cell transplantation is a method to stabilize type 1 diabetes patients with hypoglycemia unawareness and unstable blood glucose levels by reducing insulin dependency and protecting against severe hypoglycemia through restoring endogenous insulin secretion. This study analyses the current cost-effectiveness of this technology and estimates the value of further research to reduce uncertainty around cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis using a Markov cohort model with a mean patient age of 49 to simulate costs and health outcomes over a life-time horizon. Our analysis used intensive insulin therapy (IIT) as comparator and took the provincial healthcare provider perspective. Cost and effectiveness data for up to four transplantations per patient came from the University of Alberta hospital. Costs are expressed in 2012 Canadian dollars and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and life years. To characterize the uncertainty around expected outcomes, we carried out a probabilistic sensitivity analysis within the Bayesian decision-analytic framework. We performed a value-of-information analysis to identify priority areas for future research under various scenarios. We applied a structural sensitivity analysis to assess the dependence of outcomes on model characteristics. RESULTS: Compared to IIT, islet cell transplantation using non-generic (generic) immunosuppression had additional costs of $150,006 ($112,023) per additional QALY, an average gain of 3.3 life years, and a probability of being cost-effective of 0.5 % (28.3 %) at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. At this threshold the non-generic technology has an expected value of perfect information (EVPI) of $260,744 for Alberta. This increases substantially in cost-reduction scenarios. The research areas with the highest partial EVPI are costs, followed by natural history, and effectiveness and safety. CONCLUSIONS: Current transplantation technology provides substantial improvements in health outcomes over conventional therapy for highly selected patients with 'unstable' type 1 diabetes. However, it is much more costly and so is not cost-effective. The value of further research into the cost-effectiveness is dependent upon treatment costs.

15212,Aflibercept vs. Ranibizumab: cost-effectiveness of treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration in Sweden,"PURPOSE: Monthly dosing with ranibizumab (RBZ) is needed to achieve maximal visual gains in patients with neovascular (''wet'') age-related macular degeneration (wAMD). In Sweden, dosing is performed as needed (RBZ PRN), resulting in suboptimal efficacy. Intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL) every 2 months after three initial monthly doses was clinically equivalent to RBZ monthly dosing (RBZ q4) in wAMD clinical trials. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of IVT-AFL versus RBZ q4 and RBZ PRN in Sweden. METHODS: A Markov model compared IVT-AFL to RBZ q4 or RBZ PRN over 2 years. Health states were based on visual acuity in better-seeing eye; a proportion discontinued treatment monthly or upon visual acuity <20/400. Parameters were estimated from trial data, published literature or expert opinion. Analyses were performed from a societal perspective with a lifetime horizon. The model calculated costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), discounted 3% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Lifetime cost of IVT-AFL was 578 400 SEK, compared with 565 700 SEK for RBZ PRN and 686 600 SEK for RBZ q4. Compared with RBZ PRN, the ICER of IVT-AFL was 27 000 SEK/QALY gained. RBZ q4 cost 20.4 million SEK/QALY gained versus IVT-AFL. Results were sensitive to IVT-AFL efficacy, but IVT-AFL had a 100% probability of being cost-effective versus both RBZ PRN and RBZ q4 at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 500 000 SEK.

This cost-effectiveness model compared strain-guided cardioprotection with other protective strategies using a health care payer perspective and five-year time horizon. METHODS: Three cardioprotection strategies were assessed: 1) usual care (EF-guided cardioprotection, EFGCP) with cardioprotection initiated on diagnosis of LVEF-defined cardiotoxicity (EF-CTX), 2) universal cardioprotection (UCP) for all such patients, and 3) strain-guided cardioprotection (SGCP - treatment of patients with subclinical cardiotoxicity [S-CTX]). A Markov model, informed by the published literature on transitional probabilities, costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was developed to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Costs, effects and ICER of each specified cardioprotective strategy were assessed over a 5-year range, with sensitivity analyses for significant variables. RESULTS: In the reference case of a 49year old woman with stage IIb breast cancer treated with sequential anthracyclines and trastuzumab, strain-guided cardioprotection (3.79 QALYS and $4159 cost over 5years) dominated both UCP (3.64 QALYs and $5967 cost over 5years) and EFGCP (3.53 QALYs and $7033 cost over five years).

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of FOLFIRINOX versus GEM-N for treating metastatic pancreatic cancer based on the PRODIGE and MPACT trials. METHODS: A decision model was performed to compare FOLFIRINOX with GEM-N. Primary base case data were identified from PRODIGE and MPACT trials. Costs were estimated and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China. Survival benefits were reported in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Finally, sensitive analysis was performed by varying potentially modi fi able parameters in the model. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that FOLFIRINOX cost $37,203.75 and yielded a survival of 0.67 QALY, and GEM-N cost $32,080.59 and yielded a survival of 0.51 QALY in the entire treatment. Thus, the ICER of FOLFIRINOX versus GEM-N was $32,019.75 per QALY gained.

15217,"Cost-Effectiveness of Surgery, Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy, and Systemic Therapy for Pulmonary Oligometastases","INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary oligometastases have conventionally been managed with surgery and/or systemic therapy. However, given concerns about the high cost of systemic therapy and improvements in local treatment of metastatic cancer, the optimal cost-effective management of these patients is unclear. Therefore, we sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of initial management strategies for pulmonary oligometastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov modeling approach was used to compare average cumulative costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) among 3 initial disease management strategies: video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) wedge resection, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), and systemic therapy among 5 different cohorts of patient disease: (1) melanoma; (2) non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma without an EGFR mutation (NSCLC AC); (3) NSCLC with an EGFR mutation (NSCLC EGFRm AC); (4) NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma (NSCLC SCC); and (5) colon cancer. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to analyze uncertainty with regard to model parameters. RESULTS: In the base case, SBRT was cost effective for melanoma, with costs/net QALYs of $467,787/0.85. In patients with NSCLC, the most cost-effective strategies were SBRT for AC ($156,725/0.80), paclitaxel/carboplatin for SCC ($123,799/0.48), and erlotinib for EGFRm AC ($147,091/1.90).

However, given concerns about the high cost of systemic therapy and improvements in local treatment of metastatic cancer, the optimal cost-effective management of these patients is unclear. Therefore, we sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of initial management strategies for pulmonary oligometastases. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov modeling approach was used to compare average cumulative costs, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) among 3 initial disease management strategies: video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) wedge resection, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), and systemic therapy among 5 different cohorts of patient disease: (1) melanoma; (2) non-small cell lung cancer adenocarcinoma without an EGFR mutation (NSCLC AC); (3) NSCLC with an EGFR mutation (NSCLC EGFRm AC); (4) NSCLC squamous cell carcinoma (NSCLC SCC); and (5) colon cancer. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to analyze uncertainty with regard to model parameters. RESULTS: In the base case, SBRT was cost effective for melanoma, with costs/net QALYs of $467,787/0.85. In patients with NSCLC, the most cost-effective strategies were SBRT for AC ($156,725/0.80), paclitaxel/carboplatin for SCC ($123,799/0.48), and erlotinib for EGFRm AC ($147,091/1.90).

15227,Economic evaluation of fecal microbiota transplantation for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection in Australia,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Clostridium difficile is the most common cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea in Australia. In 2013, a randomized controlled trial demonstrated the effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for the treatment of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation-via either nasoduodenal or colorectal delivery-compared with vancomycin for the treatment of recurrent CDI in Australia. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of fecal microbiota transplantation compared with standard antibiotic therapy. A literature review of clinical evidence informed the structure of the model and the choice of parameter values. Clinical effectiveness was measured in terms of quality-adjusted life years. Uncertainty in the model was explored using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Both nasoduodenal and colorectal FMT resulted in improved quality of life and reduced cost compared with vancomycin. The incremental effectiveness of either FMT delivery compared with vancomycin was 1.2 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.3) quality-adjusted life years, or 1.4 (95% CI: 0.4, 2.4) life years saved.

15229,Cost-effectiveness of antiviral therapy during late pregnancy to prevent perinatal transmission of hepatitis B virus,"Background. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections are perinatally transmitted from chronically infected mothers. Supplemental antiviral therapy during late pregnancy with lamivudine (LAM), telbivudine (LdT), or tenofovir (TDF) can substantially reduce perinatal HBV transmission compared to postnatal immunoprophylaxis (IP) alone. However, the cost-effectiveness of these measures is not clear. Aim. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective of supplemental antiviral agents for preventing perinatal HBV transmission in mothers with high viral load (>6 log10 copies/mL). Methods. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were performed for the risk of perinatal HBV transmission with antiviral therapies. A decision analysis was conducted to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes in China of four competing strategies: postnatal IP alone (strategy IP), or in combination with perinatal LAM (strategy LAM + IP), LdT (strategy LdT + IP), or TDF (strategy TDF + IP). Antiviral treatments were administered from week 28 of gestation to 4 weeks after birth. Outcomes included treatment-related costs, number of infections, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed to identify influential clinical and cost-related variables. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to estimate the probabilities of being cost-effective for each strategy. Results. LdT + IP and TDF + IP averted the most infections and HBV-related deaths, and gained the most QALYs. IP and TDF + IP were dominated as they resulted in less or equal QALYs with higher associated costs. LdT + IP had an incremental $2,891 per QALY gained (95% CI [$932-$20,372]) compared to LAM + IP (GDP per capita for China in 2013 was $6,800). One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the cost-effectiveness of LdT + IP was only sensitive to the relative risk of HBV transmission comparing LdT + IP with LAM + IP. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that LdT + IP was cost-effective in most cases across willingness-to-pay range of $6,800 approximately $20,400 per QALY gained. Conclusions.

15235,Cost-Effectiveness of Sacubitril-Valsartan Combination Therapy Compared With Enalapril for the Treatment of Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of sacubitril-valsartan relative to enalapril for treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). BACKGROUND: Compared with enalapril, combination angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibition (ARNI), as is found in sacubitril-valsartan, reduces cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalization rates in patients with HFrEF. METHODS: Using a Markov model, costs, effects, and cost-effectiveness were estimated for sacubitril-valsartan and enalapril therapies for the treatment of HFrEF. Patients were 60 years of age at model entry and were modeled over a lifetime (40 years) from a third-party payer perspective. Clinical probabilities were derived predominantly from PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure). All costs and effects were discounted at a 3% rate annually and are presented in 2015 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: In the base case, sacubitril-valsartan, compared with enalapril, was more costly ($60,391 vs. $21,758) and more effective (6.49 vs. 5.74 QALYs) over a lifetime. The cost-effectiveness of sacubitril-valsartan was highly dependent on duration of treatment, ranging from $249,411 per QALY at 3 years to $50,959 per QALY gained over a lifetime.

15238,An Economic Analysis of Strategies to Control Clostridium Difficile Transmission and Infection Using an Agent-Based Simulation Model,"BACKGROUND: A number of strategies exist to reduce Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) transmission. We conducted an economic evaluation of ""bundling"" these strategies together. METHODS: We constructed an agent-based computer simulation of nosocomial C. difficile transmission and infection in a hospital setting. This model included the following components: interactions between patients and health care workers; room contamination via C. difficile shedding; C. difficile hand carriage and removal via hand hygiene; patient acquisition of C. difficile via contact with contaminated rooms or health care workers; and patient antimicrobial use. Six interventions were introduced alone and ""bundled"" together: (a) aggressive C. difficile testing; (b) empiric isolation and treatment of symptomatic patients; (c) improved adherence to hand hygiene and (d) contact precautions; (e) improved use of soap and water for hand hygiene; and (f) improved environmental cleaning. Our analysis compared these interventions using values representing 3 different scenarios: (1) base-case (BASE) values that reflect typical hospital practice, (2) intervention (INT) values that represent implementation of hospital-wide efforts to reduce C. diff transmission, and (3) optimal (OPT) values representing the highest expected results from strong adherence to the interventions. Cost parameters for each intervention were obtained from published literature. We performed our analyses assuming low, normal, and high C. difficile importation prevalence and transmissibility of C. difficile. RESULTS: INT levels of the ""bundled"" intervention were cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year in all importation prevalence and transmissibility scenarios. OPT levels of intervention were cost-effective for normal and high importation prevalence and transmissibility scenarios. When analyzed separately, hand hygiene compliance, environmental decontamination, and empiric isolation and treatment were the interventions that had the greatest impact on both cost and effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of available interventions to prevent CDI is likely to be cost-effective but the cost-effectiveness varies for different levels of intensity of the interventions depending on epidemiological conditions such as C. difficile importation prevalence and transmissibility.",2016-01-19763,27031464,PLoS One,Richard E Nelson,2016,11 / 3,e0152248,No,27031464,"Richard E Nelson; Makoto Jones; Molly Leecaster; Matthew H Samore; William Ray; Angela Huttner; Benedikt Huttner; Karim Khader; Vanessa W Stevens; Dale Gerding; Marin L Schweizer; Michael A Rubin; An Economic Analysis of Strategies to Control Clostridium Difficile Transmission and Infection Using an Agent-Based Simulation Model, PLoS One , 2016; 11(3):1932-6203; e0152248",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Package of 6 intervention strategies administered at a level reflecting an improvement over current hospital settings that could reasonably be expected from typical adherence to an effort focusing on that particular strategy, in a medium-level setting of both importation and transmissibility.

15239,Economic analysis of temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) for the treatment of patients with severe persistent allergic asthma,"INTRODUCTION: Chronic asthma is a significant burden for individual sufferers, adversely impacting their quality of working and social life, as well as being a major cost to the National Health Service (NHS). Temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) therapy provides asthma patients at BTS/SIGN step 4/5 an add-on treatment option that is non-invasive and has been shown in clinical studies to improve quality of life for patients with poorly controlled allergic asthma. The objective of this study was to quantify the cost-effectiveness of TLA (Airsonett AB) technology as an add-on to standard asthma management drug therapy in the UK. METHODS: The main performance measure of interest is the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for patients using TLA in addition to usual care versus usual care alone. The incremental cost of TLA use is based on an observational clinical study monitoring the incidence of exacerbations with treatment valued using NHS cost data. The clinical effectiveness, used to derive the incremental QALY data, is based on a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial comprising participants with an equivalent asthma condition. RESULTS: For a clinical cohort of asthma patients as a whole, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is pound8998 per QALY gained, that is, within the pound20 000/QALY cost-effectiveness benchmark used by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Sensitivity analysis indicates that ICER values range from pound18 883/QALY for the least severe patients through to TLA being dominant, that is, cost saving as well as improving quality of life, for individuals with the most severe and poorly controlled asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our results, Airsonett TLA is a cost-effective addition to treatment options for stage 4/5 patients. For high-risk individuals with more severe and less well controlled asthma, the use of TLA therapy to reduce incidence of hospitalisation would be a cost saving to the NHS.",2016-01-19773,27026803,BMJ Open Respir Res,Peter Brazier,2016,3 / 1,e000117,No,27026803,"Peter Brazier; Uwe Schauer; Eckard Hamelmann; Steve Holmes; Clive Pritchard; John O Warner; Economic analysis of temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) for the treatment of patients with severe persistent allergic asthma, BMJ Open Respir Res, 2016; 3(1):2052-4439; e000117",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Temperature-controlled laminar airflow (TLA) therapy installation for a period of 12 months as an add-on to standard asthma management with drug therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- pharmaceutical therapy only,"Patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma (BTS/SIGN 4/5), uncontrolled despite pharmacological treatment",70 Years,8 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,8998,United Kingdom,2014,16215.72
15240,The Clinical and Economic Benefits of Co-Testing Versus Primary HPV Testing for Cervical Cancer Screening: A Modeling Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Consensus United States cervical cancer screening guidelines recommend use of combination Pap plus human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for women aged 30 to 65 years. An HPV test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2014 for primary cervical cancer screening in women age 25 years and older. Here, we present the results of clinical-economic comparisons of Pap plus HPV mRNA testing including genotyping for HPV 16/18 (co-testing) versus DNA-based primary HPV testing with HPV 16/18 genotyping and reflex cytology (HPV primary) for cervical cancer screening. METHODS: A health state transition (Markov) model with 1-year cycling was developed using epidemiologic, clinical, and economic data from healthcare databases and published literature. A hypothetical cohort of one million women receiving triennial cervical cancer screening was simulated from ages 30 to 70 years. Screening strategies compared HPV primary to co-testing. Outcomes included total and incremental differences in costs, invasive cervical cancer (ICC) cases, ICC deaths, number of colposcopies, and quality-adjusted life years for cost-effectiveness calculations. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In a simulation cohort of one million 30-year-old women modeled up to age 70 years, the model predicted that screening with HPV primary testing instead of co-testing could lead to as many as 2,141 more ICC cases and 2,041 more ICC deaths. In the simulation, co-testing demonstrated a greater number of lifetime quality-adjusted life years (22,334) and yielded $39.0 million in savings compared with HPV primary, thereby conferring greater effectiveness at lower cost. CONCLUSIONS: Model results demonstrate that co-testing has the potential to provide improved clinical and economic outcomes when compared with HPV primary.

15241,The Cost-Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Detection with the Use of Prostate Health Index,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trial results suggested that prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening can reduce prostate cancer mortality. Nevertheless, because the specificity of the PSA test for cancer detection is low, it leads to many negative biopsies. The Beckman Coulter Prostate Health Index (PHI) testing demonstrates improved specificity compared with the PSA-only screening and therefore may improve the cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer detection. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of adding PHI testing to improve cancer detection for men with elevated serum PSA. METHODS: A microsimulation model, based on the results of the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer trial, was used to evaluate the effects of PSA screening and PHI reflex testing. We predicted the numbers of prostate cancers, negative biopsies, deaths, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cost-effectiveness of both PSA (cutoff 3 ng/mL) and PHI (cutoff 25) testing methods for a European population, screened from age 50 to 75 years at 4-year intervals. RESULTS: When the PHI test was added to the PSA screening, for men with a PSA between 3 and 10 ng/mL, the model predicted a 23% reduction in negative biopsies. This would lead to a 17% reduction in costs for diagnostics and 1% reduction in total costs for prostate cancer. The cost-effectiveness (3.5% discounted) was 11% better. Limitations found were the modeling assumptions on the sensitivity and specificity of PHI by tumor stage and cutoff values. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with PSA-only screening, the use of a PHI test can substantially reduce the number of negative biopsies and improve the cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer detection.",2016-01-19787,27021748,Value Health,Eveline A M Heijnsdijk,2016,19 / 2,153-7,Yes,27021748,"Eveline A M Heijnsdijk; Dwight Denham; Harry J de Koning; The Cost-Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Detection with the Use of Prostate Health Index, Value Health, 2016 Mar; 19(2):1098-3015; 153-7",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,The Beckman Coulter Prostate Health Index (PHI) for prostate cancer detection vs. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,50 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.50,Not Stated,Euro,2014,Not Stated

We built a decision-analytic-model to project the lifetime clinical and economic consequences of different clinical management strategies for CUP. The model was parameterized using follow-up data from the Manitoba Cancer Registry, cost data from Manitoba Health administrative databases and secondary sources. The 2000-GEP-based strategy compared to current clinical practice resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $44,151 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. The total annual-budget impact was $36.2 million per year. A value-of-information analysis revealed that the expected value of perfect information about the test''s clinical impact was $4.2 million per year.

15243,Cost Effectiveness of Operative Versus Non-Operative Treatment of Geriatric Type-II Odontoid Fracture,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of operative versus non-operative treatment of type-II odontoid fractures in patients older than 64 years old. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Significant controversy exists regarding the optimum treatment of geriatric patients with type-II odontoid fractures. Operative treatment leads to lower rates of non-union but carries surgical risks. Non-operative treatment does not carry surgical risks but has higher non-union rates. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was created to compare operative and non-operative treatment of type-II odontoid fractures among three age cohorts (65-74, 75-84, >84) based on expected costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; cost per QALY gained). Age-specific mortality rates for both treatments, costs for treatment, and complication rates were taken from the literature, and data from 2010 US life tables were used for age-specific life expectancy. Costs of complications were estimated using data obtained at a level-I trauma center using micro-costing. Sensitivity analyses of all model parameters were conducted. RESULTS: Among the 65- to 74-year-old cohort, operative treatment was more costly ($53,407 vs. $30,553) and more effective (12.00 vs. 10.11 QALY), with an ICER of $12,078/QALY. Among the 75- to 84-year-old cohort, operative treatment was more costly ($51,308 vs. $29,789) and more effective (6.85 vs. 6.31 QALY), with an ICER of $40,467/QALY. Among the over-84 cohort, operative treatment was dominated by non-operative treatment as it was both more costly ($45,978 vs. $28,872) and less effective (2.48 vs. 3.73 QALY). The model was robust to sensitivity analysis across reasonable ranges for utility of union, disutility of complications and delayed surgery, and probabilities of non-union and complications. CONCLUSION: Operative treatment is cost-effective in patients age 65 to 84 when using $100,000/QALY as a benchmark but less effective and more costly than non-operative treatment in patients older than 84 years.

15244,Epidemiological and Economic Effects of Priming With the Whole-Cell Bordetella pertussis Vaccine,"IMPORTANCE: Current acellular pertussis vaccines may not protect against transmission of Bordetella pertussis. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a priming dose of whole-cell pertussis (wP) vaccine is cost-effective at reducing pertussis infection in infants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mathematical model of pertussis transmission fit to US incidence data in a simulation of the US population. In this simulation study conducted from June 2014 to May 2015, the population was divided into 9 age groups corresponding to the current pertussis vaccination schedule and fit to 2012 pertussis incidence. INTERVENTIONS: Inclusion of a priming dose of wP vaccine into the current acellular pertussis vaccination schedule. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reductions in symptomatic pertussis incidence by age group, increases in wP vaccine-related adverse effects, and quality-adjusted life-years owing to changing vaccine schedule. RESULTS: Switching to a wP-priming vaccination strategy could reduce whooping cough incidence by up to 95% (95% CI, 91-98), including 96% (95% CI, 92-98) fewer infections in neonates. Although there may be an increase in the number of vaccine adverse effects, we nonetheless estimate a 95% reduction in quality-adjusted life-years lost with a switch to the combined strategy and a cost reduction of 94% (95% CI, 91-97), saving more than $142 million annually. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our results suggest that an alternative vaccination schedule including 1 dose of wP vaccine may be highly cost-effective and ethically preferred until next-generation pertussis vaccines become available.",2016-01-19792,27018830,JAMA Pediatr,Haedi DeAngelis,2016,170 / 5,459-65,No,27018830,"Haedi DeAngelis; Samuel V Scarpino; Meagan C Fitzpatrick; Alison P Galvani; Benjamin M Althouse; Epidemiological and Economic Effects of Priming With the Whole-Cell Bordetella pertussis Vaccine, JAMA Pediatr, 2016 May 1; 170(5):2168-6211; 459-65",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Combined whole-cell pertussis vaccine vs. Acellular Pertussis Strategy: 5 doses of aP vaccine, given at ages 2 to 4 months, 4 to 6 months, 6 to 8 months, 18 to 24 months, and 4 to 5 years.",Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,120 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-81228.57,United States,2012,-91565.32
15245,The Economic Impact of Closed-Incision Negative-Pressure Therapy in High-Risk Abdominal Incisions: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Complex abdominal wall reconstruction is beset by postoperative complications. A recent meta-analysis comparing the use of closed-incision negative-pressure therapy to standard dressings found a statistically significant reduction in surgical-site infection. The use of closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is gaining acceptance in this population; however, the economic impact of this innovative dressing remains unknown. In this study, a cost-utility analysis was performed assessing closed-incision negative-pressure therapy and standard dressings following closure of abdominal incisions in high-risk patients. METHODS: Cost-utility methodology involved reviewing literature related to closed-incision negative-pressure therapy in abdominal wall surgery, obtaining utility estimates to calculate quality-adjusted life-year scores for successful surgery and surgery complicated by surgical-site infection, summing costs using Medicare Current Procedural Terminology codes, and creating a decision tree illuminating the most cost-effective dressing strategy. One-way sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The aforementioned meta-analysis comparing closed-incision negative-pressure therapy to standard dressings included a subset of five studies assessing abdominal wall surgery in 829 patients (260 closed-incision negative-pressure therapy and 569 standard dressings). Decision tree analysis revealed an estimated savings of $1546.52 and a gain of 0.0024 quality-adjusted life-year with closed-incision negative-pressure therapy compared with standard dressings; therefore, closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is a dominant treatment strategy. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that closed-incision negative-pressure therapy is a cost-effective option when the surgical-site infection rate is greater than 16.39 percent.

15246,Cost-Effectiveness of High-Dose Edoxaban Compared with Adjusted-Dose Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost-effectiveness of high-dose edoxaban compared with adjusted-dose warfarin in patients at risk for stroke who have nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and a creatinine clearance (Clcr ) of 15-95 ml/minute. METHODS: A Markov model was created to compare the cost-effectiveness of high-dose edoxaban and adjusted-dose warfarin in patients with a Clcr of 15-95 ml/minute. The model was performed from a U.S. societal perspective and assumed patients initiated therapy at 70 years of age, had a mean CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 or older, diabetes, stroke) score of 3, and no contraindications to anticoagulation. The model assumed a cycle length of 1 month and a lifetime horizon (maximum of 30 years/360 cycles). Data sources included renal subgroup analysis of the Effective Anticoagulation with Factor Xa Next Generation in Atrial Fibrillation (ENGAGE-AF) trial and other published studies. Outcomes included lifetime costs (2014 US$), QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The robustness of the model''s conclusions was tested using one-way and 10,000-iteration probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). RESULTS: Patients treated with high-dose edoxaban lived an average of 10.50 QALYs at a lifetime treatment cost of $99,833 compared with 10.11 QALYs and $123,516 for those treated with adjusted-dose warfarin. The model''s conclusions were found to be robust upon one-way sensitivity analyses. PSA suggested high-dose edoxaban was economically dominant compared with adjusted-dose warfarin in more than 99% of the 10,000 iterations run. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose edoxaban appears to be an economically dominant strategy when compared with adjusted-dose warfarin for the prevention of stroke in NVAF patients with a Clcr of 15-95 ml/minute and an appreciable risk of stroke.",2016-01-19800,27015873,Pharmacotherapy,Elaine Nguyen,2016,36 / 5,488-95,No,27015873,"Elaine Nguyen; Florence Egri; Elizabeth S Mearns; Charles M White; Craig I Coleman; Cost-Effectiveness of High-Dose Edoxaban Compared with Adjusted-Dose Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation Patients, Pharmacotherapy, 2016 May; 36(5):0277-0008; 488-95",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,High-dose edoxaban vs. Adjusted-dose warfarin,Creatinine clearance of 15-95 mL/minute,Not Stated,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-60725.64,United States,2014,-66388.15
15247,Cost-Effectiveness of Triple Therapy Versus Etanercept Plus Methotrexate in Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of all 4 interventions in the Treatment of Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis (TEAR) clinical trial: immediate triple (IT), immediate etanercept (IE), step-up triple (ST), and step-up etanercept (SE). Step-up interventions started with methotrexate and added either etanercept or sulfasalazine plus hydroxychloroquine to patients with persistent disease activity. METHODS: We built a Markov cohort model that uses individual-level data from the TEAR trial, published literature, and supplemental clinical data. Costs were in US dollars, benefits in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), perspective was societal, and the time horizon was 5 years. RESULTS: The immediate strategies were more efficacious than step-up strategies. SE and IE were more costly than ST and IT, primarily due to treatment cost differences. In addition, IT was the least expensive and most effective strategy when the time horizon was 1 and 2 years. When the time horizon was 5 years, IE was marginally more effective than IT (3.483 versus 3.476 QALYs), but IE was substantially more expensive than IT ($148,800 versus $52,600), producing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $12.5 million per QALY. These results were robust to both one-way deterministic and joint probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: IT was highly cost-effective in the majority of scenarios. Although IE was more effective in 5 years, a substantial reduction in the cost of biologic agents was required in order for IE to become cost-effective in early aggressive RA under willingness-to-pay thresholds that most health care settings may find acceptable.",2016-01-19801,27015606,Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken),Hawre Jalal,2016,68 / 12,,No,27015606,"Hawre Jalal; James R O'Dell; S Louis Jr Bridges; Stacey Cofield; Jeffrey R Curtis; Ted R Mikuls; Larry W Moreland; Kaleb Michaud; Cost-Effectiveness of Triple Therapy Versus Etanercept Plus Methotrexate in Early Aggressive Rheumatoid Arthritis, Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken), 2016 Dec; 68(12):2151-4658",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Immediate methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine vs. Etanercept plus methotrexate therapy",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-25392158,United States,2013,-28210226.8
15248,Trial-Based Cost-Utility Analysis of Icotinib versus Gefitinib as Second-Line Therapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in China,"BACKGROUND: Our objective is to compare the cost-utility of icotinib and gefitinib for the second-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. METHODS: Model technology was applied to assess the data of randomized clinical trials and the direct medical costs from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. Five-year quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed. RESULTS: Our model suggested that the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.2 months in the icotinib group and 3.5 months in the gefitinib group while they were 4.6 months and 3.4 months, respectively, in the trials. The 5-year QALYs was 0.279 in the icotinib group and 0.269 in the gefitinib group, and the according medical costs were $10662.82 and $13127.57. The ICUR/QALY of icotinib versus gefitinib presented negative in this study. The most sensitive parameter to the ICUR was utility of PFS, ranging from $-1,259,991.25 to $-182,296.61; accordingly the icotinib treatment consistently represented a dominant cost-utility strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The icotinib strategy, as a second-line therapy for advanced NSCLC patients in China, is the preferred strategy relative to gefitinib because of the dominant cost-utility. In addition, icotinib shows a good curative effect and safety, resulting in a strong demand for the Chinese market.",2016-01-19802,27015267,PLoS One,Chunxiang Zhang,2016,11 / 3,e0151846,No,27015267,"Chunxiang Zhang; Hongmei Zhang; Jinning Shi; Dong Wang; Xiuwei Zhang; Jian Yang; Qizhi Zhai; Aixia Ma; Trial-Based Cost-Utility Analysis of Icotinib versus Gefitinib as Second-Line Therapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in China, PLoS One , 2016; 11(3):1932-6203; e0151846",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Icotinib treatment vs. Gefitinib treatment, 250 mg per day",Histologically or cytologically confirmed Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC with progression after at least one platinum-based chemotherapy regimen.

Experts have suggested more personalized or more conservative strategies to improve benefit-risk tradeoffs, but the value of these strategies-particularly when combined with increased conservative management for low-risk cases-is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of plausible PSA screening strategies and to assess the value added by increased use of conservative management among low-risk, screen-detected cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A microsimulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality was created. A simulated contemporary cohort of US men beginning at 40 years of age underwent 18 strategies for PSA screening. Treatment strategies included (1) contemporary treatment practices based on age and cancer stage and grade observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program in 2010 or (2) selective treatment practices whereby cases with a Gleason score lower than 7 and clinical T2a stage cancer or lower are treated only after clinical progression, and all other cases undergo contemporary treatment practices. National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence of prostate cancer, treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, mortality, health-related quality of life, and direct medical expenditure were analyzed. Data were collected from March 18, 2009, to August 15, 2014, and analyzed from November 20, 2012, to December 11, 2015.

Experts have suggested more personalized or more conservative strategies to improve benefit-risk tradeoffs, but the value of these strategies-particularly when combined with increased conservative management for low-risk cases-is uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of plausible PSA screening strategies and to assess the value added by increased use of conservative management among low-risk, screen-detected cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A microsimulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality was created. A simulated contemporary cohort of US men beginning at 40 years of age underwent 18 strategies for PSA screening. Treatment strategies included (1) contemporary treatment practices based on age and cancer stage and grade observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program in 2010 or (2) selective treatment practices whereby cases with a Gleason score lower than 7 and clinical T2a stage cancer or lower are treated only after clinical progression, and all other cases undergo contemporary treatment practices. National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence of prostate cancer, treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, mortality, health-related quality of life, and direct medical expenditure were analyzed.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of plausible PSA screening strategies and to assess the value added by increased use of conservative management among low-risk, screen-detected cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A microsimulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality was created. A simulated contemporary cohort of US men beginning at 40 years of age underwent 18 strategies for PSA screening. Treatment strategies included (1) contemporary treatment practices based on age and cancer stage and grade observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program in 2010 or (2) selective treatment practices whereby cases with a Gleason score lower than 7 and clinical T2a stage cancer or lower are treated only after clinical progression, and all other cases undergo contemporary treatment practices. National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence of prostate cancer, treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, mortality, health-related quality of life, and direct medical expenditure were analyzed.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of plausible PSA screening strategies and to assess the value added by increased use of conservative management among low-risk, screen-detected cases. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A microsimulation model of prostate cancer incidence and mortality was created. A simulated contemporary cohort of US men beginning at 40 years of age underwent 18 strategies for PSA screening. Treatment strategies included (1) contemporary treatment practices based on age and cancer stage and grade observed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program in 2010 or (2) selective treatment practices whereby cases with a Gleason score lower than 7 and clinical T2a stage cancer or lower are treated only after clinical progression, and all other cases undergo contemporary treatment practices. National and trial data on PSA growth, screening and biopsy patterns, incidence of prostate cancer, treatment distributions, treatment efficacy, mortality, health-related quality of life, and direct medical expenditure were analyzed.

15277,Cryptococcal Meningitis Treatment Strategies Affected by the Explosive Cost of Flucytosine in the United States: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND: In the United States, cryptococcal meningitis causes approximately 3400 hospitalizations and approximately 330 deaths annually. The US guidelines recommend treatment with amphotericin B plus flucytosine for at least 2 weeks, followed by fluconazole for a minimum of 8 weeks. Due to generic drug manufacturer monopolization, flucytosine currently costs approximately $2000 per day in the United States, with a 2-week flucytosine treatment course costing approximately $28 000. The daily flucytosine treatment cost in the United Kingdom is approximately $22. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to determine the value of flucytosine relative to alternative regimens. METHODS: We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 3 cryptococcal induction regimens: (1) amphotericin B deoxycholate for 4 weeks; (2) amphotericin and flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks; and (3) amphotericin and fluconazole (800 mg/day) for 2 weeks. Costs of care were calculated using 2015 US prices and the medication costs. Survival estimates were derived from a randomized trial and scaled relative to published US survival data. RESULTS: Cost estimates were $83 227 for amphotericin monotherapy, $75 121 for amphotericin plus flucytosine, and $44 605 for amphotericin plus fluconazole. The ICER of amphotericin plus flucytosine was $23 842 per quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSIONS: Flucytosine is currently cost-effective in the United States despite a dramatic increase in price in recent years.

15281,Epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing vaccination against serogroup B meningococcal disease in France,"INTRODUCTION: Despite its low incidence in France, invasive serogroup B meningococcal disease remains a public health concern. A new vaccine against the disease, Bexsero((R)), has been licensed in the EU. We studied the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination using Bexsero((R)) in order to inform the decision-making process regarding its potential inclusion in the vaccination schedule. METHODS: A multi-generational Markov model was used. Time horizon was set to 100 years. Five vaccination strategies were evaluated: infants at 3, 5, 6 and 13 months, toddlers at 13, 15 and 27 months and adolescents at 15 years provided 2 doses one month apart. A booster dose at 15 years old and a catch-up for 15 years old subjects during the first 15 years of the programme were added to the infant and toddler strategies. Costs per QALY gained were computed from a restricted societal perspective including direct costs only. Herd immunity was simulated in an alternative base-case scenario and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis without herd immunity and with all cohorts vaccinated, at euro40 per vaccine dose, routine infant vaccination would provide the lowest cost per QALY gained (euro380,973) despite only preventing 18% of cases. Under the assumption of herd immunity, the adolescent vaccination would provide the lowest cost per QALY gained (euro135,902) preventing 24% of cases. Infant vaccination with a late booster and catch-up would prevent 51% of cases with a cost of euro188,511 per QALY gained.

15291,Cost-effectiveness of screening strategies to detect heart failure in patients with type 2 diabetes,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF), especially with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is common in older patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), but often not recognized. Early HF detection in older T2DM patients may be worthwhile because treatment may be initiated in an early stage, with clear beneficial treatment in those with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but without clear prognostic beneficial treatment in those with HFpEF. Because both types of HF may be uncovered in older T2DM, screening may improve health outcomes at acceptable costs. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of five screening strategies in patients with T2DM aged 60 years or over. METHODS: We built a Markov model with a lifetime horizon based on the prognostic results from our screening study of 581 patients with T2DM, extended with evidence from literature. Cost-effectiveness was calculated from a Dutch healthcare perspective as additional costs (Euros) per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess robustness of these outcomes. Scenario analyses were performed to assess the influence of the availability of effective treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. RESULTS: For willingness to pay values in the range of euro6050/QALY-euro31,000/QALY for men and euro6300/QALY-euro42,000/QALY for women, screening-based checking the electronic medical record for patient characteristics and medical history plus the assessment of symptoms had the highest probability of being cost-effective. For higher willingness-to-pay values, direct echocardiography was the preferred screening strategy. Cost-effectiveness of all screening strategies improved with the increase in effectiveness of treatment for HFpEF. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for HF in older community-dwelling patients with T2DM is cost-effective at the commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20.000/QALY by checking the electronic medical record for patient characteristics and medical history plus the assessment of symptoms.

METHODS: We built a Markov model with a lifetime horizon based on the prognostic results from our screening study of 581 patients with T2DM, extended with evidence from literature. Cost-effectiveness was calculated from a Dutch healthcare perspective as additional costs (Euros) per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We performed probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess robustness of these outcomes. Scenario analyses were performed to assess the influence of the availability of effective treatment of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. RESULTS: For willingness to pay values in the range of euro6050/QALY-euro31,000/QALY for men and euro6300/QALY-euro42,000/QALY for women, screening-based checking the electronic medical record for patient characteristics and medical history plus the assessment of symptoms had the highest probability of being cost-effective. For higher willingness-to-pay values, direct echocardiography was the preferred screening strategy. Cost-effectiveness of all screening strategies improved with the increase in effectiveness of treatment for HFpEF. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for HF in older community-dwelling patients with T2DM is cost-effective at the commonly used willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20.000/QALY by checking the electronic medical record for patient characteristics and medical history plus the assessment of symptoms.
