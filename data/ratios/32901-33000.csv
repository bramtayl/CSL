32901,Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of Changes to the Surveillance Intervals in the UK Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the safety and cost-effectiveness of lengthening the time between surveillance ultrasound scans in the UK Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) Screening Programme. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of AAA screening for men aged 65, comparing current surveillance intervals to 6 alternative surveillance interval strategies that lengthened the time between surveillance scans for 1 or more AAA size categories. The model considered clinical events and costs incurred over a 30-year time horizon and the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The model adopted the National Health Service perspective and discounted future costs and benefits at 3.5%. RESULTS: Compared with current practice, alternative surveillance strategies resulted in up to a 4% reduction in the number of elective AAA repairs but with an increase of up to 1.6% in the number of AAA ruptures and AAA-related deaths. Alternative strategies resulted in a small reduction in QALYs compared to current practice but with reduced costs. Two strategies that lengthened surveillance intervals in only very small AAAs (3.0-3.9 cm) provided, at a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20?000 per QALY, the highest positive incremental net benefit. There was negligible chance that current practice is the most cost-effective strategy at any threshold below £40?000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Lengthening surveillance intervals in the UK Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Screening Programme, especially for small AAA, can marginally reduce the incremental cost per QALY of the program.

32907,Cost-effectiveness of using hepatitis C viremic hearts for transplantation into HCV-negative recipients,"Outcomes following hepatitis C virus (HCV)-viremic heart transplantation into HCV-negative recipients with HCV treatment are good. We assessed cost-effectiveness between cohorts of transplant recipients willing and unwilling to receive HCV-viremic hearts. Markov model simulated long-term outcomes among HCV-negative patients on the transplant waitlist. We compared costs (2018 USD) and health outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years, QALYs) between cohorts willing to accept any heart and those willing to accept only HCV-negative hearts. We assumed 4.9% HCV-viremic donor prevalence. Patients receiving HCV-viremic hearts were treated, assuming $39 600/treatment with 95% cure. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were compared to a $100 000/QALY gained willingness-to-pay threshold. Sensitivity analyses included stratification by blood type or region and potential negative consequences of receipt of HCV-viremic hearts. Compared to accepting only HCV-negative hearts, accepting any heart gained 0.14 life-years and 0.11 QALYs, while increasing costs by $9418/patient. Accepting any heart was cost effective (ICER $85 602/QALY gained). Results were robust to all transplant regions and blood types, except type AB. Accepting any heart remained cost effective provided posttransplant mortality and costs among those receiving HCV-viremic hearts were not >7% higher compared to HCV-negative hearts. Willingness to accept HCV-viremic hearts for transplantation into HCV-negative recipients is cost effective and improves clinical outcomes.",2021-01-34527,32777173,Am J Transplant,Cathy Logan,2021,21 / 2,657-668,No,32777173,"Cathy Logan; Ily Yumul; Javier Cepeda; Victor Pretorius; Eric Adler; Saima Aslam; Natasha K Martin; Cost-effectiveness of using hepatitis C viremic hearts for transplantation into HCV-negative recipients, Am J Transplant, 2021 Feb; 21(2):1600-6135; 657-668",QALY,United States of America,"Viral hepatitis, Other forms of heart disease",Pharmaceutical,heart transplantation with hepatitis c virus-viremic or negative heart vs. heart transplantation with hepatitis c virus negative heart,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,94180,United States,2018,101629.8
32922,Cost-effectiveness of scaling up short course preventive therapy for tuberculosis among children across 12 countries,"BACKGROUND: While household contact investigation is widely recommended as a means to reduce the burden of tuberculosis (TB) among children, only 27% of eligible pediatric household contacts globally received preventive treatment in 2018. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of household contact investigation for TB treatment and short-course preventive therapy provision for children under 15 years old across 12 high TB burden countries. METHODS: We used decision analysis to compare the costs and estimated effectiveness of three intervention scenarios: (a) status quo (existing levels of coverage with isoniazid preventive therapy), (b) contact investigation with treatment of active TB but no additional preventive therapy, and (c) contact investigation with TB treatment and provision of short-course preventive therapy. Using country-specific demographic, epidemiological and cost data from the literature, we estimated annual costs (in 2018 USD) and the number of TB cases and deaths averted across 12 countries. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were assessed as cost per death and per disability-adjusted life year [DALY] averted. FINDINGS: Our model estimates that contact investigation with treatment of active TB and provision of preventive therapy could be highly cost-effective compared to the status quo (ranging from $100 per DALY averted in Malawi to $1,600 in Brazil; weighted average $383 per DALY averted [uncertainty range: $248 - $1,130]) and preferred to contact investigation without preventive therapy (weighted average $751 per DALY averted [uncertainty range: $250 - $1,306]). Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were TB prevalence, sensitivity of TB diagnosis, case fatality for untreated TB, and cost of household screening. INTERPRETATION: Based on this modeling analysis of available published data, household contact investigation with provision of short-course preventive therapy for TB has a value-for-money profile that compares favorably with other interventions.

METHODS: We used decision analysis to compare the costs and estimated effectiveness of three intervention scenarios: (a) status quo (existing levels of coverage with isoniazid preventive therapy), (b) contact investigation with treatment of active TB but no additional preventive therapy, and (c) contact investigation with TB treatment and provision of short-course preventive therapy. Using country-specific demographic, epidemiological and cost data from the literature, we estimated annual costs (in 2018 USD) and the number of TB cases and deaths averted across 12 countries. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were assessed as cost per death and per disability-adjusted life year [DALY] averted. FINDINGS: Our model estimates that contact investigation with treatment of active TB and provision of preventive therapy could be highly cost-effective compared to the status quo (ranging from $100 per DALY averted in Malawi to $1,600 in Brazil; weighted average $383 per DALY averted [uncertainty range: $248 - $1,130]) and preferred to contact investigation without preventive therapy (weighted average $751 per DALY averted [uncertainty range: $250 - $1,306]). Key drivers of cost-effectiveness were TB prevalence, sensitivity of TB diagnosis, case fatality for untreated TB, and cost of household screening. INTERPRETATION: Based on this modeling analysis of available published data, household contact investigation with provision of short-course preventive therapy for TB has a value-for-money profile that compares favorably with other interventions.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of household contact investigation for TB treatment and short-course preventive therapy provision for children under 15 years old across 12 high TB burden countries. METHODS: We used decision analysis to compare the costs and estimated effectiveness of three intervention scenarios: (a) status quo (existing levels of coverage with isoniazid preventive therapy), (b) contact investigation with treatment of active TB but no additional preventive therapy, and (c) contact investigation with TB treatment and provision of short-course preventive therapy. Using country-specific demographic, epidemiological and cost data from the literature, we estimated annual costs (in 2018 USD) and the number of TB cases and deaths averted across 12 countries. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were assessed as cost per death and per disability-adjusted life year [DALY] averted. FINDINGS: Our model estimates that contact investigation with treatment of active TB and provision of preventive therapy could be highly cost-effective compared to the status quo (ranging from $100 per DALY averted in Malawi to $1,600 in Brazil; weighted average $383 per DALY averted [uncertainty range: $248 - $1,130]) and preferred to contact investigation without preventive therapy (weighted average $751 per DALY averted [uncertainty range: $250 - $1,306]).

32953,"Cost-effectiveness of district-wide seasonal malaria chemoprevention when implemented through routine malaria control programme in Kita, Mali using fixed point distribution","BACKGROUND: Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is a strategy for malaria control recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2012 for Sahelian countries. The Mali National Malaria Control Programme adopted a plan for pilot implementation and nationwide scale-up by 2016. Given that SMC is a relatively new approach, there is an urgent need to assess the costs and cost effectiveness of SMC when implemented through the routine health system to inform decisions on resource allocation. METHODS: Cost data were collected from pilot implementation of SMC in Kita district, which targeted 77,497 children aged 3-59 months. Starting in August 2014, SMC was delivered by fixed point distribution in villages with the first dose observed each month. Treatment consisted of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine and amodiaquine once a month for four consecutive months, or rounds. Economic and financial costs were collected from the provider perspective using an ingredients approach. Effectiveness estimates were based upon a published mathematical transmission model calibrated to local epidemiology, rainfall patterns and scale-up of interventions. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were calculated for the cost per malaria episode averted, cost per disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted, and cost per death averted. RESULTS: The total economic cost of the intervention in the district of Kita was US $357,494. Drug costs and personnel costs accounted for 34% and 31%, respectively. Incentives (payment other than salary for efforts beyond routine activities) accounted for 25% of total implementation costs. Average financial and economic unit costs per child per round were US $0.73 and US $0.86, respectively; total annual financial and economic costs per child receiving SMC were US $2.92 and US $3.43, respectively. Accounting for coverage, the economic cost per child fully adherent (receiving all four rounds) was US $6.38 and US $4.69, if weighted highly adherent, (receiving 3 or 4 rounds of SMC). When costs were combined with modelled effects, the economic cost per malaria episode averted in children was US $4.26 (uncertainty bound 2.83-7.17), US $144 (135-153) per DALY averted and US $ 14,503 (13,604-15,402) per death averted. CONCLUSIONS: When implemented at fixed point distribution through the routine health system in Mali, SMC was highly cost-effective.

32957,"Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination strategies among people who inject drugs (PWID) in Tijuana, Mexico","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In Latin America, Mexico was first to launch a hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination strategy, where people who inject drugs (PWID) are a main risk group for transmission. In Tijuana, HCV seroprevalence among PWID is >90% with minimal harm reduction (HR). We evaluated cost-effectiveness of strategies to achieve the incidence elimination target among PWID in Tijuana. METHODS: Modelling study using a dynamic, cost-effectiveness model of HCV transmission and progression among active and former PWID in Tijuana, to assess the cost-effectiveness of incidence elimination strategies from a healthcare provider perspective. The model incorporated PWID transitions between HR stages (no HR, only opioid agonist therapy, only high coverage needle-syringe programs, both). Four strategies that could achieve the incidence target (80% reduction by 2030) were compared with status quo (no intervention). The strategies incorporated the number of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments required with: 1) no HR scale-up, 2) HR scale-up from 2019 to 20% coverage among PWID, 3) HR to 40% coverage 4) HR to 50% coverage. Costs (2019 US$) and health outcomes (disability-adjusted life years [DALYs]) were discounted 3%/year. Mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ([ICER] $/DALY averted) were compared with one-time per capita GDP ($9,698 in 2019) and purchasing power parity-adjusted per capita GDP ($4,842-13,557) willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. RESULTS: DAAs alone were the least costly elimination strategy ($173M [95%CI 126M-238M]) but accrued fewer health benefits compared with strategies with HR. DAAs+50% HR coverage among PWID averted the most DALYs, but cost $265M [95%CI 210M-335M].

In Tijuana, HCV seroprevalence among PWID is >90% with minimal harm reduction (HR). We evaluated cost-effectiveness of strategies to achieve the incidence elimination target among PWID in Tijuana. METHODS: Modelling study using a dynamic, cost-effectiveness model of HCV transmission and progression among active and former PWID in Tijuana, to assess the cost-effectiveness of incidence elimination strategies from a healthcare provider perspective. The model incorporated PWID transitions between HR stages (no HR, only opioid agonist therapy, only high coverage needle-syringe programs, both). Four strategies that could achieve the incidence target (80% reduction by 2030) were compared with status quo (no intervention). The strategies incorporated the number of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatments required with: 1) no HR scale-up, 2) HR scale-up from 2019 to 20% coverage among PWID, 3) HR to 40% coverage 4) HR to 50% coverage.

32961,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the 2019 cigarette excise tax reform in the Philippines,"In this past decade alone, the Philippines has made major strides in increasing the price of cigarettes.

32963,Promoting the integrated community case management of pneumonia in children under 5 years in Nigeria through the proprietary and patent medicine vendors: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: While evidence-based recommendations for the management pneumonia in under-5-year-olds at the community level with amoxicillin dispersible tablets (DT) were made by the World Health Organisation, initiatives to promote the integrated community case management (iCCM) of pneumonia through the proprietary and patent medicine vendors (PPMVs) have been poorly utilized in Nigeria, possibly due to low financial support and perceived benefit. This study provides costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness estimates and implications of promoting the iCCM through the PPMVs'' education and support. The outcome of this study will help inform healthcare decisions in Nigeria. METHODS: This study was a cost-effectiveness analysis using a simulation-based Markov model. Two approaches were compared, the ''no promotion'' and the ''promotion'' scenarios. The health outcomes include disability-adjusted life years averted and severe pneumonia hospitalisation cost averted. The costs were expressed in 2019 US dollars. RESULTS: The promotion of iCCM through the PPMVs was very cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$143.77 (95% CI US$137.42-150.50)/DALY averted. The promotion will prevent 28,359 cases of severe pneumonia hospitalisation with an estimated healthcare cost of US$390,578. It will also avert 900 deaths in a year. CONCLUSION: Promoting the iCCM for the treatment of pneumonia in children under 5 years through education and support of the PPMVs holds promise to harness the benefits of amoxicillin DT and provide a high return on investment.

32964,Cost-effectiveness of a mobile technology-enabled primary care intervention for cardiovascular disease risk management in rural Indonesia,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death in Indonesia, and there are large disparities in access to recommended preventative treatments across the country, particularly in rural areas. Technology-enabled screening and management led by community health workers have been shown to be effective in better managing those at high risk of CVD in a rural Indonesian population; however, the economic impacts of implementing such an intervention are unknown. We conducted a modelled cost-effectiveness analysis of the SMARThealth intervention in rural villages of Malang district, Indonesia from the payer perspective over a 10-year period. A Markov model was designed and populated with epidemiological and cost data collected in a recent quasi-randomized trial, with nine health states representing a differing risk for experiencing a major CVD event. Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were estimated for the intervention and usual care using disability weights from the literature for major CVD events. Annual treatment costs for CVD treatment and prevention were $US83 under current care and $US144 for those receiving the intervention. The intervention had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $4288 per DALY averted and $3681 per major CVD event avoided relative to usual care. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the results were robust to plausible variations in model parameters and that the intervention is highly likely to be considered cost-effective by decision-makers across a range of potentially acceptable willingness to pay levels. Relative to current care, the intervention was a cost-effective means to improve the management of CVD in this rural Indonesian population. Further scale-up of the intervention offers the prospect of significant gains in population health and sustainable progress toward universal health coverage for the Indonesian population.",2021-01-35950,33712844,Health Policy Plan,Blake Angell,2021,/,,No,33712844,"Blake Angell; Thomas Lung; Devarsetty Praveen; Asri Maharani; Sujarwoto Sujarwoto; Anna Palagyi; Delvac Oceandy; Gindo Tampubolon; Anushka Patel; Stephen Jan; Cost-effectiveness of a mobile technology-enabled primary care intervention for cardiovascular disease risk management in rural Indonesia, Health Policy Plan, 2021 Mar 13; ():0268-1080",DALY,Indonesia,Other forms of heart disease,"Care Delivery, Medical Device, Screening",Technology-enabled screening and management led by community health workers vs. Current practice,High-risk for cardiovascular disease,Not Stated,40 Years,"Male, Female",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-6019,United States,2018,-6495.11
32965,Cost-effectiveness of community health systems strengthening: quality improvement interventions at community level to realise maternal and child health gains in Kenya,"INTRODUCTION: Improvements in maternal and infant health outcomes are policy priorities in Kenya. Achieving these outcomes depends on early identification of pregnancy and quality of primary healthcare. Quality improvement interventions have been shown to contribute to increases in identification, referral and follow-up of pregnant women by community health workers. In this study, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using quality improvement at community level to reduce maternal and infant mortality in Kenya. METHODS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of quality improvement compared with standard of care treatment for antenatal and delivering mothers using a decision tree model and taking a health system perspective. We used both process (antenatal initiation in first trimester and skilled delivery) and health outcomes (maternal and infant deaths averted, as well as disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) as our effectiveness measures and actual implementation costs, discounting costs only. We conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: We found that the community quality improvement intervention was more cost-effective compared with standard community healthcare, with incremental cost per DALY averted of $249 under the deterministic analysis and 76% likelihood of cost-effectiveness under the probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a standard threshold. The deterministic estimate of incremental cost per additional skilled delivery was US$10, per additional early antenatal care presentation US$155, per maternal death averted US$5654 and per infant death averted US$37 536 (2017 dollars). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows that the community quality improvement intervention was cost-effective compared with the standard community healthcare in Kenya due to improvements in antenatal care uptake and skilled delivery. It is likely that quality improvement interventions are a good investment and may also yield benefits in other health areas.",2021-01-36007,33658302,BMJ Glob Health,Meghan Bruce Kumar,2021,6 / 3,,No,33658302,"Meghan Bruce Kumar; Jason J Madan; Peter Auguste; Miriam Taegtmeyer; Lilian Otiso; Christian B Ochieng; Nelly Muturi; Elizabeth Mgamb; Edwine Barasa; Cost-effectiveness of community health systems strengthening: quality improvement interventions at community level to realise maternal and child health gains in Kenya, BMJ Glob Health, 2021 Mar; 6(3):2059-7908",DALY,Kenya,Persons encountering health services in circumstances related to reproduction,Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care,Quality improvement program for maternal health vs. Status quo,Not Stated,Not Stated,0 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,Not Stated,-270.9,United States,2017,-299.47
32966,Modeling the cost-effectiveness of maternal acellular pertussis immunization (aP) in different socioeconomic settings: A dynamic transmission model of pertussis in three Brazilian states,"OBJECTIVES: Using dynamic transmission models we evaluated the health and cost outcomes of adding acellular pertussis (aP) vaccination of pregnant women to infant vaccination in three Brazilian states that represent different socioeconomic conditions. The primary objective was to determine whether the same model structure could be used to represent pertussis disease dynamics in differing socioeconomic conditions. METHODS: We tested three model structures (SIR, SIRS, SIRSIs) to represent population-level transmission in three socio-demographically distinct Brazilian states: São Paulo, Paraná and Bahia. Two strategies were evaluated: infant wP vaccination alone versus maternal aP immunization plus infant wP vaccination. Model projections for 2014-2029 include outpatient and inpatient pertussis cases, pertussis deaths, years of life lost, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost, and costs (in 2014 USD) of maternal aP vaccination, infant vaccination, and pertussis medical treatment. Incremental cost per DALY averted is presented from the perspective of the Brazilian National Health System. RESULTS: Based on goodness-of-fit statistics, the SIRSIs model fit best, although it had only a modest improvement in statistical quantitative assessments relative to the SIRS model. For all three Brazilian states, maternal aP immunization led to higher costs but also saved infant lives and averted DALYs. The 2014 USD cost/DALY averted was $3068 in Sao Paulo, $2962 in Parana, and $2022 in Bahia. These results were robust in sensitivity analyses with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding per capita gross regional product only when the probability that a pertussis case is reported was assumed higher than base case implying more overt cases and deaths and therefore more medical costs.

The cost implications of their efficacy and accuracy are not well established. PURPOSE: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of quantitative European Association for Study of the Liver (qEASL) compared with Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and modified RECIST (mRECIST) response criteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed, accounting for both costs and outcomes from a payor perspective. Three different tumor imaging response criteria were evaluated: (1) qEASL, (2) RECIST, and (3) mRECIST. Input parameters were derived from the most comprehensive literature available focusing on the assessment of liver tumor response after transarterial chemoembolization. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Base case calculation showed qEASL to be the dominant strategy, with the highest effectiveness (1.06 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), as compared with 1.05 QALY in mRECIST and 1.02 QALY in RECIST). The expected costs of qEASL, mRECIST, and RECIST were $451,773, $460,489, and $459,004, respectively. qEASL was more cost-effective than RECIST in 71.50% of the 10,000 iterations and mRECIST in 69.26% of the iterations. One-way sensitivity analysis varying the cost showed that qEASL remained cost-effective until its additional cost was above $9,994.

CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates qEASL to be the most cost-effective tumor response assessment criterion, with substantial cost savings as compared with RECIST and mRECIST for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma after transarterial chemoembolization.",2021-01-34867,33484726,J Am Coll Radiol,Xiao Wu,2021,/,,No,33484726,"Xiao Wu; Julius Chapiro; Ajay Malhotra; Cost-Effectiveness of Imaging Tumor Response Criteria in Hepatocellular Cancer After Transarterial Chemoembolization, J Am Coll Radiol, 2021 Jan 20; ():1546-1440",QALY,United States of America,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Other,quantitative European Association for Study of the Liver vs. modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors,"Intermediate hepatocellular cancer, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage B",Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,-180775,United States,2020,-189267.85
32971,Cost Comparison of Botulinum Toxin Injections Versus Surgical Treatment in Pediatric Patients With Cerebral Palsy: A Markov Model,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of surgical release to botulinum toxin injections in the treatment of upper-extremity (UE) cerebral palsy (CP). METHODS: A Markov transition-state model was developed to assess the direct and indirect costs as well as accumulated quality-adjusted life-years associated with surgery (surgery group) and continuous botulinum toxin injections (botulinum group) for the treatment of UE CP in children aged 7 to 12 years. Direct medical costs were obtained from institutional billing departments. The number of parental missed workdays associated with each treatment was estimated and previously published regressions were used to calculate indirect costs associated with missed work. Total costs, cost-effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and willingness to pay thresholds were used to make decisions regarding society''s willingness to pay for the incremental cost of each treatment given the incremental benefit. RESULTS: The surgery group demonstrated lower direct, indirect, and total costs compared with the botulinum group. Direct costs were $29,250.50 for the surgery group and $50,596.00 for the botulinum group. Indirect costs were $9,467.46 for the surgery group and $44,428.60 for the botulinum group. Total costs were $38,717.96 for the surgery group and $95,024.60 for the botulinum group, a difference of $56,306.64. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -$42,019.88, indicating that surgery is a less costly and more effective treatment and that botulinum injections fall outside the societal willingness to pay threshold. Excluding indirect costs associated with parental missed work during home occupational therapy did not have a significant impact on the model. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery is associated with lower direct, indirect, and total costs, as well as a greater number of accumulated quality-adjusted life-years. Surgery provides a greater benefit at a lower cost, which suggests that botulinum injections should be used sparingly in this population. Treatment with surgery could represent savings of $5.6 to $11.3 billion annually in the United States.

32972,The STarT Back stratified care model for nonspecific low back pain: a model-based evaluation of long-term cost-effectiveness,"The STarT Back approach comprises subgrouping patients with low back pain (LBP) according to the risk of persistent LBP-related disability, with appropriate matched treatments. In a 12-month clinical trial and implementation study, this stratified care approach was clinically and cost-effective compared with usual, nonstratified care. Despite the chronic nature of LBP and associated economic burden, model-based economic evaluations in LBP are rare and have shortcomings. This study therefore produces a de novo decision model of this stratified care approach for LBP management to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness and address methodological concerns in LBP modelling. A cost-utility analysis from the National Health Service perspective compared stratified care with usual care in patients consulting in primary care with nonspecific LBP. A Markov state-transition model was constructed where patient prognosis over 10 years was dependent on physical function achieved at 12 months. Data from the clinical trial and implementation study provided short-term model parameters, with extrapolation using 2 cohort studies of usual care in LBP. Base-case results indicate this model of stratified care is cost-effective, delivering 0.14 additional quality-adjusted life years at a cost saving of £135.19 per patient over a time horizon of 10 years. Sensitivity analyses indicate the approach is likely to be cost-effective in all scenarios and cost saving in most. It is likely this stratified care model will help reduce unnecessary healthcare usage while improving the patient''s quality of life. Although decision-analytic modelling is used in many conditions, its use has been underexplored in LBP, and this study also addresses associated methodological challenges.",2021-01-34884,32868748,Pain,James A Hall,2021,162 / 3,702-710,No,32868748,"James A Hall; Sue Jowett; Martyn Lewis; Raymond Oppong; Kika Konstantinou; The STarT Back stratified care model for nonspecific low back pain: a model-based evaluation of long-term cost-effectiveness, Pain, 2021 Mar 1; 162(3):1872-6623; 702-710",QALY,United Kingdom,Dorsopathies,Care Delivery,STarT Back stratified care model vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,-965.64,United Kingdom,2016,-1477.81
32973,Economic evaluation of nurse-led stroke aftercare addressing long-term psychosocial outcome: a comparison to care-as-usual,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of nurse-led stroke aftercare addressing psychosocial outcome at 6?months post stroke, compared with care-as-usual. DESIGN: Economic evaluation within a comparative effectiveness research design. SETTING: Primary care (2016-2017) and community settings (2011-2013) in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Persons who suffered from ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke, or a transient ischaemic attack and were discharged home after visiting the emergency department, hospitalisation or inpatient rehabilitation. INTERVENTIONS: Nurse-led stroke aftercare at 6 months post stroke addressing psychosocial functioning by providing screening, psycho-education, emotional support and referral to specialist care when needed. Care-as-usual concerned routine follow-up care including secondary prevention programmes and a consultation with the neurologist at 6 weeks post stroke. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Main outcome measure of cost-effectiveness was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated by the quality of life measured by the five-dimensional, three-level EuroQol. Costs were assessed using a cost-questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and social participation (Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation) restrictions subscale. RESULTS: Health outcomes were significantly better in stroke aftercare for QALYs (?=0.05; 95%?CI 0.01 to 0.09) and social participation (?=4.91; 95%?CI 1.89 to 7.93) compared with care-as-usual. Total societal costs were €1208 higher in stroke aftercare than in care-as-usual (95%?CI -€3881 to €6057). Healthcare costs were in total €1208 higher in stroke aftercare than in care-as-usual (95%?CI -€3881 to €6057). Average costs of stroke aftercare were €91 (SD=€3.20) per person. Base case cost-effectiveness analyses showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of €24 679 per QALY gained. Probability of stroke aftercare being cost-effective was 64% on a €50 000 willingness-to-pay level. CONCLUSIONS: Nurse-led stroke aftercare addressing psychosocial functioning showed to be a low-cost intervention and is likely to be a cost-effective addition to care-as-usual.

32974,Herpes Simplex Virus Serotyping in Pregnant Women With a History of Genital Herpes and an Outbreak in the Third Trimester of Pregnancy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether serotyping women with a history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) and an outbreak during the third trimester of pregnancy is cost effective compared with no serotyping. METHODS: We designed a decision-analytic model using TreeAge Pro software to assess an approach of routine HSV serotyping in a theoretical cohort of 63,582 women (an estimate of the number of women in the United States with a history of genital HSV and an outbreak during the third trimester of pregnancy). Outcomes included mild, moderate, and severe neonatal HSV, neonatal death, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for both the woman and neonate. Probabilities, utilities, and costs were derived from the literature, and we used a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In our theoretical cohort, HSV serology screening resulted in 519, 8, and 15 cases of mild, moderate, and severe neonatal HSV, whereas no serology screening resulted in 745, 65, and 85 cases, respectively. Thus, HSV serology screening led to 226, 57, and 70 fewer cases of mild, moderate, and severe neonatal HSV, respectively, as well as 91 fewer neonatal deaths. Additionally, serology screening saved $61 million and gained 7,900 QALYs, making it a dominant strategy. Univariate sensitivity analysis demonstrated that serology screening was cost effective until the chance of progression from neonatal HSV infection to disease despite empiric antiviral treatment was greater than 23%. CONCLUSION: Serology screening in pregnant women with an outbreak in the third trimester of pregnancy and a history of genital HSV resulted in improved outcomes and decreased costs.",2021-01-34893,33278294,Obstet Gynecol,Isabelle C Chatroux,2021,137 / 1,63-71,No,33278294,"Isabelle C Chatroux; Alyssa R Hersh; Aaron B Caughey; Herpes Simplex Virus Serotyping in Pregnant Women With a History of Genital Herpes and an Outbreak in the Third Trimester of Pregnancy: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Obstet Gynecol, 2021 Jan 1; 137(1):0029-7844; 63-71",QALY,United States of America,Infections with a predominantly sexual mode of transmission,Screening,herpes simplex virus serology screening vs. no serology screening,"outbreak of herpes in third trimester of pregnancy, history of genital herpes",Not Stated,18 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-772151.9,United States,2019,-818401.22
32975,Cost-effectiveness of a reactive oral cholera immunization campaign using Shanchol™ in Malawi,"BACKGROUND: Oral cholera vaccines (OCV) have been recommended as additional measures for the prevention of cholera. However, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of OCV use in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in reactive outbreak contexts. This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the use of OCV Shanchol in response to a cholera outbreak in the Lake Chilwa area, Malawi. METHODS: The Excel-based Vaccine Introduction Cost-Effectiveness model was used to assess the cost-effectiveness ratios with and without indirect protection. Model input parameters were obtained from cost evaluations and epidemiological studies conducted in Malawi and published literature. One-way sensitivity and threshold analyses of cost-effectiveness ratios were performed. RESULTS: Compared with the reference scenario i.e. treatment of cholera cases, the immunization campaign would have prevented 636 and 1 020 cases of cholera without and with indirect protection, respectively. The cost-effectiveness ratios were US$19 212 per death, US$500 per case, and US$738 per DALY averted without indirect protection. They were US$10 165 per death, US$264 per case, and US$391 per DALY averted with indirect protection. The net cost per DALY averted was sensitive to four input parameters, including case fatality rate, duration of immunity (vaccine''s protective duration), discount rate and cholera incidence. CONCLUSION: Relative to the Malawi gross domestic product per capita, the reactive OCV campaign represented a cost-effective intervention, particularly when considering indirect vaccine effects.

32979,A Study Comparing Cost-Effectiveness of Combination Therapy for Preventing Opportunistic Infections Among Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Adults on Antiretroviral Therapy,"OBJECTIVES: India is going through an epidemiologic and demographic transition made possible by increased investment in health sector and sustained development. The country has more than 2 million people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Information on cost-effectiveness of competing interventions is a useful contributor to decisions concerning allocation and prioritization of healthcare resources. This paper aims to study the cost, health outcomes as measured by disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), and cost-effectiveness per DALY averted of prophylaxis for tuberculosis, diarrhea, and mouth ulcers in HIV-infected adults. METHODS: Data were analyzed on 375 HIV-infected persons enrolled at the ART Centre in New Delhi between April 2004 and April 2006. Using estimates of the age of onset of HIV infection, cost of medicines, and antiretroviral regimen followed, we used standard methods to calculate the cost per DALY as a measure of cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the robustness of cost-effectiveness results by making reasonable changes in underlying assumptions. RESULTS: The results revealed that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for tuberculosis prophylaxis was ?4821.48 ($78.86) per DALY averted compared with no prophylaxis, followed by diarrhea (?8299.08, $135.74) and mouth ulcers (?20?058.14, $328.07). CONCLUSIONS: The estimates are less than the per capita gross domestic product of India, indicating that the current treatments are highly cost-effective.

32982,The Cost-Effectiveness of Palliative Care: Insights from the PAL-HF Trial,"CONTEXT: In a randomized control trial, Palliative Care in Heart Failure (PAL-HF) improved heart failure (HF) related quality of life, though cost-effectiveness remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the PAL-HF trial, which provided outpatient palliative care to patients with advanced heart failure. METHODS: Outcomes for Usual care and PAL-HF strategies were compared using a Markov cohort model over 36 months from the payer perspective. The model parameters were informed by PAL-HF trial data and supplemented with meta-analyses and Medicare administrative data. Outcomes included hospitalization, place of death, Medicare expenditures, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). RESULTS: Simulated mortality rates were the same for PAL-HF and Usual Care cohorts, at 89.7% at 36 months. In base case analysis, the PAL-HF intervention resulted in an incremental gain of 0.03 QALYs and an incremental cost of $964 per patient for an ICER of $29,041 per QALY. In one-way sensitivity analyses, an intervention cost of up to $140 per month is cost-effective at $50,000 per QALY. Of 1000 simulations, the PC intervention had a 66.1% probability of being cost-effective at $50,000 willingness-to-pay threshold assuming no reduction in hospitalization. In a scenario analysis, PAL-HF reduced payer spending through reductions in non-CV hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: These results from this single center trial are encouraging that palliative care for advanced heart failure is an economically attractive intervention. Confirmation of these findings in larger multicenter trials will be an important part of developing the evidence to support more widespread implementation of the PAL-HF palliative care intervention.",2021-01-34536,33731305,J Card Fail,Brystana G Kaufman,2021,/,,No,33731305,"Brystana G Kaufman; Bradi B Granger; Jie-Lena Sun; Gillian Sanders; Donald H Jr Taylor; Daniel B Mark; Haider Warraich; Mona Fiuzat; Karen Steinhauser; James A Tulsky; Joseph G Rogers; Christopher O'Connor; Robert J Mentz; Li Ma; Yuying Wang; Xiaohong Gao; Yi Dai; Yu Zhang; Zhaojing Wang; Xiaoxia Wang; Limin Wang; Jing Jiang; Xinhua Jing; Chunxia Yang; Fanghui Zhao; Jinghe Lang; Youlin Qiao; The Cost-Effectiveness of Palliative Care: Insights from the PAL-HF Trial, J Card Fail, 2021 Mar 14; ():1532-8414",QALY,United States of America,Other forms of heart disease,Care Delivery,multidisciplinary outpatient palliative care + usual care vs. usual care for heart failure,discharged after hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,29041,United States,2018,31338.19
32983,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nonoperative Management Versus Early Drilling for Stable Osteochondritis Dissecans Lesions of the Knee in Skeletally Immature Patients,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a trial of nonoperative management versus early drilling in the treatment of skeletally immature patients with stable osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee. METHODS: A decision tree model was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of a trial of nonoperative management versus early drilling (within 6 weeks of the first office visit) from payer and societal perspectives over a 3-year time horizon. Relevant transition probabilities, costs (in 2019 US dollars based on Medicare reimbursement), health state utilities, and times to healing were derived from the literature. The principal outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). One- and 2-way sensitivity analyses were performed on pertinent model parameters to validate the robustness of the base-case results using a conservative willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards checklist for reporting economic evaluations was used. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis from a payer perspective, early drilling was more effective (2.51 versus 2.27 QALYs), more costly ($4,655 versus $3,212), and overall more cost-effective (ICER $5,839/QALY) relative to nonoperative management. In the base-case analysis from a societal perspective, early drilling dominated nonoperative management owing to its increased effectiveness (2.51 versus 2.27 QALYs) and decreased cost ($13,098 versus $18,149). These results were stable across broad ranges on sensitivity analysis. Based on 1-way threshold analyses from a payer perspective, early drilling remained cost-effective as long it cost less than $19,840, the disutility of surgery was greater than -0.40, or the probability of successful early drilling was greater than 0.62.

32985,A Self-Help App for Syrian Refugees With Posttraumatic Stress (Sanadak): Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Syrian refugees residing in Germany often develop posttraumatic stress as a result of the Syrian civil war, their escape, and postmigration stressors. At the same time, there is a lack of adequate treatment options. The smartphone-based app Sanadak was developed to provide cognitive behavioral therapy-based self-help in the Arabic language for Syrian refugees with posttraumatic stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the app. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, eligible individuals were randomly allocated to the intervention group (IG; app use) or control group (CG; psychoeducational reading material). Data were collected during structured face-to-face interviews at 3 assessments (preintervention/baseline, postintervention/after 4 weeks, follow-up/after 4 months). Using adjusted mixed-effects linear regression models, changes in posttraumatic stress and secondary outcomes were investigated as intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated based on adjusted mean total costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves using the net benefit approach. RESULTS: Of 170 screened individuals (aged 18 to 65 years), 133 were eligible and randomized to the IG (n=65) and CG (n=68). Although there was a pre-post reduction in posttraumatic stress, ITT showed no significant differences between the IG and CG after 4 weeks (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale for DSM-5, Diff -0.90, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.47; P=.52) and after 4 months (Diff -0.39, 95% CI -3.24 to 2.46; P=.79). The same was true for PP. Regarding secondary outcomes, ITT indicated a treatment effect for self-stigma: after 4 weeks (Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale/SSMIS-stereotype agreement: d=0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.25; stereotype application: d=0.60, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.99) and after 4 months (d=0.52, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.92; d=0.50, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.90), the IG showed significantly lower values in self-stigma than the CG. ITT showed no significant group differences in total costs and QALYs. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 81% for a willingness-to-pay of €0 per additional QALY but decreased with increasing willingness-to-pay. CONCLUSIONS: Sanadak was not more effective in reducing mild to moderate posttraumatic stress in Syrian refugees than the control condition nor was it likely to be cost-effective. Therefore, Sanadak is not suitable as a standalone treatment. However, as the app usability was very good, no harms detected, and stigma significantly reduced, Sanadak has potential as a bridging aid within a stepped and collaborative care approach.

32995,Cost-Utility Analysis of a Complex Intervention to Reduce School-Based Bullying and Aggression: An Analysis of the Inclusive RCT,"OBJECTIVES: Bullying and aggression among children and young people are key public mental health priorities. In this study, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a complex school-based intervention to address these outcomes within a large-cluster randomized trial (Inclusive). METHODS: Forty state secondary schools were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive the intervention or continue with current practice as controls. Data were collected using paper questionnaires completed in classrooms including measures of their health-related quality of life using the Childhood Utility Index and police and National Health Service resource use. Further detailed data were collected on the cost of delivering the intervention. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios following the intention-to-treat principle using multilevel linear regression models that allowed for clustering of pupils at the school level. RESULTS: Overall, we found that the intervention was highly cost-effective, with cost-per quality-adjusted life year thresholds of £13?284 and £1875 at 2 years and 3 years, respectively. Analysis of uncertainty in the result at 2 years revealed a 65% chance of being cost-effective, but after 3 years there was a 90% chance that it was cost-effective. CONCLUSION: This study provides strong evidence collected prospectively from a randomized study that this school-based intervention is highly cost-effective.

32997,Cost-Effectiveness Assessment of Monitoring Abiraterone Levels in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients,"OBJECTIVES: Abiraterone acetate is registered for the treatment of metastatic castration-sensitive and resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Treatment outcome is associated with plasma trough concentrations (C(min)) of abiraterone. Patients with a plasma C(min) below the target of 8.4 ng/mL may benefit from treatment optimization by dose increase or concomitant intake with food. This study aims to investigate the cost-effectiveness of monitoring abiraterone C(min) in patients with mCRPC. METHODS: A Markov model was built with health states progression-free survival, progressed disease, and death. The benefits of monitoring abiraterone C(min) followed by a dose increase or food intervention were modeled via a difference in the percentage of patients achieving adequate C(min) taking a healthcare payer perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess uncertainties and their impac to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Monitoring abiraterone followed by a dose increase resulted in 0.149 incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with €22?145 incremental costs and an ICER of €177?821/QALY. The food intervention assumed equal effects and estimated incremental costs of €7599, resulting in an ICER of €61?019/QALY. The likelihoods of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) with a dose increase or food intervention being cost-effective were 8.04%and 81.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Monitoring abiraterone followed by a dose increase is not cost-effective in patients with mCRPC from a healthcare payer perspective. Monitoring in combination with a food intervention is likely to be cost-effective.

32999,Cost-Effectiveness of Open Versus Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release,"BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common upper-extremity nerve compression syndrome. Over 500,000 carpal tunnel release (CTR) procedures are performed in the U.S. yearly. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic CTR (ECTR) versus open CTR (OCTR) using data from published meta-analyses comparing outcomes for ECTR and OCTR. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to examine the cost-effectiveness of OCTR versus ECTR for patients undergoing unilateral CTR in an office setting under local anesthesia and in an operating-room (OR) setting under monitored anesthesia care. The main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We modeled societal (modeled with a 50-year-old patient) and Medicare payer (modeled with a 65-year-old patient) perspectives, adopting a lifetime time horizon. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs). RESULTS: ECTR resulted in 0.00141 additional QALY compared with OCTR. From a societal perspective, assuming 8.21 fewer days of work missed after ECTR than after OCTR, ECTR cost less across all procedure settings. The results are sensitive to the number of days of work missed following surgery. From a payer perspective, ECTR in the OR (ECTROR) cost $1,872 more than OCTR in the office (OCTRoffice), for an ICER of approximately $1,332,000/QALY. The ECTROR cost $654 more than the OCTROR, for an ICER of $464,000/QALY. The ECTRoffice cost $107 more than the OCTRoffice, for an ICER of $76,000/QALY. From a payer perspective, for a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, OCTRoffice was preferred over ECTROR in 77% of the PSA iterations. From a societal perspective, ECTROR was preferred over OCTRoffice in 61% of the PSA iterations. CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, ECTR is associated with lower costs as a result of an earlier return to work and leads to higher QALYs. Additional research on return to work is needed to confirm these findings on the basis of contemporary return-to-work practices. From a payer perspective, ECTR is more expensive and is cost-effective only if performed in an office setting under local anesthesia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and Decision Analysis Level I.
