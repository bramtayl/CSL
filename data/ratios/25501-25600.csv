25501,"Cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib compared with infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, vedolizumab and ustekinumab for the treatment of moderate to severe ulcerative colitis in Germany","OBJECTIVES: Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC). This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of tofacitinib versus other available treatments for patients with moderate to severe UC following an inadequate response to conventional treatment and who are either naïve to or have failed previous biologics in Germany. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was developed to evaluate the differences in long-term costs and outcomes between tofacitinib and its comparators from the perspective of German statutory health insurance (SHI) for patients either naïve or exposed to biologics. Tofacitinib was compared to infliximab, infliximab biosimilar, adalimumab, adalimumab biosimilar, golimumab, vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and conventional therapy. Health states modeled were remission, treatment response, active UC, and post-colectomy. Patients not responding to treatment could switch to a different treatment. Treatment efficacy for induction and maintenance phases were assessed by a systematic literature review (SLR) and network meta-analysis (NMA). The model included costs associated with drug administration, adverse events, and medical resource use. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSA and PSA) were conducted. RESULTS: Over a life-time horizon, patients treated with tofacitinib gained 0.035-0.083 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and had direct cost savings to the SHI of €4,228-€17,184 compared to biologic treatments other than adalimumab biosimilar. When compared to adalimumab biosimilar, treatment with tofacitinib resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €17,497 per QALY gained and can be considered a cost-effective alternative. Compared with conventional therapy, tofacitinib resulted in a lower ICER than all other biologics. The DSA showed that the model results were most influenced by differences in treatment efficacy.

25506,An economic and disease transmission model of human papillomavirus and oropharyngeal cancer in Texas,"In 2017, 46,157 and 3,127 new oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) cases were reported in the U.S. and Texas, respectively. About 70% of OPC were attributed to human papillomavirus (HPV). However, only 51% of U.S. and 43.5% of Texas adolescents have completed the HPV vaccine series. Therefore, modeling the demographic dynamics and transmission of HPV and OPC progression is needed for accurate estimation of the economic and epidemiological impacts of HPV vaccine in a geographic area. An age-structured population dynamic model was developed for the U.S. state of Texas. With Texas-specific model parameters calibrated, this model described the dynamics of HPV-associated OPC in Texas. Parameters for the Year 2010 were used as the initial values, and the prediction for Year 2012 was compared with the real age-specific incidence rates in 23 age groups for model validation. The validated model was applied to predict 100-year age-adjusted incidence rates. The public health benefits of HPV vaccine uptake were evaluated by computer simulation. Compared with current vaccination program, increasing vaccine uptake rates by 50% would decrease the cumulative cases by 4403, within 100 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy was $94,518 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.

25508,Evaluation of the cost-utility of a prescription digital therapeutic for the treatment of opioid use disorder,"Background: The opioid epidemic continues to generate a significant mental and physical health burden on patients, and claims the life of almost 150 Americans daily. Making matters worse, an increase in relapses and/or opioid-related deaths has been reported in more than 40 U.S. states since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Opioid use disorder (OUD) is one of the single most expensive disorders in the United States, generating average medical costs of $60B from just 2 million Americans diagnosed with the disorder. In commercial use since 2019, reSET-O is a non-drug, prescription digital therapeutic (PDT) that delivers evidence-based neurobehavioral treatment for OUD and helps overcome the barriers associated with access to care, stigma, and social distancing. Although shown to be cost effective and efficacious in clinical trials and real-world evidence studies, respectively, information on its value for money from a health utilities and cost per quality-adjusted life-year is needed to inform policy discussions.Objectives: To evaluate the impact of reSET-O on health utilities and assess its overall cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained vs. treatment-as-usual (TAU).Methods: Decision analytic model comparing reSET-O plus TAU to TAU alone (i.e. buprenorphine, face-to-face counseling, and contingency management) over 12 weeks. Clinical effectiveness data (abstinence and health utility) were obtained from a clinical trial, and resource utilization and cost data were adapted from a recent claims data analysis to reflect less frequent face-to-face counseling with the therapeutic.Results: The addition of reSET-O to TAU decreases total health care costs by -$131 and resulted in post-treatment utility values within population norms, with a corresponding gain of 0.003 QALYs. reSET-O when used adjunctively to TAU was economically dominant (less costly, more effective) vs. TAU alone.Conclusion: reSET-O is an economically-dominant adjunctive treatment for OUD and is associated with an overall reduction in total incremental cost vs TAU.",2021-01-34306,33593201,Postgrad Med,Fulton F Velez,2021,/,1-7,No,33593201,"Fulton F Velez; Hilary F Luderer; Robert Gerwien; Benjamin Parcher; Dylan Mezzio; Daniel C Malone; Evaluation of the cost-utility of a prescription digital therapeutic for the treatment of opioid use disorder, Postgrad Med, 2021 Feb 22; ():1941-9260; 1-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior","prescription digital therapeutic reset-o vs. Standard/Usual Care- buprenorphine, face to face counseling, and contingency management",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-43666.67,United States,2019,-44205.38
25509,"Economic evaluation of 'Men on the Move', a 'real world' community-based physical activity programme for men","BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) interventions capable of producing health benefits cost effectively are a public health priority across the Western world. ''Men on the Move'' (MOM), a community-based PA intervention for men, demonstrated significant health benefits up to 52-weeks (W) post-baseline. This article details the economic evaluation of MOM with a view to determining its cost-effectiveness as a public health intervention to be rolled out nationally in Ireland. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was determined by comparing the costs (direct and indirect) of the programme to its benefits, which were captured as the impact on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). For the benefits, cost-utility analysis was conducted by retrospectively adapting various health-related measures of participants to generate health states using Brazier et al.''s (2002) short form-6D algorithm. This in turn allowed for ''utility measures'' to be generated, from which QALYs were derived. RESULTS: Findings show MOM to be cost-effective in supporting an ''at risk'' cohort of men achieves significant improvements in aerobic fitness, weight loss and waist reduction. The total cost per participant (€125.82 for each of the 501 intervention participants), the QALYs gained (11.98 post-12-W intervention, or 5.3% health improvement per participant) and estimated QALYs ratio costs of €3723 represents a cost-effective improvement when compared to known QALY guidelines.

25510,Cost-effectiveness of Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab vs Sorafenib as First-Line Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"IMPORTANCE: Treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab may prolong overall survival among patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, to our knowledge, the cost-effectiveness of using this high-priced therapy for this indication is currently unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab to treat unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma from the US payer perspective. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation used a partitioned survival model consisting of 3 discrete health states to assess the cost-effectiveness of treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab vs sorafenib. The characteristics of patients in the model were similar to patients in a phase 3, open-label randomized clinical trial (IMbrave150) who had unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and had not previously received systemic treatment. Key clinical data were generated from the IMbrave150 trial conducted between March 15, 2018, and January 30, 2019, and cost and health preference data were collected from the literature. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-utility ratios, incremental net health benefits, and incremental net monetary benefits were calculated for the 2 treatment strategies. Subgroup, 1-way sensitivity, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab added 0.530 QALYs and resulted in an incremental cost of $89?807 compared with sorafenib therapy, which had an incremental cost-utility ratio of $169?223 per QALY gained. The incremental net health benefit was -0.068 QALYs, and the incremental net monetary benefit was -$10?202 at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150?000/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab achieved a 35% probability of cost-effectiveness at a threshold of $150?000/QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the results were most sensitive to the hazard ratio of overall survival. The subgroup analysis found that treatment with atezolizumab plus bevacizumab was associated with preferred incremental net health benefits in several subgroups, including patients with hepatitis B and C. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment is unlikely to be a cost-effective option compared with sorafenib for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Reducing the prices of atezolizumab and bevacizumab may improve cost-effectiveness. The economic outcomes also may be improved by tailoring treatments based on individual patient factors.",2021-01-34310,33625508,JAMA Netw Open,Dan Su,2021,4 / 2,e210037,No,33625508,"Dan Su; Bin Wu; Lizheng Shi; Cost-effectiveness of Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab vs Sorafenib as First-Line Treatment of Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma, JAMA Netw Open, 2021 Feb 1; 4(2):2574-3805; e210037",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,atezolizumab + bevacizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- sorafenib (400 mg) orally twice daily,"advanced, unresectable",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,169223,United States,2019,171310.68
25511,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Ginkgolide Injection in the Treatment of Ischemic Stroke Based on a Randomized Clinical Trial,"Objective: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of ginkgolide plus aspirin compared with placebo plus aspirin treatment of ischemic stroke. Background: Stroke is the leading cause of death and long-term disability in China, with high incidence, high mortality, and heavy disease burden. In addition to Western medicines, Chinese clinical guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke recommend application of Chinese patent medicines. Ginkgolide injection is commonly used in the clinical treatment of stroke in China to promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis. The economy of ginkgolide injection needs to be evaluated. Methods: A Markov model was constructed consisting of four disease states: no significant disability, disability, stroke recurrence, and death. Therapeutic data were taken from the Ginkgolide in Ischemic Stroke Patients with Large Artery Atherosclerosis (GISAA) study. Utilities and transition probabilities were extracted from the literature. Cost data were obtained from the China Health Statistics Yearbook and hospital record survey. Expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of 13 years of cycles (calculated by average age of subjects and Chinese life expectancy) were calculated through TreeAge Pro11 software. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold was set as the Chinese per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019, CN¥70,892/QALY. The results were analyzed by single factor and probability sensitivity analyses. Results: Ginkgolide plus aspirin had a higher expected per-patient cost than placebo plus aspirin but a higher QALYs. Compared with placebo plus aspirin, ginkgolide plus aspirin produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CN¥14,866.06/QALY, which is below the WTP threshold. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested the acceptability of ginkgolide plus aspirin was higher than that of placebo plus aspirin.

25512,Cost-Effectiveness of an Opioid Abuse-Prevention Program Using the Narcotics Information Management System in South Korea,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an opioid abuse-prevention program embedded in the Narcotics Information Management System (""the Network System to Prevent Doctor-Shopping for Narcotics"") in South Korea. METHODS: Using a Markov model with a 1-year cycle length and 30-year time horizon, we estimated the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of implementing an opioid abuse-prevention program in patients prescribed outpatient opioids from a Korean healthcare payer''s perspective. The model has 6 health states: no opioid use, therapeutic opioid use, opioid abuse, overdose, overdose death, and all-cause death. Patient characteristics, healthcare costs, and transition probabilities were estimated from national population-based data and published literature. Age- and sex-specific utilities of the general Korean population were used for the no-use state, whereas the other health-state utilities were obtained from published studies. Costs (in 2019 US dollars) included the expenses of the program, opioids, and overdoses. An annual 5% discount rate was applied to the costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Parameter uncertainties were explored via deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The program was associated with 2.27 fewer overdoses per 100 000 person-years, with an ICUR of $227/QALY. The ICURs were generally robust to parameter changes, although the program''s effect on abuse reduction was the most influential parameter. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the program reached a 100% probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $900/QALY.

25515,Cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative treatments of African gambiense trypanosomiasis in Uganda,"African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, is a tropical disease caused by trypanosome parasites transmitted by tsetse flies. The focus of this paper is on the cost-effectiveness of alternative drug treatments for patients in the late stage of the disease. Melarsoprol has been used for many decades. More recently, eflornithine has been developed. It has fewer side effects and improves the overall cure rate. It is much more expensive than melarsoprol, however. The objective of the present cost-effectiveness is to identify the costs and benefits that would be involved in switching from melarsoprol to eflornithine in the treatment of late stage sleeping sickness. Benefits are expressed in lives saved as well as in disability adjusted life years (DALYs). The analysis is applied to the case of Uganda. The implications for affordability are also considered, by taking account of how the treatment costs would be shared between the national government, donors and patients. The baseline results indicate that melarsoprol treatment is associated with an incremental cost per life and DALY saved of $209 and $8, respectively.

25519,Breastfeeding promotion and priority setting in health,"An increase in exclusive breastfeeding prevalence can substantially reduce mortality and morbidity among infants. In this paper, estimates of the costs and impacts of three breastfeeding promotion programmes, implemented through maternity services in Brazil, Honduras and Mexico, are used to develop cost-effectiveness measures and these are compared with other health interventions. The results show that breastfeeding promotion can be one of the most cost-effective health interventions for preventing cases of diarrhoea, preventing deaths from diarrhoea, and gaining disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). The benefits are substantial over a broad range of programme types. Programmes starting with the removal of formula and medications during delivery are likely to derive a high level of impact per unit of net incremental cost. Cost-effectiveness is lower (but still attractive relative to other interventions) if hospitals already have rooming-in and no bottle-feeds; and the cost-effectiveness improves as programmes become well-established. At an annual cost of about 30 to 40 US cents per birth, programmes starting with formula feeding in nurseries and maternity wards can reduce diarrhoea cases for approximately $0.65 to $1.10 per case prevented, diarrhoea deaths for $100 to $200 per death averted, and reduce the burden of disease for approximately $2 to $4 per DALY. Maternity services that have already eliminated formula can, by investing from $2 to $3 per birth, prevent diarrhoea cases and deaths for $3.50 to $6.75 per case, and $550 to $800 per death respectively, with DALYs gained at $12 to $19 each.",1996-01-02543,10158457,Health Policy Plan,S Horton,1996,11 / 2,156-68,No,10158457,"S Horton; T Sanghvi; M Phillips; J Fiedler; R Perez-Escamilla; C Lutter; A Rivera; A M Segall-Correa; R PerezEscamilla; SM SegallCorrea; Matthew S.

25523,"Cost-effectiveness of improved treatment services for sexually transmitted diseases in preventing HIV-1 infection in Mwanza Region, Tanzania","BACKGROUND: A community-randomised trial was undertaken to assess the impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of averting HIV-1 infection through improved management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) by primary-health-care workers in Mwanza Region, Tanzania. METHODS: The impact of improved treatment services for STDs on HIV-1 incidence was assessed by comparison of six intervention communities with six matched communities. We followed up a random cohort of 12,537 adults aged 15-54 years for 2 years to record incidence of HIV-1 infection. The total and incremental costs of the intervention were estimated (ingredients approach) and used to calculate the total cost per case treated, the incremental cost per HIV-1 infection averted, and the incremental cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved. FINDINGS: During 2 years of follow-up, 11,632 cases of STDs were treated in the intervention health units. The baseline prevalence of HIV-1 infection was 4%. The incidence of HIV-1 infection during the 2 years was 1.16% in the intervention communities and 1.86% in the comparison communities. An estimated 252 HIV-1 infections were averted each year. The total annual cost of the intervention was US$59,060 (1993 prices), equivalent to $0.39 per head of population served. The cost for STD case treated was $10.15, of which the drug cost was $2.11. The incremental annual cost of the intervention was $54,839, equivalent to $217.62 per HIV-1 infection averted and $10.33 per DALY saved (based on Tanzanian life expectancy) or $9.45 per DALY saved (based on the assumptions of the World Development Report). In a sensitivity analysis of factors influencing cost-effectiveness, cost per DALY saved ranged from $2.51 to $47.86. INTERPRETATION: Improved management of STDs in rural health units reduced the incidence of HIV-1 infection in the general population by about 40%. The estimated cost-effectiveness of this intervention ($10 per DALY) compares favourably with that of, for example, childhood immunisation programmes ($12-17 per DALY). Cost-effectiveness should be further improved when the intervention is applied on a larger scale. Resources should be made available for this highly cost-effective HIV control strategy.",1997-01-02524,9428251,Lancet,L Gilson,1997,350 / 9094,1805-9,No,9428251,"L Gilson; R Mkanje; H Grosskurth; F Mosha; J Picard; A Gavyole; J Todd; P Mayaud; R Swai; L Fransen; D Mabey; A Mills; R Hayes; W.

25524,From research to practice: use of short course zidovudine to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission in the context of routine health care in Northern Thailand,"Thailand has made remarkable progress in battling the HIVepidemic, as the decreases in HIV prevalence and changes in sexual behavior attest. Yet, in Phayao, a northern province severely affected by HIV, approximately 280 HIV-infected women, or 5% of all pregnant women, gave birth to an estimated 70 infected children in 1997. As many of these infants die within their first year of life, the infant mortality rate is on the rise after years of decline. The province, however, responded quickly to this crisis. Since July 1997, the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) offers through Phayao's seven public hospitals a short regimen of zidovudine to all consenting HIV-infected women to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the virus. The overall prophylactic coverage for the province reached 68% of all HIV-infected pregnant women in the fourth quarter of 1997, either through the MOPH program or through the North Thailand Perinatal HIV Prevention Trial, the parallel clinical trial conducted by the MOPH and the Ministry of University Affairs. Analysis of the data collected showed that compliance to the intervention was excellent, around 90%. This was achieved at an additional cost of US$ 0.13 per capita per year, affordable even in the context of the economic crisis, and represents less than 1% of public health expenditures in Thailand. The cost per Disability Adjusted Life Years saved is approximately US$35, making it highly cost-effective. In less than a year, the MOPH implemented this program on a large scale in this relatively poor province, with limited external support. Women receive pretest counseling at their first prenatal visit, are offered HIV testing and, if they accept, return for posttest counseling two weeks later. In the case of a positive test result, a confirmation test is performed at the provincial hospital. HIV-infected women are offered zidovudine the 34th week of pregnancy or as soon as possible thereafter. Before starting treatment, the women's hemoglobin, CBC and platelets are measured. Infants begin taking oral zidovudine shortly after birth and continue until they are one week old. Subsequently, health centers regularly follow the infants, and volunteers provide case management of childhood illness, nutrition problem solving, childhood immunizations and home visits. Mothers feed the infants breastmilk substitutes, and women with insufficient income receive the substitutes free of charge. The northern Thailand experience provides important insights into the feasibility of large scale interventions to prevent perinatal HIV, such as the need for the reorganization of the delivery of health care and quality counseling. On the basis of this experience, a simplified schedule of three intervention phases (Screen, Treat and Care), which can be incorporated into routine mother and child health care, is proposed. Follow-up of the child, however, will require more frequent and intensive contact with health care services than usual. At a time when many countries are reevaluating their health care systems, these insights should be considered, so as to additional better the needs of HIV-infected women during pregnancy and beyond.",1998-01-02876,10437936,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,V Thaineua,1998,29 / 3,429-42,No,10437936,"V Thaineua; P Sirinirund; A Tanbanjong; M Lallemant; A Soucat; J L Lamboray; From research to practice: use of short course zidovudine to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission in the context of routine health care in Northern Thailand, Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health, 1998-Sep; 29(3):0125-1562; 429-42",DALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Offer a short regimen of zidovudine to all consenting HIV-infected women to prevention mother-to-child transmission of HIV (at 34 weeks of pregnancy) vs. None,HIV infected pregnant women,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,35,United States,1996,57.73
25525,A reassessment of the cost-effectiveness of water and sanitation interventions in programmes for controlling childhood diarrhoea,"Cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that some water supply and sanitation (WSS) interventions are highly cost-effective for the control of diarrhoea among under-5-year-olds, on a par with oral rehydration therapy.

25541,An assessment of the value of Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine in Asia,"Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis and pneumonia. Although invasive Hib disease has been reduced substantially wherever Hib conjugate vaccines have been introduced into routine childhood immunization schedules, these vaccines are more costly compared with the vaccines routinely used in the Expanded Program for Immunization. Consequently a model was constructed to compare the expected burden of Hib disease with and without a national vaccine program for various Asian countries. Cost of the vaccine program, expected benefits of reduced deaths and savings from prevented disease treatment were assessed for each country based on the model assumptions. Model outcomes were expressed as a net cost, cost per death prevented and cost per disability-adjusted life year for each country and economic stratum. With the assumption of a disease burden of meningitis and pneumonia comparable with that observed in other regions, the model predicts that 668000 cases of Hib pneumonia and 136000 cases of Hib meningitis would occur annually in this cohort resulting in 156000 deaths.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: No intervention was compared with three regimens of twice daily zidovudine and lamivudine: regimen A, starting at 36 weeks of gestation and continuing to 1 week postpartum; regimen B, from intrapartum through 1 week postpartum; and regimen C, intrapartum only. Model inputs were estimated from published and unpublished data. Absolute percentage reductions in HIV transmission extrapolated from zidovudine monotherapy trials were estimated at 12.4, 8.6 and 4.3% for regimens A, B, and C, respectively. Outcome measures were net costs to the public sector health-care system, cost per infection averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) gained. Multiple sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Based on the hypothetical efficacy estimates, regimen C was the most cost-effective. For a cohort of 100 women with 15% HIV prevalence, net costs to the public sector health-care systems were estimated at US$3617 for regimen A, US$ 1667 for regimen B, and US$351 for regimen C. Regimen C had a cost of US$ 1129 per HIV infection averted and a cost of US$60 per DALY. Regimens B and A cost US$2680 and 5134 per infection averted and US$143 and 274 per DALY, respectively. Cost-effectiveness declined rapidly at efficacy below 10% or HIV prevalence below 7%. Results were very sensitive to antiviral drug costs. For example, at 20% of current prices, the cost per DALY for regimen A fell to US$64, and to about US$42 for regimens B and C.

25569,Cost effectiveness of single-dose nevirapine regimen for mothers and babies to decrease vertical HIV-1 transmission in sub-Saharan Africa,"BACKGROUND: Identification of economical interventions to decrease HIV-1 transmission to children is an urgent public-health priority in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the cost effectiveness of the HIVNET 012 nevirapine regimen. METHODS: We assessed cost effectiveness in a hypothetical cohort of 20,000 pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. Our main outcome measures were programme cost, paediatric HIV-1 cases averted, cost per case averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY). We compared HIVNET 012 with other short-course antiretroviral regimens.

We did univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses. FINDINGS: For universal treatment with 30% HIV-1 seroprevalence, the HIVNET 012 regimen would avert 603 cases of HIV-1 in babies, cost US$83,333, and generate 15,862 DALYs. The associated cost-effectiveness ratios were $138 per case averted or $5.25 per DALY. At 15% seroprevalence, the universal treatment option would cost $83,333 and avert 302 cases at $276 per case averted or $10.51 per DALY. For targeted treatment at 30% seroprevalence, HIVNET 012 would cost $141,922 and avert 476 cases at $298 per case averted or $11.29 per DALY. With seroprevalence higher than 3.0% for universal and 4.5% for targeted treatment, the HIVNET 012 regimen was likely to be as cost effective as other public-health interventions.

25574,Cost-effectiveness analysis of humanitarian relief interventions: visceral leishmaniasis treatment in the Sudan,"Spending by aid agencies on emergencies has quadrupled over the last decade, to over US$6 billion. To date, cost-effectiveness has seldom been considered in the prioritization and evaluation of emergency interventions. The sheer volume of resources spent on humanitarian aid and the chronicity of many humanitarian interventions call for more attention to be paid to the issue of 'value for money'. In this paper we present data from a major humanitarian crisis, an epidemic of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in war-torn Sudan. The special circumstances provided us, in retrospect, with unusually accurate data on excess mortality, costs of the intervention and its effects, thus allowing us to express cost-effectiveness as the cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted. The cost-effectiveness ratio, of US$18.40 per DALY (uncertainty range between US$13.53 and US$27.63), places the treatment of VL in Sudan among health interventions considered 'very good value for money' (interventions of less than US$25 per DALY). We discuss the usefulness of this analysis to the internal management of the VL programme, the procurement of funds for the programme, and more generally, to priority setting in humanitarian relief interventions. We feel that in evaluations of emergency interventions attempts could be made more often to perform cost-effectiveness analyses, including the use of DALYs, provided that the outcomes of these analyses are seen in the broad context of the emergency situation and its consequences on the affected population. This paper provides a first contribution to what is hoped to become an international database of cost-effectiveness studies of health interventions during relief operations, which use a comparable measure of health outcome such as the DALY.",1999-01-02492,10351471,Health Policy Plan,A Griekspoor,1999,14 / 1,70-6,No,10351471,"A Griekspoor; E Sondorp; T Vos; Christine M.

25575,Rebound mortality and the cost-effectiveness of malaria control: potential impact of increased mortality in late childhood following the introduction of insecticide treated nets,"The efficacy and relative cost-effectiveness of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) for the control of malaria in children under 5 years of age have recently been demonstrated by several large-scale trials. However, it has been suggested that long-term use of ITNs in areas of high transmission could lead to mortality rebound in later childhood, which would reduce the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, and at the extreme could lead to negative overall effects. A model is presented in which the cost and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) per child aged 1-119 months were estimated for a sub-Saharan African population with and without an ITN intervention. The rebound rate, defined as the percentage increase in age-specific all-cause mortality and malaria specific-morbidity, was varied to estimate the threshold at which the intervention was no longer cost-effective. Rebound was considered over two possible age ranges: 5-9 years and 3-6 years. With mortality and morbidity reductions due to ITNs in children aged 1-59 months and rebound in the 5-9 years age class, one could be reasonably certain that the cost per DALY averted is below $150 up to a rebound rate of 39%. Up to an 84% rebound rate it is highly likely that the intervention will be DALY-averting, that is the DALYs averted by the intervetion outweigh DALYs incurred through rebound effects. These thresholds are sensitive to the age range over which reductions and rebound in morbidity and mortality occur. With reductions confined to children aged 1-35 months and rebound in the 3-6 years age class, the cost per DALY is highly likely to fall below $150 only up to a 2.5% rebound rate, and with a rate in excess of 11% one can no longer be reasonably certain that the intervention is DALY-averting. These rates apply to the whole population. If there is no rebound amongst children who did not comply with the intervention, the actual increases in morbidity and mortality required to reach these thresholds amongst compliers would be much higher. The age range over which rebound occurs is a critical determinant of the thresholds at which one can no longer be reasonably certain that ITNs remain cost-effective in the long term. Based on empirical estimates of age-specific malaria mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, it appears unlikely that this threshold rate would be reached if rebound occurs over the 5-9 years age range. By contrast, if rebound occurs over the ages of 3-6 years, the increase in mortality rates required to reach this threshold falls within the observed range of malaria-specific mortality rates for this age group. It is essential that long-term surveillance is included as part of ITN interventions, with particular attention to the age range over which rebound may occur.",1999-01-02622,10223212,Trop Med Int Health,P G Coleman,1999,4 / 3,175-86,No,10223212,"P G Coleman; Jarir Atthobari; Folkert W Asselbergs; Cornelis Boersma; Robin de Vries; Hans L Hillege; Wiek H van Gilst; Ron T Gansevoort; Paul E de Jong; Lolkje T W de Jong-van den Berg; Maarten J Postma; C A Goodman; A Mills; Rebound mortality and the cost-effectiveness of malaria control: potential impact of increased mortality in late childhood following the introduction of insecticide treated nets, Trop Med Int Health, 1999-Mar; 4(3):1360-2276; 175-86",DALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Environmental,Insecticide-treated nets vs. None,Not Stated,11 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,37.9,United States,1995,64.36
25576,The cost effectiveness of strategies for the treatment of intestinal parasites in immigrants,"BACKGROUND: Currently, more than 600,000 immigrants enter the United States each year from countries where intestinal parasites are endemic. At entry persons with parasitic infections may be asymptomatic, and stool examinations are not a sensitive method of screening for parasitosis. Albendazole is a new, broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug, which was approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration. International trials have shown albendazole to be safe and effective in eradicating many parasites. In the United States there is now disagreement about whether to screen all immigrants for parasites, treat all immigrants presumptively, or do nothing unless they have symptoms. METHODS: We compared the costs and benefits of no preventive intervention (watchful waiting) with those of universal screening or presumptive treatment with 400 mg of albendazole per day for five days. Those at risk were defined as immigrants to the United States from Asia, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Cost effectiveness was expressed both in terms of the cost of treatment per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted (one DALY is defined as the loss of one year of healthy life to disease) and in terms of the cost per hospitalization averted. RESULTS: As compared with watchful waiting, presumptive treatment of all immigrants at risk for parasitosis would avert at least 870 DALYs, prevent at least 33 deaths and 374 hospitalizations, and save at least $4.2 million per year. As compared with watchful waiting, screening would cost $159,236 per DALY averted.

25580,The cost effectiveness of strategies for the treatment of intestinal parasites in immigrants,"BACKGROUND: Currently, more than 600,000 immigrants enter the United States each year from countries where intestinal parasites are endemic. At entry persons with parasitic infections may be asymptomatic, and stool examinations are not a sensitive method of screening for parasitosis. Albendazole is a new, broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug, which was approved recently by the Food and Drug Administration. International trials have shown albendazole to be safe and effective in eradicating many parasites. In the United States there is now disagreement about whether to screen all immigrants for parasites, treat all immigrants presumptively, or do nothing unless they have symptoms. METHODS: We compared the costs and benefits of no preventive intervention (watchful waiting) with those of universal screening or presumptive treatment with 400 mg of albendazole per day for five days. Those at risk were defined as immigrants to the United States from Asia, the Middle East, sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, and Latin America and the Caribbean. Cost effectiveness was expressed both in terms of the cost of treatment per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted (one DALY is defined as the loss of one year of healthy life to disease) and in terms of the cost per hospitalization averted. RESULTS: As compared with watchful waiting, presumptive treatment of all immigrants at risk for parasitosis would avert at least 870 DALYs, prevent at least 33 deaths and 374 hospitalizations, and save at least $4.2 million per year.

25595,National and provincial estimated costs and cost effectiveness of a programme to reduce mother-to-child HIV transmission in South Africa,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost and cost effectiveness nationally and for each province of a programme to reduce mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV in South Africa. METHODS: A model developed to estimate cost and cost effectiveness of interventions in Hlabisa, KwaZulu-Natal, was modified and applied to each province. This model predicts a 37% reduction in paediatric HIV infections if short-course oral zidovudine (ZDV) plus infant formula feed for 4 months is provided within a strengthened health system. Estimates of the number of pregnancies and HIV prevalence among pregnant women per province in 1997 were combined with an estimated 30% MTCT rate. Costs were calculated from a health system perspective, and effectiveness was estimated as cost per infection averted and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) gained. RESULTS: In 1997, 63,397 paediatric HIV infections were estimated to have occurred in South Africa, mainly in KwaZulu-Natal (18,513, 29%) and Gauteng (10,417, 16%). The cost of a national programme is estimated at R155.9 million (1997 rand costs, 0.94% of the national health budget). Major cost items are drugs (R46.4 m, 30%), staff salaries (R45.8 m, 29%), and formula feed (R37.1 m, 24%). Most money would need to be spent in KwaZulu-Natal (R37.6 m, 24% of national cost), Gauteng (R25.2 m, 16%) and the Eastern Cape (R24 m, 15%). National cost per infection averted is R6,724, and R213 per DALY gained. Provincial DALY costs range from R176 to R369. CONCLUSIONS: A national programme preventing 37% of expected paediatric HIV infections would cost a small fraction of the national health budget, at a cost equivalent to R3.89 per capita total population. The cost per DALY gained compares well with established public health and clinical interventions in middle-income countries, even without factoring in the care costs that would be saved through a successful programme.

25596,Using epidemiological data to model efficiency in reducing the burden of depression*,"BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease study has suggested that mental disorders are the leading cause of disability burden in the world. This study takes the leading cause of mental disorder burden, depression, and trials an approach for defining the present and optimal efficiency of treatment in an Australian setting. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To examine epidemiological and service use data for depression to trial an approach for modelling (i) the burden that is currently averted from current care, (ii) the burden that is potentially avertable from a hypothetical regime of optimal care, (iii) the efficiency or cost-effectiveness of both current and optimal services for depression and (iv) the potential of current knowledge for reducing burden due to depression, by applying the WHO five-step method for priorities for investment in health research and development. METHODS: Effectiveness and efficiency were calculated in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by adjusting the disability weight for people who received efficacious treatment. Data on service use and treatment outcome were obtained from a variety of secondary sources, including the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, and efficacy of individual treatments from published meta-analyses expressed in effect sizes. Direct costs were estimated from published sources. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of people with depression had had some contact with either primary care or specialist services. Effective coverage of depression was low, with only 32% of cases receiving efficacious treatment that could have lessened their severity (averted disability). In contrast, a proposed model of optimal care for the population management of depression provided increased treatment contacts and a better outcome. In terms of efficiency, optimal care dominated current care, with more health gain for less expenditure (28 632 DALYs were averted at a cost of AUD295 million with optimal care, versus 19 297 DALYs averted at a cost of AUD720 million with current care). However, despite the existence of efficacious technologies for treating depression, only 13% of the burden was averted from present active treatment, primarily because of the low effective coverage. Potentially avertable burden is nearly three times this, if effective treatments can be delivered in appropriate amounts to all those who need it. DISCUSSION: This paper reports a method to calculate the burden currently averted from cross-sectional survey data, and to calculate the burden likely to be averted from an optimal programme estimated from randomized controlled trial data.

25597,Using epidemiological data to model efficiency in reducing the burden of depression*,"BACKGROUND: The Global Burden of Disease study has suggested that mental disorders are the leading cause of disability burden in the world. This study takes the leading cause of mental disorder burden, depression, and trials an approach for defining the present and optimal efficiency of treatment in an Australian setting. AIMS OF THE STUDY: To examine epidemiological and service use data for depression to trial an approach for modelling (i) the burden that is currently averted from current care, (ii) the burden that is potentially avertable from a hypothetical regime of optimal care, (iii) the efficiency or cost-effectiveness of both current and optimal services for depression and (iv) the potential of current knowledge for reducing burden due to depression, by applying the WHO five-step method for priorities for investment in health research and development. METHODS: Effectiveness and efficiency were calculated in disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by adjusting the disability weight for people who received efficacious treatment. Data on service use and treatment outcome were obtained from a variety of secondary sources, including the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing, and efficacy of individual treatments from published meta-analyses expressed in effect sizes. Direct costs were estimated from published sources. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of people with depression had had some contact with either primary care or specialist services. Effective coverage of depression was low, with only 32% of cases receiving efficacious treatment that could have lessened their severity (averted disability). In contrast, a proposed model of optimal care for the population management of depression provided increased treatment contacts and a better outcome. In terms of efficiency, optimal care dominated current care, with more health gain for less expenditure (28 632 DALYs were averted at a cost of AUD295 million with optimal care, versus 19 297 DALYs averted at a cost of AUD720 million with current care). However, despite the existence of efficacious technologies for treating depression, only 13% of the burden was averted from present active treatment, primarily because of the low effective coverage. Potentially avertable burden is nearly three times this, if effective treatments can be delivered in appropriate amounts to all those who need it. DISCUSSION: This paper reports a method to calculate the burden currently averted from cross-sectional survey data, and to calculate the burden likely to be averted from an optimal programme estimated from randomized controlled trial data. The approach taken here makes a number of assumptions: that people are accurate in reporting their service use, that effect sizes are a suitable basis for modelling improvements in disability and that the method used to translate effect sizes to disability weight change is valid.

25599,Cost-effectiveness of voluntary HIV-1 counselling and testing in reducing sexual transmission of HIV-1 in Kenya and Tanzania,"BACKGROUND: Access to HIV-1 voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) is severely limited in less-developed countries. We undertook a multisite trial of HIV-1 VCT to assess its impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness in less-developed country settings. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of HIV-1 VCT was estimated for a hypothetical cohort of 10000 people seeking VCT in urban east Africa. Outcomes were modelled based on results from a randomised controlled trial of HIV-1 VCT in Tanzania and Kenya. Our main outcome measures included programme cost, number of HIV-1 infections averted, cost per HIV-1 infection averted, and cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved. We also modelled the impact of targeting VCT by HIV-1 prevalence of the client population, and the proportion of clients who receive VCT as a couple compared with as individuals. Sensitivity analysis was done on all model parameters. FINDINGS: HIV-1 VCT was estimated to avert 1104 HIV-1 infections in Kenya and 895 in Tanzania during the subsequent year. The cost per HIV-1 infection averted was US$249 and $346, respectively, and the cost per DALY saved was $12.77 and $17.78. The intervention was most cost-effective for HIV-1-infected people and those who received VCT as a couple. The cost-effectiveness of VCT was robust, with a range for the average cost per DALY saved of $5.16-27.36 in Kenya, and $6.58-45.03 in Tanzania. Analysis of targeting showed that increasing the proportion of couples to 70% reduces the cost per DALY saved to $10.71 in Kenya and $13.39 in Tanzania, and that targeting a population with HIV-1 prevalence of 45% decreased the cost per DALY saved to $8.36 in Kenya and $11.74 in Tanzania. INTERPRETATION: HIV-1 VCT is highly cost-effective in urban east African settings, but slightly less so than interventions such as improvement of sexually transmitted disease services and universal provision of nevirapine to pregnant women in high-prevalence settings. With the targeting of VCT to populations with high HIV-1 prevalence and couples the cost-effectiveness of VCT is improved significantly.",2000-01-0605,10963247,Lancet,M Sweat,2000,356 / 9224,113-21,No,10963247,"M Sweat; S Gregorich; G Sangiwa; C Furlonge; D Balmer; C Kamenga; O Grinstead; T Coates; Toril Hennig; Liv Haehre; Vivian Tryving Hornburg; Petter Mowinckel; Ellen Sauar Norli; Ingvild Kjeken; Cost-effectiveness of voluntary HIV-1 counselling and testing in reducing sexual transmission of HIV-1 in Kenya and Tanzania, Lancet, ; 356(9224):0140-6736; 113-21",DALY,Kenya,Not Stated,Health Education or Behavior,Voluntary HIV-1 counselling and testing among patients enrolled as individuals or couples vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,12.77,United States,1998,20.28
