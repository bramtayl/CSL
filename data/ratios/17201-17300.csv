17201,Strategic Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Improving National Cancer Screening Uptake in Cervical Cancer: A Focus on Regional Inequality in South Korea,"Purpose: To conduct a cost effectiveness analysis of strategies designed to improve national cervical cancer screening rates, along with a distributional cost effectiveness analysis that considers regional disparities. Materials and Methods: Cost effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov cohort simulation model, with Quality Adjusted Life Years as the unit of effectiveness. The strategies considered were a) current: biennial Papanicolaou smear cytology of females aged 20 or above, b) strong screening recommendation by mail to target regions, (effect: 12% increase in screening uptake, cost: 1000 Korean Won per person) c) regular universal screening recommendation by mail, (effect: 6% increase in screening uptake, cost: 500 Korean Won per person) and d) strong universal screening recommendation by mail (effect: 12% increase in screening uptake, cost: 1000 Korean Won per person). Distributional cost effectiveness analysis was conducted by calculating the cost effectiveness of strategies using the Atkinson Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio. Results: All strategies were under the threshold value, which was set as the Korean Gross Domestic Product of $25,990. In particular, the ''strong screening recommendation to target regions'' strategy was found to be the most cost effective (Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio: 7,361,145 Korean Won). This was also true when societal inequality aversion increased in the distributional cost effectiveness analysis. Conclusion: The ''strong screening recommendation to target regions'' strategy was the most cost effective approach, even when adjusting for inequality. As efficiency and equity are objectives concurrently sought in healthcare, these findings imply a need to develop appropriate economic evaluation methodologies to assess healthcare policies.",2017-01-23467,28361522,Cancer Res Treat,Tae-Hoon Lee,2017,/,,No,28361522,"Tae-Hoon Lee; Woorim Kim; Jaeyong Shin; Eun-Cheol Park; Sohee Park; Tae Hyun Kim; Strategic Distributional Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Improving National Cancer Screening Uptake in Cervical Cancer: A Focus on Regional Inequality in South Korea, Cancer Res Treat, 2017 Mar 30; ():2005-9256",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Not Stated,Current (baseline) vs. None,Null,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.00,1.00,8584172,South Korea,2016,7960.78

17203,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Regorafenib for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST) in Germany,"BACKGROUND: No study has compared the cost-effectiveness of active treatment options for unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumours in patients who progressed on or are intolerant to prior treatment with imatinib and sunitinib. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of regorafenib compared to imatinib rechallenge in this setting in Germany. METHODS: Hazard ratios for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with regorafenib versus imatinib rechallenge were estimated by indirect comparison. A state distribution model was used to simulate progression, mortality and treatment costs over a lifetime horizon. Drug acquisition costs and utilities were derived from clinical trial data and published literature; non-drug costs were not included. The outcomes measured were treatment costs, life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The indirect comparison suggested that median PFS and OS were longer with regorafenib compared to imatinib but results were not statistically significant. Regorafenib versus imatinib rechallenge was estimated to have hazard ratios of 0.58 (95% CI 0.31-1.11) for PFS and 0.77 (95% CI 0.34-1.77) for OS, with substantial uncertainty due to the rarity of the disease and small number of patients within the trials. Regorafenib treatment per patient over a lifetime horizon provided an additional 0.61 LYs and 0.42 QALYs over imatinib rechallenge, with additional direct drug costs of euro8,773. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro21,127 per QALY gained. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of euro50,000 per QALY, regorafenib had a 67% probability of being cost-effective. CONCLUSION: Based on the currently available clinical data, this analysis suggests that regorafenib is cost-effective compared with imatinib rechallenge in Germany.",2017-01-23468,28361439,Clin Drug Investig,David Tamoschus,2017,37 / 6,525-533,Yes,28361439,"David Tamoschus; Katja Draexler; Jane Chang; Christopher Ngai; Matthew Madin-Warburton; Ashley Pitcher; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Regorafenib for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumour (GIST) in Germany, Clin Drug Investig, 2017 Jun; 37(6):1173-2563; 525-533",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Regorafenib with the Arzneimittelmarkt-Neuordnungsgesetz (AMNOG) process vs. Imatinib rechallenge,Patients with metastatic and/or unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumours after treatment failure with at least imatinib and sunitinib,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,21127,Euro,2016,25209.93
17204,Economic evaluation of an exercise-counselling intervention to enhance smoking cessation outcomes: The Fit2Quit trial,"BACKGROUND: In the Fit2Quit randomised controlled trial, insufficiently-active adult cigarette smokers who contacted Quitline for support to quit smoking were randomised to usual Quitline support or to also receive </=10 face-to-face and telephone exercise-support sessions delivered by trained exercise facilitators over the 24-week trial. This paper aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of an exercise-counselling intervention added to Quitline compared to Quitline alone in the Fit2Quit trial. METHODS: Within-trial and lifetime cost-effectiveness were assessed. A published Markov model was adapted, with smokers facing increased risks of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease. RESULTS: Over 24 weeks, the incremental programme cost per participant in the intervention was NZ$428 (US$289 or euro226; purchasing power parity-adjusted [PPP]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for seven-day point prevalence measured at 24-week follow-up was NZ$31,733 (US$21,432 or euro16,737 PPP-adjusted) per smoker abstaining. However, for the 52% who adhered to the intervention (>/=7 contacts), the ICER for point prevalence was NZ$3,991 (US$2,695 or euro2,105 PPP-adjusted). In this adherent subgroup, the Markov model estimated 0.057 and 0.068 discounted quality-adjusted life-year gains over the lifetime of 40-year-old males (ICER: NZ$4,431; US$2,993 or euro2,337 PPP-adjusted) and females (ICER: NZ$2,909; US$1,965 or euro1,534 PPP-adjusted). CONCLUSIONS: The exercise-counselling intervention will only be cost-effective if adherence is a minimum of >/=7 intervention calls, which in turn leads to a sufficient number of quitters for health gains.

17206,Economic evaluation of aerobic exercise training in older adults with vascular cognitive impairment: PROMoTE trial,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Evidence suggests that aerobic exercise may slow the progression of subcortical ischaemic vascular cognitive impairment (SIVCI) by modifying cardiovascular risk factors. Yet the economic consequences relating to aerobic training (AT) remain unknown. Therefore, our primary objective was to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained of a thrice weekly AT intervention compared with usual care. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis alongside a randomised trial. SETTING: Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: 70 adults (mean age of 74 years, 51% women) who meet the diagnostic criteria for mild SIVCI. INTERVENTION: A 6-month, thrice weekly, progressive aerobic exercise training programme compared with usual care (CON; comparator) with a follow-up assessment 6 months after formal cessation of aerobic exercise training. MEASUREMENTS: Healthcare resource usage was estimated over the 6-month intervention and 6-month follow-up period. Health status (using the EQ-5D-3L) at baseline and trial completion and 6-month follow-up was used to calculate QALYs. The incremental cost-utility ratio (cost per QALY gained) was calculated. RESULTS: QALYs were both modestly greater, indicating a health gain. Total healthcare costs (ie, 1791+/-1369 {2015 $CAD} at 6 months) were greater, indicating a greater cost for the thrice weekly AT group compared with CON. From the Canadian healthcare system perspective, the incremental cost-utility ratios for thrice weekly AT were cost-effective compared with CON, when using a willingness to pay threshold of $CAD 20 000 per QALY gained or higher. CONCLUSIONS: AT represents an attractive and potentially cost-effective strategy for older adults with mild SIVCI.

17208,Economic Evaluation of a Home-Based Age-Related Macular Degeneration Monitoring System,"Background: Medicare recently approved coverage of home telemonitoring for early detection of incident choroidal neovascularization (CNV) among patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but no economic evaluation has yet assessed its cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact. Objectives: To evaluate a home-based daily visual-field monitoring system using simulation methods and to apply the findings of the Home Monitoring of the Eye study to the US population at high risk for wet-form AMD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic analysis, an evaluation of the potential cost, cost-effectiveness, and government budgetary impact of adoption of a home-based daily visual-field monitoring system among eligible Medicare patients was performed. Effectiveness and visual outcomes data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 Home Monitoring of the Eye study, treatment data from the Wills Eye Hospital Treat & Extend study, and AMD progression data from the Age-Related Eye Disease Study 1 were used to simulate the long-term effects of telemonitoring patients with CNV in one eye or large drusen and/or pigment abnormalities in both eyes. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis and an alternative scenario using the Treat & Extend study control group outcomes were used to examine uncertainty in these data and assumptions. Interventions: Home telemonitoring of patients with AMD for early detection of CNV vs usual care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, net present value of lifetime societal costs, and 10-year nominal government expenditures. Result: Telemonitoring of patients with existing unilateral CNV or multiple bilateral risk factors for CNV (large drusen and retinal pigment abnormalities) incurs $907 (95% CI, -$6302 to $2809) in net lifetime societal costs, costs $1312 (95% CI, $222-$2848) per patient during 10 years from the federal government''s perspective, and results in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $35663 (95% CI, cost savings to $235613) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Conclusions and Relevance: Home telemonitoring of patients with AMD who are at risk for CNV was cost-effective compared with scheduled examinations alone. Monitoring patients with existing CNV in one eye is cost saving, but monitoring is generally not cost-effective among patients with low risk of CNV, including those with no or few risk factors. With Medicare coverage, monitoring incurs budgetary expenditures for the government but is cost-saving for patients at high risk of AMD. Monitoring could be cost saving to society if monitoring reduced the frequency of scheduled examinations or led to a reduction of one or more injections of ranibizumab.",2017-01-23476,28358948,JAMA Ophthalmol,John S Wittenborn,2017,135 / 5,452-459,No,28358948,"John S Wittenborn; Traci Clemons; Carl Regillo; Nadim Rayess; Danielle Liffmann Kruger; David Rein; Economic Evaluation of a Home-Based Age-Related Macular Degeneration Monitoring System, JAMA Ophthalmol, 2017 May 01; 135(5):2168-6173; 452-459",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,ForeseeHome system (home telemonitoring for early detection of incident choroidal neovascularization) vs. Standard/Usual Care,Patients with Stage 3 or 4 age-related macular degeneration or chorodial neovasculrization in 1 eye,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,35663,United States,2016,38457.11
17209,Economic Analysis of Apixaban Therapy for Patients With Atrial Fibrillation From a US Perspective: Results From the ARISTOTLE Randomized Clinical Trial,"Importance: The Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) trial reported that apixaban therapy was superior to warfarin therapy in preventing stroke and all-cause death while causing significantly fewer major bleeds. To establish the value proposition of substituting apixiban therapy for warfarin therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using patient-level data from the ARISTOTLE trial. Objective: To assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of apixaban therapy compared with warfarin therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation from the perspective of the US health care system. Design, Setting, and Participants: This economic analysis uses patient-level resource use and clinical data collected in the ARISTOTLE trial, a multinational randomized clinical trial that observed 18201 patients (3417 US patients) for a median of 1.8 years between 2006 and 2011. Interventions: Apixaban therapy vs warfarin therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Within-trial resource use and cost were compared between treatments, using externally derived US cost weights. Life expectancies for US patients were estimated according to their baseline risk and treatment using time-based and age-based survival models developed using the overall ARISTOTLE population. Quality-of-life adjustment factors were obtained from external sources. Cost-effectiveness (incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained) was evaluated from a US perspective, and extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Of the 3417 US patients enrolled in ARISTOTLE, the mean (SD) age was 71 (10) years; 2329 (68.2%) were male and 3264 (95.5%) were white. After 2 years of anticoagulation therapy, health care costs (excluding the study drug) of patients treated with apixaban therapy and warfarin therapy were not statistically different (difference, -$60; 95% CI, -$2728 to $2608). Life expectancy, modeled from ARISTOTLE outcomes, was significantly longer with apixaban therapy vs warfarin therapy (7.94 vs 7.54 quality-adjusted life years). The incremental cost, including cost of anticoagulant and monitoring, of achieving these benefits was within accepted US norms ($53925 per quality-adjusted life year, with 98% likelihood of meeting a $100000 willingness-to-pay threshold). Results were generally consistent when model assumptions were varied, with lifetime cost-effectiveness most affected by the price of apixaban and the time horizon. Conclusions and Relevance: Apixaban therapy for ARISTOTLE-eligible patients with atrial fibrillation provides clinical benefits at an incremental cost that represents reasonable value for money judged using US benchmarks for cost-effectiveness.

17210,"Cochlear Implants Versus Hearing Aids in a Middle-Income Country: Costs, Productivity, and Quality of Life","OBJECTIVE: In Colombia there are three main treatment approaches for bilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss, also known as profound deafness (PD): cochlear implants (CI), hearing aids (HA), and no treatment (NT). The objective of this study is to determine the optimal treatment approach for PD in terms of productivity and cost-effectiveness. STUDY DESIGN: Hearing levels and SES data were obtained from audiometric tests conducted on 100 patients with CI. For each treatment approach, productivity and cost-effectiveness assessments were estimated using influence diagrams and Monte Carlo simulations. Productivity was calculated as the net present value of a patient''s lifetime income divided by total health-related and educational costs. For the CI and HA, the cost-effectiveness indicator was calculated as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained in comparison with the NT approach divided by the total cost of the treatment option. RESULTS: The results for the CI, the HA, and NT in terms of productivity ratio were 1.53, 0.94, and 1.47, respectively. Patients using CI had a gain of 5.7 QALYs, whereas patients using HA had a gain of 4.6 QALYs. The results for the CI and the HA in terms of cost-effectiveness were $15,169 and $15,430 per QALY, respectively. CONCLUSION: The CI was found to be the optimal treatment for PD, as it was the most efficient and cost-effective in terms of improving patients'' productivity and quality of life.

17212,Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of second-line chemotherapy in elderly patients with advanced gastric cancer,"PURPOSE: Second-line chemotherapy has been shown to benefit patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC), extending the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). This study aimed to assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of second-line treatment for elderly patients with AGC. METHODS: Medical records and follow-up information of elderly patients (>/=70 years) with AGC who received second-line chemotherapy were collected. A Markov model comprising three health states PFS, progressive disease and death was developed to simulate the process of AGC. Cost was calculated from the perspective of Chinese society. Sensitivity analyses were applied to explore the impact of essential variables. RESULTS: Forty-three elderly patients with AGC receiving second-line chemotherapy were included in our study. The median OS was 6.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.90-8.10) and PFS was 3.1 months (95% CI 1.38-4.82). No treatment-related death occurred. The most frequently drug-related grade 3/4 AEs were diarrhea (2.3%), leukopenia (16.3%) and nausea (7.0%). The incremental cost-effective ratio was $18,223.75/QALY for second-line chemotherapy versus BSC, which was below the threshold of 3x the per capita GDP of China, $23,970.00.

17221,Impact of total knee replacement practice: cost effectiveness analysis of data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative,"Objectives To evaluate the impact of total knee replacement on quality of life in people with knee osteoarthritis and to estimate associated differences in lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) according to use by level of symptoms.Design Marginal structural modeling and cost effectiveness analysis based on lifetime predictions for total knee replacement and death from population based cohort data.Setting Data from two studies-Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) and the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST)-within the US health system.Participants 4498 participants with or at high risk for knee osteoarthritis aged 45-79 from the OAI with no previous knee replacement (confirmed by baseline radiography) followed up for nine years. Validation cohort comprised 2907 patients from MOST with two year follow-up.Intervention Scenarios ranging from current practice, defined as total knee replacement practice as performed in the OAI (with procedural rates estimated by a prediction model), to practice limited to patients with severe symptoms to no surgery.Main outcome measures Generic (SF-12) and osteoarthritis specific quality of life measured over 96 months, model based QALYs, costs, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios over a lifetime horizon.Results In the OAI, total knee replacement showed improvements in quality of life with small absolute changes when averaged across levels of confounding variables: 1.70 (95% uncertainty interval 0.26 to 3.57) for SF-12 physical component summary (PCS); -10.69 (-13.39 to -8.01) for Western Ontario and McMaster Universities arthritis index (WOMAC); and 9.16 (6.35 to 12.49) for knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score (KOOS) quality of life subscale. These improvements became larger with decreasing functional status at baseline. Provision of total knee replacement to patients with SF-12 PCS scores <35 was the optimal scenario given a cost effectiveness threshold of $200 000/QALY, with cost savings of $6974 ($5789 to $8269) and a minimal loss of 0.008 (-0.056 to 0.043) QALYs compared with current practice.

17222,Bending the Cost Curve-Establishing Value in Spine Surgery,"BACKGROUND: As publically promoted by all stakeholders in health care reform, prospective outcomes registry platforms lie at the center of all current evidence-driven value-based models. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the variability in outcomes and cost at population level and individual patient level for patients undergoing spine surgery for degenerative diseases. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of prospective longitudinal spine registry data was conducted. Baseline and postoperative 1-year patient-reported outcomes were recorded. Previously published minimal clinically important difference for Oswestry Disability Index (14.9) was used. Back-related resource utilization and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were assessed. Variations in outcomes and cost were analyzed at population level and at the individual patient level. RESULTS: A total of 1454 patients were analyzed. There was significant improvement in patient-reported outcomes at postoperative 1 year ( P < .0001). For patients demonstrating health benefit at population level, 12.5%, n = 182 of patients experienced no gain from surgery and 38%, n = 554 failed to achieve minimal clinically important difference. Mean 1-year QALY-gained was 0.29; 18% of patients failed to report gain in QALY. For patients with 2-year follow-up, surgery resulted in 0.62 QALY-gained at average direct cost of $28 953. A wide variation in both QALY-gained and cost was observed. CONCLUSION: Spine treatments that on average are cost-effective may have wide variability in value at the individual patient level. The variability demonstrated here represents an opportunity, through registries, to identify specific care that may be less effective, and refine patient-specific care delivery and indications to drive overall group-level treatment value. Understanding value of spine care at an individualized as well as population level will allow clinicians, and eventually payers, to better target resources for improving care for nonresponders, ultimately driving up the average health for the whole population.",2017-01-23489,28350948,Neurosurgery,Scott L Parker,2017,80 / 3S,S61-S69,No,28350948,"Scott L Parker; Silky Chotai; Clinton J Devin; Lindsay Tetreault; Thomas E Mroz; Darrel S Brodke; Michael G Fehlings; Matthew J McGirt; Bending the Cost Curve-Establishing Value in Spine Surgery, Neurosurgery, 2017 Mar 01; 80(3S):0148-396X; S61-S69",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Spine surgery vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,51762,United States,2015,56521.58
17223,A Cost-Effectiveness Model for Frail Older Persons: Development and Application to a Physiotherapy-Based Intervention,"INTRODUCTION: The clinical importance of frailty is increasing. Existing economic evaluations of interventions to manage frailty have limited time horizons, but even in older populations there may be important longer-term differences in costs and outcomes. This paper reports on the development of a cost-effectiveness model to predict publicly funded health and aged care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the remaining lifetime of frail Australians and a model-based cost-utility analysis of a physiotherapy-based intervention for frail individuals. METHODS: A cohort-based state transition (Markov) model was developed to predict costs and QALYs over the remaining lifetime of a frail population. Frailty is defined using the phenotypic definition of frailty, and the model comprises health states that describe frailty status, residential status, the experience of bone fractures and depression, and death. Model input parameters were estimated and calibrated using the Dynamic Analyses to Optimise Ageing dataset, supplemented with data from the published literature. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness model was subject to a range of validation approaches, which did not negate the validity of the model. The evaluated physiotherapy-based frailty intervention has an expected incremental cost per QALY gained of Australian $8129 compared to usual care, but there is a probability of 0.3 that usual care is more effective and less costly than the intervention. DISCUSSION: Frailty reduces quality of life, is costly to manage and it''s prevalence is increasing, but new approaches to managing frailty need to demonstrate value for money. The value of the reported cost-effectiveness model is illustrated through the estimation of all important costs and effects of a physiotherapy-based frailty intervention, which facilitates comparisons with funding decisions for other new technologies in Australia.",2017-01-23491,28349499,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Jonathan Karnon,2017,/,,Yes,28349499,"Jonathan Karnon; Hossein Haji Ali Afzali; Gregorius Virgianto Arpu Putro; Phyu Win Thant; Ameline Dompok; Ingrid Cox; Owen Henry Chikhwaza; Xian Wang; Mercy Mukui Mwangangi; Matahari Farransahat; Ian Cameron; A Cost-Effectiveness Model for Frail Older Persons: Development and Application to a Physiotherapy-Based Intervention, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2017 Apr 03; ():1179-1896",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Physiotherapy-based intervention vs. Standard/Usual Care,Frailty,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,8129,Australia,2015,6676.71
17224,IDegLira Versus Insulin Glargine U100: A Long-term Cost-effectiveness Analysis in the US Setting,"INTRODUCTION: Treatment with IDegLira has the potential to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without the weight gain and with a lower risk of hypoglycemia than with other therapies. The aim of the present analysis was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira versus insulin glargine U100 with re-education and up-titration of the dose for treatment of patients with T2DM failing to achieve glycemic control on basal insulin in the US setting. METHODS: Data were obtained from the DUAL V randomized controlled trial in which adults with T2DM failing to achieve glycemic targets with insulin glargine U100 were randomly allocated to receive either IDegLira or insulin glargine U100. Long-term projections of clinical outcomes and direct costs were made using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model. Costs were accounted from a healthcare payer perspective. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3% annually. RESULTS: IDegLira was associated with improved discounted life expectancy (13.99 [standard deviation 0.19] versus 13.82 [standard deviation 0.20] years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (9.14 [standard deviation 0.12] versus 8.87 [standard deviation 0.13] quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) compared to insulin glargine U100. IDegLira was associated with increased direct costs of $16,970, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $63,678 per QALY gained versus insulin glargine U100. Sensitivity analyses identified that the key driver of cost-effectiveness was the greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin with IDegLira compared with insulin glargine U100. CONCLUSIONS: Based on head-to-head clinical trial data, the present analysis suggests that IDegLira is likely to improve long-term clinical outcomes for patients with T2DM not achieving glycemic control on basal insulin compared to re-education and up-titration of the dose of insulin glargine U100, with these improvements coming at an increased cost from a healthcare payer perspective. An ICER within the range described as high care value was calculated, suggesting IDegLira is a cost-effective treatment option in the US.

17225,Cost-Effectiveness of Liraglutide Versus Dapagliflozin for the Treatment of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in the UK,"INTRODUCTION: To date there is a lack of economic analysis comparing glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) to sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Liraglutide and dapagliflozin are the most commonly prescribed GLP-1RA and SGLT-2i in the UK. This analysis investigated the cost-effectiveness of liraglutide 1.2 and 1.8 mg/day compared to dapagliflozin 10 mg/day for the treatment of T2DM in the UK in patients on dual and triple antidiabetic therapy. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in the QuintilesIMS CORE Diabetes Model (CDM). The model estimated expected costs and outcomes over a lifetime horizon using the UK national payer perspective. Liraglutide efficacy estimates and patient characteristics were sourced from a trial in patients on prior metformin monotherapy, and from a trial in patients on prior combination therapy. Comparative efficacy data for the other interventions were derived from a network meta-analysis. Utility inputs were extracted from a systematic literature review. Costs are presented in Great British Pound (GBP), 2016 values. RESULTS: In dual and triple therapy, liraglutide 1.2 mg was less costly and more effective compared with dapagliflozin 10 mg, providing a QALY gain of 0.04 and cost savings of GBP 11 per patient in dual therapy, and a QALY gain of 0.06 and cost savings of GBP 71 per patient in triple therapy. For liraglutide 1.8 mg, increased efficacy and costs compared with dapagliflozin 10 mg were observed in both dual and triple therapy. In dual therapy, a QALY gain of 0.07 and additional costs of GBP 888 per patient yielded an ICER of GBP 13,227, whereas in triple therapy a QALY gain of 0.07 and additional cost of GBP 791 per patient gave an ICER of 11,857. CONCLUSION: This long-term modelling analysis found that both dosages of liraglutide may be cost-effective treatment alternatives as part of a dual or a triple antidiabetic therapy in patients for whom an SGLT-2i therapy is considered.

17229,Cost-effectiveness of Maintaining Daily Intake of Oat beta-Glucan for Coronary Heart Disease Primary Prevention,"PURPOSE: Oat beta-glucan reduces cholesterol levels and thus reduces the risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, its economic impact has not been well studied. We examined the economic impact of daily intake of >/=3 g of oat beta-glucan in primary prevention of CHD in patients receiving statins or no pharmacologic treatment. METHODS: A decision model was developed to compare costs and outcomes associated with lowering cholesterol levels with no pharmacologic treatment and normal diet, no pharmacologic treatment plus >/=3 g/d of oat beta-glucan, and statin therapy plus >/=3 g/d of oat beta-glucan. The population comprised men 45, 55, or 65 years of age with no history of cardiovascular disease and a 10-year risk for CHD of 5%, 7.5%, or 10%. Clinical efficacy data were gathered from meta-analyses; safety data, costs, and utilities were gathered from published literature. Cost per quality-adjusted life years and number of first events were reported. FINDINGS: Maintaining >/=3 g/d of beta-glucan may be cost-effective in men aged 45, 55, and 65 years with 10-year CHD risks of 5.0%, 7.5%, and 10.0% taking no pharmacologic treatment or on statins. It may also reduce first events of myocardial infarction and CHD death. Results are sensitive to oat beta-glucan cost but insensitive to changes in other parameters. Maintaining >/=3 g of oat beta-glucan daily remains cost-effective within plausible range of values.

17230,Is Universal HLA-B*15:02 Screening a Cost-Effective Option in an Ethnically-Diverse Population? A Case Study of Malaysia,"BACKGROUND: Strong association was documented between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*15:02 and carbamazepine-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in Asians. Beyond Asia, the HLA testing is potentially valuable in many countries with increasingly diverse communities of Asian ancestry, to facilitate an early recognition of patient susceptibility to SCARs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of universal HLA-B*15:02 screening in preventing carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis in an ethnically-diverse Malaysian population. METHODS: A hybrid model of a decision tree and Markov model was developed to evaluate three strategies for treating newly-diagnosed epilepsy among adults - (i) carbamazepine initiation without HLA-B*15:02 screening (current practice); (ii) universal HLA-B*15:02 screening prior to carbamazepine initiation; and (iii) alternative treatment [sodium valproate (VPA)] prescribing without HLA-B*15:02 screening. From a societal perspective, base-case analysis and sensitivity analyses were performed over lifetime time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, both universal HLA-B*15:02 screening and VPA prescribing were dominated by current practice. Compared to current practice, universal HLA-B*15:02 screening resulted in 0.0255 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) loss at an additional cost of USD707, while VPA prescribing resulted in 0.2622 QALYs loss at an additional cost of USD4,127, due to estimated differences in antiepileptic treatment efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that universal HLA-B*15:02 screening is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention in Malaysia compared to current practice. However, with the emergence of an ethnically-diverse population in many other countries, this may render HLA-B*15:02 screening a potentially viable intervention when an increasing proportion of the population is at risk and an equally effective yet safer antiepileptic drug is available.

17231,Is Universal HLA-B*15:02 Screening a Cost-Effective Option in an Ethnically-Diverse Population? A Case Study of Malaysia,"BACKGROUND: Strong association was documented between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*15:02 and carbamazepine-induced severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) in Asians. Beyond Asia, the HLA testing is potentially valuable in many countries with increasingly diverse communities of Asian ancestry, to facilitate an early recognition of patient susceptibility to SCARs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of universal HLA-B*15:02 screening in preventing carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/ toxic epidermal necrolysis in an ethnically-diverse Malaysian population. METHODS: A hybrid model of a decision tree and Markov model was developed to evaluate three strategies for treating newly-diagnosed epilepsy among adults - (i) carbamazepine initiation without HLA-B*15:02 screening (current practice); (ii) universal HLA-B*15:02 screening prior to carbamazepine initiation; and (iii) alternative treatment [sodium valproate (VPA)] prescribing without HLA-B*15:02 screening. From a societal perspective, base-case analysis and sensitivity analyses were performed over lifetime time horizon. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, both universal HLA-B*15:02 screening and VPA prescribing were dominated by current practice. Compared to current practice, universal HLA-B*15:02 screening resulted in 0.0255 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) loss at an additional cost of USD707, while VPA prescribing resulted in 0.2622 QALYs loss at an additional cost of USD4,127, due to estimated differences in antiepileptic treatment efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that universal HLA-B*15:02 screening is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention in Malaysia compared to current practice. However, with the emergence of an ethnically-diverse population in many other countries, this may render HLA-B*15:02 screening a potentially viable intervention when an increasing proportion of the population is at risk and an equally effective yet safer antiepileptic drug is available.

17232,Cost-Utility of Group Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Fibromyalgia Versus Recommended Drugs: An Economic Analysis Alongside a 6-Month Randomized Controlled Trial Conducted in Spain (EFFIGACT Study),"The aim of this study was to analyze the cost utility of a group-based form of acceptance and commitment therapy (GACT) in patients with fibromyalgia (FM) compared with patients receiving recommended pharmacological treatment (RPT) or on a waiting list (WL). The data were derived from a previously published study, a randomized controlled trial that focused on clinical outcomes. Health economic outcomes included health-related quality of life and health care use at baseline and at 6-month follow-up using the EuroQoL and the Client Service Receipt Inventory, respectively. Analyses included quality-adjusted life years, direct and indirect cost differences, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios. A total of 156 FM patients were randomized (51 GACT, 52 RPT, 53 WL). GACT was related to significantly less direct costs over the 6-month study period compared with both control arms (GACT euro824.2 +/- 1,062.7 vs RPT euro1,730.7 +/- 1,656.8 vs WL euro2,462.7 +/- 2,822.0). Lower direct costs for GACT compared with RPT were due to lower costs from primary care visits and FM-related medications. The incremental cost effectiveness ratios were dominant in the completers'' analysis and remained robust in the sensitivity analyses. In conclusion, acceptance and commitment therapy appears to be a cost-effective treatment compared with RPT in patients with FM. PERSPECTIVE: Decision-makers have to prioritize their budget on the treatment option that is the most cost effective for the management of a specific patient group.

17237,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Obinutuzumab for Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia in Portuguese Patients who are Unsuitable for Full-Dose Fludarabine-Based Therapy,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) mostly affects patients with comorbidities and limited therapeutic options. Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) is a new therapeutic option for previously untreated CLL patients who are unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine-based therapy. This combination delays disease progression but incurs additional costs; thus, an assessment of its value for money is relevant. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-utility ratio of GClb in comparison with (i) rituximab in combination with chlorambucil (RClb), and (ii) chlorambucil alone (Clb) from the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A Markov model was used to predict disease progression. Pre-progression clinical data were based on the latest CLL11 trial data, and post-progression clinical data were obtained from CLL5 trial data. Utility values are from Kosmas et al. (Leuk Lymphoma 56:1320-1326, 14). Only direct medical costs were included. The resource consumption was estimated by a panel of Portuguese experts, and the unit costs were obtained from official sources. A discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and consequences. RESULTS: GClb and RClb were associated with an increase of 1.06 and 0.39 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) at an additional cost of euro21,720 and euro9836 when compared to Clb, respectively. The cost-utility ratio of GClb versus Clb was euro20,397/QALY, while RClb was extendedly dominated. CONCLUSIONS: The use of GClb for previously untreated CLL patients who are unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine-based therapy incurs an incremental cost per QALY that is generally accepted in Portugal.

Data from the published scientific literature and registries were used to construct the model and estimate lifelong effects and costs. Costs and effects generated by 2 147 483 648 different screening designs were calculated and compared. Program designs that implied worse clinical outcome and were less cost-effective compared to other programs were excluded from the analysis. Seven program designs were identified, and considered to be cost effective depending on what the health-care decision makers are ready to pay for gaining a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

17246,An Early Health Economic Analysis of the Potential Cost Effectiveness of an Adherence Intervention to Improve Outcomes for Patients with Cystic Fibrosis,"BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) negatively impacts upon health-related quality of life and survival. Adherence to nebulised treatments is low; improving adherence is hypothesised to reduce rates of exacerbation requiring intravenous antibiotics and lung function decline. OBJECTIVE: A state transition model was developed to assess the cost effectiveness of an intervention aimed at increasing patient adherence to nebulised and inhaled antibiotics compared with current CF care, in advance of the forthcoming CFHealthHub randomised controlled trial (RCT). METHODS: The model estimated the costs and health outcomes for each option from the perspective of the UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services over a lifetime horizon. Health gains were valued in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) trajectories were predicted over three lung function strata: (1) FEV1 >/=70%, (2) FEV1 40-69% and (3) FEV1 <40%. Additional states were included to represent ''post-lung transplantation'' and ''dead''. The model was populated using CF Registry data, literature and expert opinion. Costs were presented at 2016 values. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: If effective, the adherence intervention is expected to produce an additional 0.19 QALYs and cost savings of pound64,078 per patient. Across all analyses, the intervention dominated current care. Over a 5-year period, the intervention is expected to generate cost savings of pound49.5 million for the estimated 2979 patients with CF with Pseudomonas aeruginosa currently aged >/=16 years in the UK. If applied to a broader population of adult patients with CF receiving any nebulised therapy, the expected savings could be considerably greater. CONCLUSIONS: If effective, the adherence intervention is expected to produce additional health gains at a lower cost than current CF care. However, the economic analysis should be revisited upon completion of the full RCT. More generally, the analysis suggests that considerable gains could be accrued through the implementation of adherence interventions that shift care from expensive hospital-based rescue to community-based prevention.",2017-01-23514,28337719,Pharmacoeconomics,Paul Tappenden,2017,35 / 6,647-659,Yes,28337719,"Paul Tappenden; Susannah Sadler; Martin Wildman; An Early Health Economic Analysis of the Potential Cost Effectiveness of an Adherence Intervention to Improve Outcomes for Patients with Cystic Fibrosis, Pharmacoeconomics, 2017 Jun; 35(6):1179-2027; 647-659",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nebulizer + behavior intervention vs. Standard/Usual Care,Adult patients with cystic fibrosis receiving traditional nebulised or dry powder inhaled antibiotics,Not Stated,16 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-337247.37,United Kingdom,2016,-492960.95

17251,The cost-effectiveness of alectinib in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib,"Introduction Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) targeting drugs provide an important option for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with this distinct tumor type; however, there is considerable uncertainty as to which drug provides the optimal value after crizotinib treatment. This study estimated the cost-utility of alectinib vs ceritinib from a US payer perspective. Methods A cost-utility model was developed using partition survival methods and three health states: progression-free (PF), post-progression (PP), and death. Survival data were derived from the key clinical trials (alectinib: NP28761 & NP28673, ceritinib: ASCEND I and II). Costs included drugs, adverse events, and supportive care. Utilities were based on trial data and the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. Results Treatment with alectinib vs ceritinib resulted in increases of 2.55 months in the PF state, 0.44 quality adjusted life-years (QALYs), and $13,868, yielding a mean cost/QALY of $31,180. In the PSA, alectinib had a 96% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $100,000/QALY. Drivers of model results were drug costs and utilities in the PF health state. The ICER ranged from $10,600-$65,000 per QALY in scenario analyses, including a sub-group analysis limited to patients with prior chemotherapy and crizotinib treatment. Conclusions Treatment with alectinib in ALK + crizotinib-treated patients increased time progression-free and QALYs vs ceritinib. The marginal cost increase was driven by longer treatment durations with alectinib. This model demonstrates that alectinib may be considered a cost-effective treatment after progression on crizotinib.",2017-01-23519,28332433,J Med Econ,J J Carlson,2017,/,1-7,Yes,28332433,"J J Carlson; W Canestaro; A Ravelo; W Wong; The cost-effectiveness of alectinib in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib, J Med Econ, 2017 May 22; ():1369-6998; 1-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Alectinib vs. Ceritinib,Alectinib in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive (ALK+) advanced NSCLC,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,0.00,31518.18,United States,2016,33987.56
17252,Differentiated HIV Rna Viral Load Monitoring in Resource Limited Settings: An Economic Analysis,"Background: Viral load (VL) monitoring for patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) is recommended worldwide. However, the costs of frequent monitoring are a barrier to implementation in resource-limited settings. The extent to which personalized monitoring frequencies may be cost-effective is unknown. Methods: We created a simulation model parameterized using person-level longitudinal data to assess the benefits of flexible monitoring frequencies. Our data-driven model tracked HIV+ individuals for 10 years following ART initiation. We optimized the interval between viral load tests as a function of patients'' age, gender, education, duration since ART initiation, adherence behavior, and the cost-effectiveness threshold (CET). We compared the cost-effectiveness of the personalized monitoring strategies to fixed monitoring intervals every 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Results: Shorter fixed VL monitoring intervals yielded increasing benefits (6.034 to 6.221 discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient with monitoring every 24 to 1 month over 10 years, respectively, standard error 0.005 QALY), at increasing average costs: USD3445 (annual monitoring) to USD5393 (monthly monitoring) per patient, respectively (standard error USD3.7). The adaptive policy optimized for low-income contexts achieved 6.142 average QALYs at a cost of USD3524, similar to the fixed 12-month policy (6.135 QALY, USD3518). The adaptive policy optimized for middle-income resource settings yields 0.008 fewer QALYs per person, but saves USD204 compared to monitoring every three months.

METHODS: Observational, prospective and multicenter study comparing treatments of knee OA costs and efficacy with either NSAIDs alone, or hyaluronic acid (Arthrum H 2%(R)), during a 6-month follow-up period. The investigators were pharmacists who recorded data on disease, drug consumption and healthcare circuit. Retrospectively, the 6-month period preceding inclusion was also studied, to ensure the comparability of groups. RESULTS: 199 patients were analyzed in a NSAIDs group and 202 in an IA HA group. Any of the WOMAC sub-scores and the EQ-5D Quality of Life index were significantly improved in the IA HA group (p<0.0001) at 3 and 6 months. Clinical results were therefore in favor of the IA HA group. The total drug expenses per 6-month period were comparable before and after inclusion, euro96 and euro98 for NSAIDs group vs euro94 and euro101 for IA HA group, which indicates no evidence of additional cost from IA HA. For the active part of the population, the incidence of sick leave was lower in the IA HA group, indicating a better maintenance of patient activity. The overall expense on 12 months (6 months before and 6 months after inclusion) for the national health insurance system was comparable for NSAIDs and IA HA groups: euro528 and euro526, respectively. The number of patients taking NSAIDs significantly decreased in IA HA group (from 100% at inclusion to 66% at 1-3 months and 44% at 4-6 months), but remained unchanged (100%) during the follow-up period, in NSAIDs group. CONCLUSION: Treatment with IA HA did not generate additional cost for the national health insurance and was associated with a functional improvement of knee osteoarthritis and Quality of Life. The cost-utility analysis was in favor of IA HA, with a gain of QALY equivalent to half a month, after the 6-month follow-up period comparing both treatments. The NSAIDs consumption was decreased in the IA HA group, resulting in an improved estimated benefit/risk ratio.",2017-01-23529,28328935,PLoS One,Thierry Thomas,2017,12 / 3,e0173683,No,28328935,"Thierry Thomas; Francoise Amouroux; Patrice Vincent; Intra articular hyaluronic acid in the management of knee osteoarthritis: Pharmaco-economic study from the perspective of the national health insurance system, PLoS One , 2017; 12(3):1932-6203; e0173683",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intra articular hyaluronic acid (IA HA) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),Not Stated,75 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,215,Euro,2015,260.53
17256,The Cost of Brain Surgery: Awake vs Asleep Craniotomy for Perirolandic Region Tumors,"BACKGROUND: Cost effectiveness has become an important factor in the health care system, requiring surgeons to improve efficacy of procedures while reducing costs. An awake craniotomy (AC) with direct cortical stimulation (DCS) presents one method to resect eloquent region tumors; however, some authors assert that this procedure is an expensive alternative to surgery under general anesthesia (GA) with neuromonitoring. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness and clinical outcomes between AC and GA patients. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of a cohort of 17 patients with perirolandic gliomas who underwent an AC with DCS were case-control matched with 23 patients with perirolandic gliomas who underwent surgery under GA with neuromonitoring (ie, motor-evoked potentials, somatosensory-evoked potentials, phase reversal). Inpatient costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), extent of resection, and neurological outcome were compared between the groups. RESULTS: Total inpatient expense per patient was ${\$}$ 34 804 in the AC group and ${\$}$ 46 798 in the GA group ( P = .046). QALY score for the AC group was 0.97 and 0.47 for the GA group ( P = .041). The incremental cost per QALY for the AC group was ${\$}$ 82 720 less than the GA group. Postoperative Karnofsky performance status was 91.8 in the AC group and 81.3 in the GA group (P = .047). Length of hospitalization was 4.12 days in the AC group and 7.61 days in the GA group ( P = .049). CONCLUSION: The total inpatient costs for awake craniotomies were lower than surgery under GA.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness and improvement in quality of life (QOL) of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: PVP is known to relieve back pain and increase QOL for osteoporotic compression fractures. However, the economic value of PVP has never been evaluated in Japan where universal health care system is adopted. METHODS: We prospectively followed up 163 patients with acute vertebral osteoporotic compression fractures, 44 males aged 76.4+/-6.0 years and 119 females aged 76.8+/-7.1 years, who underwent PVP. To measure health-related QOL and pain during 52 weeks observation, we used the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D), the Rolland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMD), the 8-item Short-Form health survey (SF-8), and visual analogue scale (VAS). Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were calculated using the change of health utility of EQ-5D. The direct medical cost was calculated by accounting system of the hospital and Japanese health insurance system. Cost-effectiveness was analyzed using incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): Delta medical cost/Delta QALY. RESULTS: After PVP, improvement in EQ-5D, RMD, SF-8, and VAS scores were observed. The gain of QALY until 52 weeks was 0.162. The estimated lifetime gain of QALY reached 1.421. The direct medical cost for PVP was yen286,740 (about 3061 US dollars). Cost-effectiveness analysis using ICER showed that lifetime medical cost for a gain of 1 QALY was yen201,748 (about 2154 US dollars).

17259,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Surgical versus Medical Treatment of Prolactinomas,"Background Few studies address the cost of treating prolactinomas. We performed a cost-utility analysis of surgical versus medical treatment for prolactinomas. Materials and Methods We determined total hospital costs for surgically and medically treated prolactinoma patients. Decision-tree analysis was performed to determine which treatment produced the highest quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Outcome data were derived from published studies. Results Average total costs for surgical patients were $19,224 ( +/- 18,920). Average cost for the first year of bromocriptine or cabergoline treatment was $3,935 and $6,042, with $2,622 and $4,729 for each additional treatment year. For a patient diagnosed with prolactinoma at 40 years of age, surgery has the lowest lifetime cost ($40,473), followed by bromocriptine ($41,601) and cabergoline ($70,696). Surgery also appears to generate high health state utility and thus more QALYs. In sensitivity analyses, surgery appears to be a cost-effective treatment option for prolactinomas across a range of ages, medical/surgical costs, and medical/surgical response rates, except when surgical cure rates are </= 30%.

17261,Cost-Utility Analysis of High Molecular Weight Hyaluronic Acid for Knee Osteoarthritis in Everyday Clinical Care in Patients at a Working Age: An Economic Evaluation of a Randomized Clinical Trial,"Objectives Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with high medical costs and especially with high productivity costs, in particular in patients in their working years. High molecular weight (HMW) hyaluronic acid (HA) is an alternative treatment for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are known for their serious side-effects. The cost-utility of intra-articular HMW-HA treatment in these patients is unknown though and was assessed in this study. Methods Secondary care patients between 18 and 65 with knee OA were randomized to usual care (UC) + HMW-HA (intervention group) or UC only (control group). A cost-utility analysis over 52 weeks from the societal and healthcare perspective was performed. Uncertainty for costs, effects and cost-utility ratio was analysed by non-parametric bootstrapping. Baseline imbalance adjustment was done by inversed probability of treatment weighting. Results In total, 156 subjects were included (intervention group 77, control group 79). The total of productivity and medical costs was euro475 higher in the intervention group (euro7.754, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) euro5.426; euro10.436 versus euro7.270, euro95%CI euro5.453; euro9.262). The amount of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained during follow-up was also higher in the intervention group (0.779 versus 0.727). This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro9.100/QALY from a societal perspective and euro8.700/QALY from a healthcare perspective. When the maximum willingness to pay for similar conditions to knee OA is considered, the probability on cost-effectiveness is 64% and 86% from both perspectives respectively, Conclusion Intra-articular HMW-HA added to usual care for knee OA is probably cost-effective in the treatment of knee OA.

17263,Cost-utility analyses of cataract surgery in vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy,"PURPOSE: To explore the cost utility of cataract surgery in patients with stabilized vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (DR). SETTING: Department of Ophthalmology, Shanghai General Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. DESIGN: Prospective case series. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with cataracts combined with stabilized vision-threatening DR had successful phacoemulsification with foldable posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. The corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and utility value obtained using the time tradeoff method at 3-month postoperative intervals were compared with those preoperative values. The cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was calculated using the bootstrap method. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The study comprised 126 patients (153 eyes). All surgeries were successful. The weighted logMAR CDVA changed from 0.82 logMAR +/- 0.34 (SD) to 0.58 +/- 0.30 logMAR (P < .001). The utility values increased from 0.58 +/- 0.14 to 0.72 +/- 0.14 (P < .001). The gain in utility values was correlated with the postoperative weighted logMAR CDVA, the change between the postoperative and preoperative weighted logMAR CDVA, performance of bilateral cataract surgery, and duration of DR or diabetic macular edema. The patients gained 1.50 quality-adjusted life years by cataract surgery. The cost per quality-adjusted life year was US $768. This surgery was cost-effective at the threshold of US $22 526 per quality-adjusted life year in China. The cost per quality-adjusted life year varied from US $630 to US $8707 in sensitivity analyses.

17264,Long-term outcomes and cost effectiveness of high-dose dexamethasone for cardiac surgery: a randomised trial,"Prophylactic intra-operative administration of dexamethasone may improve short-term clinical outcomes in cardiac surgical patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate long-term clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness of dexamethasone versus placebo. Patients included in the multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled DExamethasone for Cardiac Surgery (DECS) trial were followed up for 12 months after their cardiac surgical procedure. In the DECS trial, patients received a single intra-operative dose of dexamethasone 1 mg.kg-1 (n = 2239) or placebo (n = 2255). The effects on the incidence of major postoperative events were evaluated. Also, overall costs for the 12-month postoperative period, and cost effectiveness, were compared between groups. Of 4494 randomised patients, 4457 patients (99%) were followed up until 12 months after surgery. There was no difference in the incidence of major postoperative events, the relative risk (95%CI) being 0.86 (0.72-1.03); p = 0.1. Treatment with dexamethasone reduced costs per patient by pound921 [euro1084] (95%CI pound-1672 to -137; p = 0.02), mainly through reduction of postoperative respiratory failure and duration of postoperative hospital stay. The probability of dexamethasone being cost effective compared with placebo was 97% at a threshold value of pound17,000 [euro20,000] per quality-adjusted life year. We conclude that intra-operative high-dose dexamethasone did not have an effect on major adverse events at 12 months after cardiac surgery, but was associated with a reduction in costs.

17265,Cost-effectiveness of cerebrospinal biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: Accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer''s disease (AD) is important for prompt initiation of treatment in patients with AD and to avoid inappropriate treatment of patients with false-positive diagnoses. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we estimated the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis in a cohort of patients referred to a neurologist or memory clinic with suspected AD who remained without a definitive diagnosis of AD or another condition after neuroimaging. Parametric values were estimated from previous health economic models and the medical literature. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. RESULTS: At a 12.7% pretest probability of AD, biomarker analysis after normal neuroimaging findings has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $11,032 per QALY gained. Results were sensitive to the pretest prevalence of AD, and the ICER increased to over $50,000 per QALY when the prevalence of AD fell below 9%. Results were also sensitive to patient age (biomarkers are less cost-effective in older cohorts), treatment uptake and adherence, biomarker test characteristics, and the degree to which patients with suspected AD who do not have AD benefit from AD treatment when they are falsely diagnosed. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of biomarker analysis depends critically on the prevalence of AD in the tested population. In general practice, where the prevalence of AD after clinical assessment and normal neuroimaging findings may be low, biomarker analysis is unlikely to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained. However, when at least 1 in 11 patients has AD after normal neuroimaging findings, biomarker analysis is likely cost-effective. Specifically, for patients referred to memory clinics with memory impairment who do not present neuroimaging evidence of medial temporal lobe atrophy, pretest prevalence of AD may exceed 15%. Biomarker analysis is a potentially cost-saving diagnostic method and should be considered for adoption in high-prevalence centers.",2017-01-23565,28302164,Alzheimers Res Ther,Spencer A W Lee,2017,9 / 1,18,No,28302164,"Spencer A W Lee; Luciano A Sposato; Vladimir Hachinski; Lauren E Cipriano; Cost-effectiveness of cerebrospinal biomarkers for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, Alzheimers Res Ther, 2017 Mar 16; 9(1):1758-9193; 18",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers screening for Alzheimer's disease including a lumbar puncture vs. None,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,11032,United States,2013,12256.35

Materials and Methods A decision-analytic model was constructed to compare cost and effectiveness of three diagnostic strategies for gallstone disease with possible choledocholithiasis: noncontrast MR cholangiopancreatography, contrast material-enhanced MR imaging/MR cholangiopancreatography, and ASGE risk stratification guidelines for diagnostic evaluation recommending endoscopy (high risk), MR cholangiopancreatography (intermediate risk), or no test (low risk). Analysis was performed from a U.S. health system perspective over 1-year and lifetime horizons. The model accounted for benign and malignant causes of biliary obstruction and procedural complications. Cost information was based on Medicare reimbursements. Sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of parameter variability on model results. Results Noncontrast MR cholangiopancreatography was most cost-effective in 45-55-year-old patients (less than $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained), while contrast-enhanced MR imaging was favored in younger adults. Risk-stratified testing was less costly than MR cholangiopancreatography, with long-term savings of $1870 and $2068 versus noncontrast and contrast-enhanced MR cholangiopancreatography, respectively, but was also less effective (-0.1814, -0.1831 QALY, respectively). The lifetime incremental cost per QALY for noncontrast MR cholangiopancreatography was $10 311. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging was favored with pretest probabilities of biliary stricture or malignancy 0%-73% for patients aged 20-44 years. For patients older than 55 years, ASGE guidelines maximized QALYs at the lowest cost. Conclusion Although adults older than 55 years of age are optimally evaluated by using ASGE guidelines, younger patients suspected of having acute biliary obstruction likely benefit from MR cholangiopancreatography rather than risk-stratified diagnostic imaging because of improved detection of choledocholithiasis and alternative causes of biliary obstruction.

17274,Economic evaluation of nivolumab as a second-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma from US and Chinese perspectives,"BACKGROUND: Nivolumab is a new standard of care for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and provides an overall survival benefit of 5.40 months in comparison with everolimus. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab for the second-line treatment of mRCC from the perspective of US payers and identified the range of drug costs for which the addition of nivolumab to standard therapy could be considered cost-effective from a Chinese perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was constructed to estimate lifetime costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs were estimated for the US and Chinese health care systems. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Nivolumab provided an additional 0.29 QALYs at a cost of $151,676/QALY in the United States. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, at the current cost of nivolumab, the chance of nivolumab being cost-effective was 3.10%. For China, when nivolumab cost less than $7.90 or $9.70/mg, there was a nearly 90% likelihood that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for nivolumab would be less than $22,785 or $48,838/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: For the United States, nivolumab is unlikely to be a high-value treatment for mRCC at the current price, and a price reduction appears to be justified. In China, value-based prices for nivolumab are $7.90 and $9.70/mg for the country and Beijing City, respectively.

The aim of this study is to estimate whether the additional benefits of FIT screening compared to gFOBT outweigh the additional costs and harms. METHODS: We used microsimulation modeling to estimate quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs of gFOBT and FIT, compared to no screening, in a cohort of screening participants. We compared strategies with various age ranges, screening intervals, and cut-off levels for FIT. Cost-efficient strategies were determined for various levels of available colonoscopy capacity. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, biennial gFOBT screening between age 50-74 years provided 20 QALYs at a cost of CAN$200,900 per 1,000 participants, and required 17 colonoscopies per 1,000 participants per year. FIT screening was more effective and less costly. For the same level of colonoscopy requirement, biennial FIT (with a high cut-off level of 200 ng Hb/ml) between age 50-74 years provided 11 extra QALYs gained while saving CAN$333,300 per 1000 participants, compared to gFOBT.

METHODS: We used microsimulation modeling to estimate quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs of gFOBT and FIT, compared to no screening, in a cohort of screening participants. We compared strategies with various age ranges, screening intervals, and cut-off levels for FIT. Cost-efficient strategies were determined for various levels of available colonoscopy capacity. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, biennial gFOBT screening between age 50-74 years provided 20 QALYs at a cost of CAN$200,900 per 1,000 participants, and required 17 colonoscopies per 1,000 participants per year. FIT screening was more effective and less costly. For the same level of colonoscopy requirement, biennial FIT (with a high cut-off level of 200 ng Hb/ml) between age 50-74 years provided 11 extra QALYs gained while saving CAN$333,300 per 1000 participants, compared to gFOBT. Without restrictions in colonoscopy capacity, FIT (with a low cut-off level of 50 ng Hb/ml) every year between age 45-80 years was the most cost-effective strategy providing 27 extra QALYs gained per 1000 participants, while saving CAN$448,300.

The aim of this study is to estimate whether the additional benefits of FIT screening compared to gFOBT outweigh the additional costs and harms. METHODS: We used microsimulation modeling to estimate quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs of gFOBT and FIT, compared to no screening, in a cohort of screening participants. We compared strategies with various age ranges, screening intervals, and cut-off levels for FIT. Cost-efficient strategies were determined for various levels of available colonoscopy capacity. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, biennial gFOBT screening between age 50-74 years provided 20 QALYs at a cost of CAN$200,900 per 1,000 participants, and required 17 colonoscopies per 1,000 participants per year.

17300,Prevention of renal failure in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the second leading cause (16.4%) of end-stage renal disease in China. The current study assessed the cost-effectiveness of preventing DKD in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes from the Chinese healthcare perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov decision model was developed according to the disease course of DKD. Patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes might receive treatment according to one of the following three strategies: (i) ""do nothing"" strategy (control strategy); (ii) treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (universal strategy); (iii) or screening for microalbuminuria followed by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker treatment (screening strategy). Clinical and utility data were obtained from the published literature. Direct medical costs and resource utilization in the Chinese healthcare setting were considered. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken to test the impact of a range of variables and assumptions on the results. RESULTS: Compared with the control strategy, both the screening and universal strategies were cost-saving options that showed lower costs and better health benefits. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the universal strategy over the screening strategy was US $30,087 per quality-adjusted life-year, which was higher than the cost-effectiveness threshold of China. The sensitivity analyses showed robust results, except for the probability of developing macroalbuminuria from microalbuminuria. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for microalbuminuria could be a cost-saving option for the prevention of DKD in the Chinese setting.",2017-01-23578,28296280,J Diabetes Investig,Bin Wu,2017,/,,No,28296280,"Bin Wu; Suhua Zhang; Houwen Lin; Shan Mou; Prevention of renal failure in Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes: A cost-effectiveness analysis, J Diabetes Investig, 2017 May 11; ():2040-1116",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal strategy: treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers vs. None,Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-7697,United States,2014,-8414.72
