4101,Cost-effectiveness of screening for pre-diabetes among overweight and obese U.S. adults,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening overweight and obese individuals for pre-diabetes and then modifying their lifestyle based on the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov simulation model was used to estimate disease progression, costs, and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a health care system perspective. We considered two screening/treatment strategies for pre-diabetes. Strategy 1 included screening overweight subjects and giving them the lifestyle intervention included in the DPP if they were diagnosed with both impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG). Strategy 2 included screening followed by lifestyle intervention for subjects diagnosed with either IGT or IFG or both. Each strategy was compared with a program of no screening. RESULTS: Screening for pre-diabetes and treating those identified as having both IGT and IFG with the DPP lifestyle intervention had a cost-effectiveness ratio of $8,181 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) relative to no screening. If treatment was also provided to subjects with only IGT or only IFG (strategy 2), the cost-effectiveness ratio increased to $9,511 per QALY. Changes in screening-related parameters had small effects on the cost-effectiveness ratios; the results were more sensitive to changes in intervention-related parameters.

4103,Modeling the economic and health consequences of managing chronic osteoarthritis pain with opioids in Germany: comparison of extended-release oxycodone and OROS hydromorphone,"OBJECTIVE: The Osmotic controlled-Release Oral delivery System (OROS) hydromorphone ensures continuous release of hydromorphone over 24 hours. It is anticipated that this will facilitate optimal pain relief, improve quality of sleep and compliance. This simulation compared managing chronic osteoarthritis pain with once-daily OROS hydromorphone with an equianalgesic dose of extended-release (ER) oxycodone administered two or three times a day. METHODS: This discrete event simulation follows patients for a year after initiating opioid treatment. Pairs of identical patients are created; one receives OROS hydromorphone the other ER oxycodone; undergo dose adjustments and after titration can be dissatisfied or satisfied, suffer adverse events, pain recurrence, or discontinue the opioid. Each is assigned an initial sleep problems score, and an improved score from a treatment dependent distribution at the end of titration; these are translated to a utility value. Utilities are assigned pre-treatment, updated until the patient reaches the optimal dose or is non-compliant or dissatisfied. The OROS hydromorphone and ER oxycodone doses are converted to equianalgesic morphine doses using the following ratios: hydromorphone to morphine ratio; 1:5, oxycodone to morphine ratio; 1:2. Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty in the conversion ratios and other key parameters. Direct medical costs are in 2005 euros. RESULTS: Over 1 year on a mean daily morphine-equivalent dose of 90 mg, 14% were estimated to be dissatisfied with each opioid. OROS hydromorphone was predicted to yield 0.017 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)/patient for a small additional annual cost (E141/patient), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of E8343/QALY gained. Changing the assumed conversion ratio for oxycodone:morphine to 1:1.5 led to lower net costs of E68 per patient, E3979/QALY, and for hydromorphone to 1:7.5 to savings. CONCLUSION: Based on these analyses, OROS hydromorphone is expected to yield health benefits at reasonable cost in Germany.",2007-01-03151,17697453,Curr Med Res Opin,Alexandra Ward,2007,23 / 10,2333-45,No,17697453,"Alexandra Ward; Duygu Bozkaya; Jochen Fleischmann; Dominique Dubois; Rainer Sabatowski; J Jaime Caro; Modeling the economic and health consequences of managing chronic osteoarthritis pain with opioids in Germany: comparison of extended-release oxycodone and OROS hydromorphone, Curr Med Res Opin, 2007-Oct; 23(10):0300-7995; 2333-45",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,OROS (Osmotic-controlled Release Oral-delivery System) hydromorphone vs. ER (extended release) Oxycodone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,8343,Euro,2005,13763.44
4104,Intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel versus intravenous carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy for Stage III ovarian cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy as front-line treatment for patients with Stage III epithelial ovarian cancer following optimal primary cytoreductive surgery. METHODS: Based on Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols #172 and #158, a decision analysis model was created to compare two treatment strategies for patients with optimal residual disease Stage III ovarian cancer: (1) inpatient intravenous paclitaxel (24 h) and intraperitoneal cisplatin plus outpatient intraperitoneal paclitaxel chemotherapy (IP/IV), and (2) outpatient intravenous paclitaxel (3 h) and carboplatin chemotherapy (IV/IV). The cost-effectiveness of each strategy was evaluated from the perspective of society. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that the strategy of IP/IV chemotherapy had an overall cost per patient of $39,861 and effectiveness of 5.16 QALYs compared to $18,822 and 4.59 QALYs for IV/IV chemotherapy. The IP/IV chemotherapy strategy was associated with an additional 0.56 QALYs at an incremental cost of $21,039. The incremental C/E ratio for IP/IV chemotherapy was $37,454/QALY. Inpatient treatment accounted for 43.2% of the cost of IP/IV chemotherapy. Sensitivity analysis testing confirmed the robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, IP/IV chemotherapy was associated with a modest extension in quality-adjusted survival time but was also more costly than IV/IV chemotherapy. On balance, the IP/IV strategy can be considered a good healthcare value. However, these data also suggest that efforts to reduce the cost of IP/IV chemotherapy, such as through development of an ambulatory regimen with equivalent therapeutic efficacy but an improved toxicity profile, would improve the overall value of this adjuvant treatment program.",2007-01-03157,17688927,Gynecol Oncol,Robert E Bristow,2007,106 / 3,476-81,No,17688927,"Robert E Bristow; Antonio Santillan; Ritu Salani; Teresa P Diaz-Montes; Robert L Giuntoli; Benjamin C Meisner; Deborah K Armstrong; Kevin D Frick; Intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel versus intravenous carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy for Stage III ovarian cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Gynecol Oncol, 2007-Sep; 106(3):0090-8258; 476-81",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Inpatient intravenous paclitaxel (24 h) and intraperitoneal cisplatin plus outpatient intraperitoneal paclitaxel chemotherapy (IP/IV) vs. Outpatient intravenous paclitaxel (3 h) and carboplatin chemotherapy (IV/IV),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Months,Not Stated,3.00,37454,United States,2006,48082.87
4105,Is laparoscopic colectomy for cancer cost-effective relative to open colectomy?,"BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic-assisted colectomy (LAC) for cancer has been shown to be safe, with equivalent long-term survival rates to conventional open colectomy (OC) and better short-term patient outcomes. However, LAC tends to require more operating theatre time and disposable equipment. This study investigated, in the context of the New Zealand public hospital system, the extent to which LAC for cancer is cost-effective relative to OC. METHODS: Estimates of the hospital resources used and patient recovery times for LAC and OC for colorectal cancer were obtained from a meta-analysis of published international randomized controlled trials. Using prices from a representative New Zealand public hospital, the additional resources for LAC (relative to OC) were summed to obtain an estimate of LAC's total incremental (additional) cost. The recovery time savings from LAC were also represented in quality-adjusted life years (QALY), enabling a cost-utility analysis of LAC, which was subjected to a one-way sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: On average, a LAC costs New Zealand public hospitals $1267 (range: $259-$3808; all dollars referred to are New Zealand dollars) more than an OC. Average recovery time savings of 12 and 33 days (from two randomized controlled trials) translate into QALY gains of 0.018 and 0.049. Thus, relative to an OC, an LAC costs $38 and $106 per recovery day saved, or $70 389 and $25 857 (combined range: $14 389-$211 556) per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: LAC for cancer appears to be cost-effective relative to OC (per recovery day saved and QALY gained, respectively) for the lower of the average cost estimates and is probably not cost-effective for the higher estimate.

4106,Cost-effectiveness of bone densitometry followed by treatment of osteoporosis in older men,"CONTEXT: Osteoporotic fractures are common among elderly men. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate among older men the cost-effectiveness of bone densitometry followed by 5 years of oral bisphosphonate therapy to prevent fractures for those found to have osteoporosis (femoral neck T score < or =-2.5), compared with no intervention. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Computer Markov microsimulation model using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon. Simulations were performed for hypothetical cohorts of white men aged 65, 70, 75, 80, or 85 years, with or without prior clinical fracture. Data sources for model parameters included the Rochester Epidemiology Project for fracture costs and population-based age-specific fracture rates; the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men (MrOS) study and published meta-analyses for the associations among prior fractures, bone density, and incident fractures; and published studies of fracture disutility. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for the densitometry and follow-up treatment strategy compared with no intervention, calculated from lifetime costs and accumulated QALYs for each strategy. RESULTS: Lifetime costs per QALY gained for the densitometry and follow-up treatment strategy were less than $50,000 for men aged 65 years or older with a prior clinical fracture and for men aged 80 years or older without a prior fracture. These results were most sensitive to oral bisphosphonate cost and fracture reduction efficacy, the strength of association between bone mineral density and fractures, fracture rates and disutility, and medication adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Bone densitometry followed by bisphosphonate therapy for those with osteoporosis may be cost-effective for men aged 65 years or older with a self-reported prior clinical fracture and for men aged 80 to 85 years with no prior fracture.

4109,Cost-effectiveness of a nurse-led telemonitoring intervention based on peak expiratory flow measurements in asthmatics: results of a randomised controlled trial,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Asthma is a chronic lung disease in which recurrent asthma symptoms create a substantial burden to individuals and their families. At the same time the economic burden associated with asthma is considerable. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness study was part of a single centre prospective randomised controlled trial comparing a nurse-led telemonitoring programme to usual care in a population of asthmatic outpatients. The study included 109 asthmatic outpatients (56 children; 53 adults). The duration of follow-up was 12 months, and measurements were performed at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 months. Patients were asked to transfer their monitor data at least twice daily and by judging the received data and following a stepwise intervention protocol a nurse was able to act as the main caregiver in the intervention group. In both groups the EQ-5D and the SF-6D were used to obtain estimates of health state utilities. One year health care costs, patient and family costs, and productivity losses were calculated. The mean incremental costs were weighted against the mean incremental effect in terms of QALY. RESULTS: The study population generally represented mild to moderate asthmatics. No significant differences were found between the groups with regard to the generic quality of life. Overall, the mean health care costs per patient were higher in the intervention group than in the control group. The intervention costs mainly caused the cost difference between the groups. The intervention costs the society euro 31,035/QALY gained with regard to adults and with regard to children euro 59,071/QALY gained. CONCLUSION: If the outcome is measured by generic quality of life the nurse-led telemonitoring programme is of limited cost-effectiveness in the study population. From the societal perspective the probability of the programme being cost-effective compared to regular care was 85% at a ceiling ratio of euro 80,000/QALY gained among the adults and 68% among the children. A decrease in the price of the asthma monitor will substantial increase the probability of the programme to be cost-effective.

DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using published literature. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of patients aged 60 to 80 with PHN. INTERVENTIONS: Desipramine 100 mg/d, gabapentin 1,800 mg/d, and pregabalin 450 mg/d. MEASUREMENTS: A decision model was designed to describe possible treatment outcomes, including different combinations of analgesia and side effects, during the first 3 months of therapy for moderate to severe PHN. The main outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Costs were estimated using the perspective of a third-party payer. Multivariate, univariate, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, and the time frame of the model was varied to 1-month and 6-month horizons. RESULTS: Desipramine was more effective and less expensive than gabapentin or pregabalin (dominant) under all conditions tested. Gabapentin was more effective than pregabalin but at an incremental cost of $216,000/QALY.

4113,"A cost-effectiveness comparison of desipramine, gabapentin, and pregabalin for treating postherpetic neuralgia","OBJECTIVES: To compare the net health effects and costs resulting from treatment with different first-line postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) medications. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using published literature. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of patients aged 60 to 80 with PHN. INTERVENTIONS: Desipramine 100 mg/d, gabapentin 1,800 mg/d, and pregabalin 450 mg/d. MEASUREMENTS: A decision model was designed to describe possible treatment outcomes, including different combinations of analgesia and side effects, during the first 3 months of therapy for moderate to severe PHN. The main outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Costs were estimated using the perspective of a third-party payer. Multivariate, univariate, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, and the time frame of the model was varied to 1-month and 6-month horizons. RESULTS: Desipramine was more effective and less expensive than gabapentin or pregabalin (dominant) under all conditions tested. Gabapentin was more effective than pregabalin but at an incremental cost of $216,000/QALY. Below $140/month, gabapentin became more cost-effective than pregabalin at a threshold of $50,000/QALY, and below $115/month gabapentin dominated pregabalin.

4114,Cost effectiveness and cost utility of an organized screening programme for glaucoma,"PURPOSE: To assess the cost effectiveness and cost utility of an organized screening programme for glaucoma. The previous cost-effectiveness studies of screening show inconsistent results, and the cost utility of screening has not been assessed. METHODS: An organized screening programme was simulated using Markov modelling in a population aged 50-79 years at 5 year intervals. The programme ended when the subjects reached the age of 80 years. The comparator was opportunistic case finding. The main outcome measures were cases and years of severe visual disability avoided, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and direct healthcare and non-healthcare costs. RESULTS: The incremental cost of 1 year of avoided visual disability by screening was euro32 602. The cost of one QALY gained by screening was euro9023 with a discount rate of 5%. During the average 20 year time horizon considered, the cumulative incremental costs of screening in a population of 1 million people would be euro30 million, producing 3360 incremental QALYs and 930 years of avoided visual disability for 701 persons. The results were sensitive to the estimates of several parameters, especially screening cost and specificity of screening tests (96-99% specificity required). CONCLUSION: An organized screening programme could be a cost-effective strategy especially in older age groups, in which screening is clearly more likely to be acceptable to decision makers at any level in terms of their willingness to pay for a QALY.

4115,Treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms: decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: To prospectively perform a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis of surgical and endovascular treatments of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, with incorporation of the results of the prospective International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With use of a Markov model, a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for comparison of surgical or endovascular treatment with no treatment. Twelve clinical scenarios were defined on the basis of aneurysm size and location. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for 50- and 40-year-old patient cohorts. Treatment was considered to be cost-effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: In 50-year-old patients, no treatment was the most cost-effective strategy for aneurysms located in the cavernous carotid artery. For aneurysms smaller than 7 mm located in the anterior circulation, no treatment was the most cost-effective strategy. Endovascular treatment was the most cost-effective option for 7-24-mm aneurysms, whereas surgical treatment was the most cost-effective option for aneurysms 25 mm or larger.

However, discussions as to giving immediately a treatment (direct treatment) to these patients have started and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of such strategy is still unknown. The aim of this study was to estimate, in the health care payer perspective, the ICER of a direct treatment of patients with mild chronic hepatitis C in comparison with the strategy of monitoring these patients and treat them when the disease will progress to the state of moderate chronic hepatitis. The treatment assessed was the current standard treatment composed of pegylated interferon alpha-2a and ribavirin. At the beginning of the study, patients were aged 45. Long-term economic and clinical outcomes over a 30-year period were predicted using a Markov simulation model. Data were obtained from published literature. Monte Carlo simulations were used to determine 95% confidence intervals of results. The ICER of a direct treatment with PEG IFN alpha-2a and ribavirin is 23,046 euro/QALY (CI 95% 3,882 euro-42,392 euro) for genotypes 1-4-5-6 and 4,631 euro/QALY (CI 95% 797 euro-7,881 euro) for genotypes 2-3. Sensitivity analysis shows that it is only in extreme circumstances related to the utilities that the ICER for genotypes 1-4-5-6 is unacceptably high for the society (>50,000 euro).

4123,Assessing differences in utility scores: a comparison of four widely used preference-based instruments,"OBJECTIVES: To characterize the differences in utility scores (dUTY) among four commonly used preference-based Health-Related Quality of Life instruments, to evaluate the potential impact of these differences on cost-utility analyses (CUA), and to determine if sociodemographic/clinical factors influenced the magnitude of these differences. METHODS: Consenting adult Chinese, Malay and Indian subjects in Singapore were interviewed using Singapore English, Chinese, Malay or Tamil versions of the EQ-5D, Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3), and SF-6D. Agreement between instruments was assessed using Bland-Altman (BA) plots. Changes in incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) from dUTY were investigated using eight hypothetical decision trees. The influence of sociodemographic/clinical factors on dUTY between instrument pairs was studied using multiple linear regression (MLR) models for English-speaking subjects (circumventing structural zero issues). RESULTS: In 667 subjects (median age 48 years, 59% female), median utility scores ranged from 0.80 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80, 0.85) for the EQ-5D to 0.89 (95% CI 0.88, 0.89) for the SF-6D. BA plots: Mean differences (95% CI) exceeded the clinically important difference (CID) of 0.04 for four of six pairwise comparisons, with the exception of the HUI2/EQ-5D (0.03, CI: 0.02, 0.04) and SF-6D/HUI2 (0.02, CI: 0.006, 0.02). Decision trees: The ICER ranged from $94,661/QALY (quality-adjusted life-year; 6.3% difference from base case) to 100,693 dollars/QALY (0.3% difference from base case). MLR: Chronic medical conditions, marital status, and Family Functioning Measures scores significantly (P-value < 0.05) influenced dUTY for several instrument pairs.

4124,Economic evaluation of tegaserod vs. placebo in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome: an analysis of the TENOR study,"OBJECTIVES: Tegaserod is effective, safe, and well-tolerated in the treatment of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation. The aim of this study was to assess, from a payer perspective, the cost-effectiveness of tegaserod in the treatment of IBS patients, based on the TEgaserod in NORdic region (TENOR) trial data. METHODS: Female and male patients (Rome II criteria) were randomized to receive tegaserod 6 mg b.i.d. or placebo for 12 weeks. Patients (247 tegaserod; 238 placebo) completed the EuroQol EQ-5D questionnaire at baseline, Week 4, and Week 12. A 12-week economic study was undertaken to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of tegaserod in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were calculated to estimate the probability of tegaserod being cost-effective at different benchmark values of cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: By assuming a daily drug cost to payers of Euro 2, Euro 3, and Euro 4, the ICER of tegaserod ranges between Euro 19,000 and Euro 38,000 per QALY gained, with the percentage of the bootstrap estimates below the willingness to pay level of Euro 50,000 per QALY gained ranging between 90% and 69%.

4126,Quality of life and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture treatment in patients with osteoarthritis pain,"To assess quality of life (QoL), costs, and cost-effectiveness of acupuncture treatment plus routine care versus routine care alone in osteoarthritis patients, a randomised, controlled trial was conducted in 255 general practices in Germany. Four hundred and eighty-nine patients with chronic pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee or hip were included to evaluated QoL and costs at baseline and after 3 months using health insurance funds data and standardized questionnaires. Patients receiving acupuncture had an improved QoL associated with significantly higher costs over the 3 months treatment period compared to routine care alone (mean cost-difference: <euro>469.50 [95%CI <euro>135.80-<euro>803.19]). This increase in costs was primarily due to the costs of acupuncture. The overall ICER was <euro>17,845 per QALY gained.

4127,Cost-effectiveness of Spa treatment for fibromyalgia: general health improvement is not for free,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of an adjuvant treatment course of spa treatment compared with usual care only in patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FM). METHODS: 134 patients with FM, selected from a rheumatology outpatient department and from members of the Dutch FM patient association were randomly assigned to a 2(1/2) week spa treatment course in Tunisia or to usual care only. Results are expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for a 6-month as well as a 12-month time horizon. Utilities were derived form the Short Form 6D (SF-6D) scores and the visual analogue scale (VAS) rating general health. Costs were reported from societal perspective. Mean incremental cost per patient and the incremental cost utility ratio (ICER) were calculated; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using double-sided bootstrapping. RESULTS: The data of 128 (55 spa and 73 controls) of the 134 patients (96%) could be used for analysis. Improvement in general health was found in the spa group until 6 months of follow-up by both the SF-6D (AUC 0.32 vs 0.30, P < 0.05) and the VAS (AUC 0.23 vs 0.19, P < 0.01). After 1yr no significant between-group differences were found. Mean incremental cost of spa treatment was 1311 Euro per patient (95% CI 369-2439), equalling the cost of the intervention (thalassotherapy including airfare and lodging), or 885 Euro per patient based on a more realistic cost estimate.

4128,Cost-effectiveness of suppressing hepatitis B virus DNA in immune tolerant patients to prevent hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis,"BACKGROUND: For patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the immune tolerant phase, the current standard of care is to not offer treatment. However, the recent Risk Evaluation of the Viral Load Elevation and Associated Liver Disease/Cancer-In study results show a striking relationship between high HBV DNA levels and risk for hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. AIM: In a cost effectiveness analysis, to assess whether immune tolerant patients with high HBV DNA levels should undergo treatment. METHODS: We created a lifetime Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of two strategies for immune tolerant hepatitis B: (i) HBV DNA suppression with lamivudine, (ii) no treatment. Patients cycled between the following health states: viral suppression, ongoing viremia, seroconversion, hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhosis and death. RESULTS: Compared with the no treatment strategy, lamivudine therapy was more expensive but more cost-effective with an additional cost of $5784 and $12 584 per quality adjusted life year gained in males and females, respectively. Treatment resulted in a gain in life expectancy and a decrease in lifetime risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis.

4130,Cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alpha-2a compared with lamivudine treatment in patients with HBe-antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Peginterferon alpha-2a (40 kDa), a new treatment for chronic hepatitis B, produces seroconversion within 48 weeks in approximately 32% of HBeAg-positive patients. Over a defined treatment duration it offers improved efficacy over lamivudine, but at higher cost. We assessed the clinical outcomes and costs, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service, of 48 weeks of peginterferon alpha-2a (40 kDa) vs. 4 years of lamivudine. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was analysed using a state-transition Markov model simulating HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B natural history. Efficacy data were obtained from a large randomized trial comparing peginterferon alpha-2a (40 kDa) with lamivudine over 48 weeks. Use of adefovir salvage treatment for lamivudine-resistant patients was also evaluated. Long-term lamivudine efficacy, treatment durability, disease progression, cost, and quality-of-life estimates were derived from the literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. RESULTS: Treatment with peginterferon alpha-2a (40 kDa) for 48 weeks resulted in higher discounted total healthcare costs ( pound 3100), but an increase of 0.3 discounted quality-adjusted life years compared with long-term lamivudine, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound 10,400 per quality-adjusted life year gained ( pound 8300- pound 15,400 in one-way sensitivity analyses). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed intervention was below the pound 30,000/QALY threshold in over 95% of the simulations. When adefovir was included for patients with lamivudine resistance, peginterferon alpha-2a (40 kDa) had an incremental cost of pound 6100/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with peginterferon alpha-2a (40 kDa) for a defined duration of 48 weeks, although more expensive than lamivudine therapy, provides improvement in health outcomes, with a cost-effectiveness ratio well below the current UK cost-effectiveness threshold.",2007-01-03210,17625431,Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol,David L Veenstra,2007,19 / 8,631-8,No,17625431,"David L Veenstra; Sean D Sullivan; Geoffry M Dusheiko; Michael Jacobs; Julia E Aledort; Gavin Lewis; Kavita K Patel; Cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alpha-2a compared with lamivudine treatment in patients with HBe-antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B in the United Kingdom, Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2007-Aug; 19(8):0954-691X; 631-8",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Peginterferon a-2a 180 mg monotherapy for 48 weeks vs. Lamivudine 100 mg monotherapy up to a maximum of 4 years or until patients achieve HBeAg seroconversion,Not Stated,32 Years,32 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,1.50,10444,United Kingdom,2005,25194.61
4131,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of anastrozole vs tamoxifen in adjuvant therapy for early stage breast cancer in the United Kingdom: the 5-year completed treatment analysis of the ATAC ('Arimidex', Tamoxifen alone or in combination) trial","Results from the completed treatment analysis of the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen alone or in combination) trial indicated that anastrozole was significantly superior to tamoxifen in terms of efficacy and safety in the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early breast cancer. On the basis of these results, this study estimated the cost-effectiveness of anastrozole vs tamoxifen, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS). A Markov model was developed using the 5-year completed treatment analysis from the ATAC trial (ISRCTN18233230), as well as data obtained from published literature and expert opinion. Resource utilisation data and associated costs (2003-4 UK pound) were compiled from standard sources and expert opinion. Utility scores for a number of health states were obtained from a cross-sectional study of 26 representative patients using the standard gamble technique. The utility scores were then inserted into the model to obtain cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Costs and benefits were discounted at recommended annual rates of the UK Treasury (3.5%). Modelled for 25 years, anastrozole, relative to generic tamoxifen, was estimated to result in 0.244 QALYs gained per patient at an additional cost of pound4315 per patient). The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen was pound17 656 per QALY gained. There was a greater than 90% probability that the cost-effectiveness of anastrozole was below pound30 000 per QALY gained and of the order of 65% that it was below pound20 000 per QALY gained. The results were robust to all parameters tested in sensitivity analysis.

4132,Cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for initiating and monitoring highly active antiretroviral therapy in the developing world,"OBJECTIVE: Determine the cost-effectiveness of initiating and monitoring highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in developing countries according to developing world versus developed world guidelines. DESIGN: Lifetime Markov model incorporating costs, quality of life, survival, and transmission to sexual contacts. METHODS: We evaluated treating patients with HIV in South Africa according to World Health Organization (WHO) ""3 by 5"" guidelines (treat CD4 counts <or=200 cells/mm or patients with AIDS, and monitor CD4 cell counts every 6 months) versus modified WHO guidelines that incorporate the following key differences from developed world guidelines: treat CD4 counts <or=350 cells/mm or viral loads >100,000 copies/mL, and monitor CD4 cell counts and viral load every 3 months. RESULTS: Incorporating transmission to partners (excluding indirect costs), treating patients according to developed versus developing world guidelines increased costs by US $11,867 and increased life expectancy by 3.00 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), for an incremental cost-effectiveness of $3956 per QALY. Including indirect costs, over the duration of the model, there are net cost savings to the economy of $39.4 billion, with increased direct medical costs of $60.5 billion offset by indirect cost savings of $99.9 billion.

4133,"Active exercise, education, and cognitive behavioral therapy for persistent disabling low back pain: a randomized controlled trial","STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: To determine 1) whether, among patients with persistent disabling low back pain (LBP), a group program of exercise and education using a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) approach, reduces pain and disability over a subsequent 12-month period; 2) the cost-effectiveness of the intervention; and 3) whether a priori preference for type of treatment influences outcome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is evidence that both exercise and CBT delivered in specialist settings is effective in improving LBP. There is a lack of evidence on whether such interventions, delivered by trained individuals in primary care, result in improved outcomes. METHODS: The study was conducted in nine family medical practices in East Cheshire, UK. Patients 18 to 65 years of age, consulting with LBP, were recruited; those still reporting LBP 3 months after the initial consultation were randomized between the two trial arms. The intervention arm received a program of eight 2-hour group exercise session over 6 weeks comprising active exercise and education delivered by physiotherapists using a CBT approach. Both arms received an educational booklet and audio-cassette. The primary outcome measures were pain (0-100 Visual Analogue Scale) and disability (Roland and Morris Disability Scale; score 0-24). RESULTS: A total of 196 subjects (84%) completed follow-up 12 months after the completion of the intervention program. The intervention showed only a small and nonsignificant effect at reducing pain (-3.6 mm; 95% confidence interval, -8.5, 1.2 mm) and disability (-0.6 score; 95% confidence interval, -1.6, 0.4). The cost of the intervention was low with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound5000 (U.S. $8650) per quality adjusted life year. In addition, patients allocated to the intervention that had expressed a preference for it had clinically important reductions in pain and disability. CONCLUSIONS: This intervention program produces only modest effects in reducing LBP and disability over a 1-year period. The observation that patient preference for treatment influences outcome warrants further investigation.",2007-01-03216,17621203,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Ruth E Johnson,2007,32 / 15,1578-85,No,17621203,"Ruth E Johnson; Gareth T Jones; Nicola J Wiles; Carol Chaddock; Richard G Potter; Chris Roberts; Deborah P M Symmons; Paul J Watson; David J Torgerson; Gary J Macfarlane; Active exercise, education, and cognitive behavioral therapy for persistent disabling low back pain: a randomized controlled trial, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , 2007-Jul-01; 32(15):1528-1159; 1578-85",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Active exercise, education and cognitive behavioral therapy vs. Usual care",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,5000,United Kingdom,2004,12556.92
4134,Is Burch colposuspension ever cost-effective compared with tension-free vaginal tape for stress incontinence?,"OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Burch colposuspension compared with tension-free vaginal tape. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov decision model was developed to compare costs (2005 US dollars) and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life years) of Burch and tension-free vaginal tape for stress urinary incontinence over 10 years from a health care system perspective. After surgery, outcomes included cure, persistent stress urinary incontinence followed by second surgery, and persistent stress urinary incontinence and mesh erosion after tension-free vaginal tape. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year was considered cost-effective. RESULTS: For the base-case, the Burch strategy cost more than tension-free vaginal tape ($9320 vs $8081), but was slightly more effective (7.260 vs 7.248 quality-adjusted life years). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $98,755 per quality-adjusted life year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year when the relative risk of cure after Burch to tension-free vaginal tape was greater than 1.09.

Around 14 million people in Spain, France, Italy, and Austria suffer from grass pollen induced allergic rhinitis. Standard care only provides symptoms relief, while allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT) treats the underlying cause of the disease. Grazax from ALK-Abelló is a new, tablet-based, effective route of SIT for home treatment. The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of Grazax in four Southern European countries. METHODS: A prospective pharmacoeconomic analyses was carried out alongside a multinational, clinical trial measuring the efficacy of Grazax. Pooled data on resource use and health outcomes were collected. A societal perspective was adopted, and the analysis had a nine-year time horizon. The primary outcome measure was quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Grazax was superior to standard care for all efficacy endpoints, including QALYs gained, and resulted in significantly less use of rescue medication and fewer hours missed from work. Grazax was cost-effective for all countries for an annual price in the range of 1500 euros - 1900 euros.

4138,Cost-effectiveness of GRAZAX for prevention of grass pollen induced rhinoconjunctivitis in Southern Europe,"BACKGROUND: Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is a global health problem. Around 14 million people in Spain, France, Italy, and Austria suffer from grass pollen induced allergic rhinitis. Standard care only provides symptoms relief, while allergen specific immunotherapy (SIT) treats the underlying cause of the disease. Grazax from ALK-Abelló is a new, tablet-based, effective route of SIT for home treatment. The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of Grazax in four Southern European countries. METHODS: A prospective pharmacoeconomic analyses was carried out alongside a multinational, clinical trial measuring the efficacy of Grazax. Pooled data on resource use and health outcomes were collected. A societal perspective was adopted, and the analysis had a nine-year time horizon. The primary outcome measure was quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Grazax was superior to standard care for all efficacy endpoints, including QALYs gained, and resulted in significantly less use of rescue medication and fewer hours missed from work. Grazax was cost-effective for all countries for an annual price in the range of 1500 euros - 1900 euros.

4139,Cost-effectiveness of the two-compound formulation calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate compared with commonly used topical treatments in the management of moderately severe plaque psoriasis in Scotland,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate (Dovobet) in the initial treatment of moderate severity plaque psoriasis vulgaris in Scotland. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An economic model was developed to simulate the costs and benefits of the most commonly used topicals in the management of plaque psoriasis. This was informed by an indirect unadjusted comparison of the effectiveness data to determine the relative efficacy of commonly used topicals. The model estimated their impact on costs and utility gain over a 1-year period. We accounted for direct medical costs from a health payer perspective. The cost-utility analysis included pharmacy costs and costs of failure of topicals in primary care in terms of secondary-care referrals for phototherapy. Extensive sensitivity analyses were undertaken to address areas of uncertainty in the parameters of the model. RESULTS: Patients treated with the two-compound formulation (TCF) of calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate (BDP) experienced better control of their psoriasis. In our model, this translated into reduced costs, as patients were less likely to be referred for phototherapy, and increased quality adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to other commonly used topicals. The TCF was estimated to generate annual savings ranging from 96 to 276 pounds per patient per year compared to the other commonly used alternative topicals. With reduced costs and superior outcomes, the TCF 'dominated' these other treatments since the latter were associated with higher cost and lower utility or QALY gain. The model findings were not influenced by changes to a range of model input parameters within plausible limits.

4143,An economic model of long-term use of celecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND: Previous evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of the cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor celecoxib (Celebrex, Pfizer Inc, USA) have produced conflicting results. The recent controversy over the cardiovascular (CV) risks of rofecoxib and other coxibs has renewed interest in the economic profile of celecoxib, the only coxib now available in the United States. The objective of our study was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of celecoxib compared with nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsNSAIDs) in a population of 60-year-old osteoarthritis (OA) patients with average risks of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) complications who require chronic daily NSAID therapy. METHODS: We used decision analysis based on data from the literature to evaluate cost-effectiveness from a modified societal perspective over patients' lifetimes, with outcomes expressed as incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity tests were performed to evaluate the impacts of advancing age, CV thromboembolic event risk, different analytic horizons and alternate treatment strategies after UGI adverse events. RESULTS: Our main findings were: 1) the base model incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for celecoxib versus nsNSAIDs was $31,097 per QALY; 2) the ICER per QALY was $19,309 for a model in which UGI ulcer and ulcer complication event risks increased with advancing age; 3) the ICER per QALY was $17,120 in sensitivity analyses combining serious CV thromboembolic event (myocardial infarction, stroke, CV death) risks with base model assumptions. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that chronic celecoxib is cost-effective versus nsNSAIDs in a population of 60-year-old OA patients with average risks of UGI events.",2007-01-03226,17610716,BMC Gastroenterol,Michael Loyd,2007,7 /,25,No,17610716,"Michael Loyd; Dale Rublee; Philip Jacobs; An economic model of long-term use of celecoxib in patients with osteoarthritis, BMC Gastroenterol, 2007; 7():1471-230X; 25",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Celecoxib vs. nsNSAIDs,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,31097,United States,2006,39921.85

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-utility of an IPT program for persons newly diagnosed with HIV. DESIGN: The cost-utility analysis of the IPT program was conducted using Markov cohort simulation methods. Newly diagnosed HIV-infected persons were evaluated using tuberculin skin test (TST); those with positive TST were offered IPT for 9 months (targeted testing strategy). An alternative strategy of offering IPT to all HIV-infected clients without TST screening was also evaluated (treat all strategy). The cost-utility of targeted testing was compared to the 'no program' and the 'treat all' strategies. RESULTS: The IPT program with the targeted testing strategy would produce 11 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per 100 HIV-infected clients compared to no program. Offering IPT using the treat all strategy gained an additional 30 QALYs per 100 clients compared to targeted testing. Compared to no program, the incremental cost-utility of the targeted testing program was US$102/QALY gained. The cost-utility of the IPT program under the treat all strategy was US$106/QALY gained compared to the targeted testing strategy.

4146,Cost-effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen therapy for the treatment of severe spasticity associated with cerebral palsy,"Spasticity is relatively common among children with cerebral palsy. This condition can be painful, can severely impair a child's ability to perform basic tasks, and can place an enormous emotional and financial burden on the family. Intrathecal baclofen delivered via an implantable pump is an effective treatment option for children unresponsive to oral medication and needing generalized motor control. However, the initial investment for the delivery device and its surgical placement can be a barrier to access. A cost-effectiveness analysis of intrathecal baclofen for adults in the British health care system concluded that intrathecal baclofen offered good value for the money. No similar analysis of intrathecal baclofen has been conducted in the context of the US health care system, and no study has specifically examined cost-effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen in a pediatric population. The aim of this article is to assess the cost-effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen among children with severe spasticity of cerebral origin who have not responded to less invasive treatments such as oral medications relative to alternative medical and surgical therapy. The authors used mathematical modeling and computer simulation to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year for identical cohorts of children treated with intrathecal baclofen or alternative therapy over a 5-year episode of treatment. Data on treatment costs representative of these children were derived from a health insurance claims database that included both commercial and Medicaid data. Utility values used to construct quality-adjusted life-years were obtained from a panel of expert clinicians who used the Health Utilities Index-2 to rate health states associated with the course of treatment. On average, intrathecal baclofen therapy increased the 5-year cost of treatment by $49 000 relative to alternative treatment. However, this was accompanied by an average gain of 1.2 quality-adjusted life-years. The net result was an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $42 000 per quality-adjusted life-year, a figure well within the $50 000 to $100 000 range that is widely accepted as offering good value for the money.",2007-01-03230,17608306,J Child Neurol,Gregory de Lissovoy,2007,22 / 1,49-59,No,17608306,"Gregory de Lissovoy; Louis S Matza; Hannah Green; Meghan Werner; Terence Edgar; Cost-effectiveness of intrathecal baclofen therapy for the treatment of severe spasticity associated with cerebral palsy, J Child Neurol, 2007-Jan; 22(1):0883-0738; 49-59",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with intrathecal baclofen (via implantable pump) vs. Conventional medical approach,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,42000,United States,2003,59076.42
4147,Cost effectiveness of mammography screening for Chinese women,"BACKGROUND: Although the cost effectiveness of screening mammography in most western developed populations has been accepted, it may not apply to Chinese women, who have a much lower breast cancer incidence. The authors estimated the cost effectiveness of biennial mammography in Hong Kong Chinese women to inform evidence-based screening policies. METHODS: For the current study, a state-transition Markov model was developed to simulate mammography screening, breast cancer diagnosis, and treatment in a hypothetical cohort of Chinese women. The benefit of mammography was modeled by assuming a stage shift, in which cancers in screened women were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier disease stage. The authors compared costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, and life years saved (LYS) for 5 screening strategies. RESULTS: Biennial screening resulted in a gain in life expectancy ranging from 4.3 days to 9.4 days compared with no screening at an incremental cost of from US $1,166 to US $2,425 per woman. The least costly, nondominated screening option was screening from ages 40 years to 69 years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US $61,600 per QALY saved or US $64,400 per LYS compared with no screening. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability of the ICER being below a threshold of US $50,000 per QALY (LYS) was 15.3% (14.6%).

METHODS: For the current study, a state-transition Markov model was developed to simulate mammography screening, breast cancer diagnosis, and treatment in a hypothetical cohort of Chinese women. The benefit of mammography was modeled by assuming a stage shift, in which cancers in screened women were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier disease stage. The authors compared costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, and life years saved (LYS) for 5 screening strategies. RESULTS: Biennial screening resulted in a gain in life expectancy ranging from 4.3 days to 9.4 days compared with no screening at an incremental cost of from US $1,166 to US $2,425 per woman. The least costly, nondominated screening option was screening from ages 40 years to 69 years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US $61,600 per QALY saved or US $64,400 per LYS compared with no screening. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the probability of the ICER being below a threshold of US $50,000 per QALY (LYS) was 15.3% (14.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that mammography for Hong Kong Chinese women currently may not be cost effective based on the arbitrary threshold of US $50,000 per QALY. However, clinicians must remain vigilant and periodically should revisit the question of population screening: Disease rates in China have been increasing because of westernization and socioeconomic development.",2007-01-03231,17607668,Cancer,Irene O L Wong,2007,110 / 4,885-95,No,17607668,"Irene O L Wong; Karen M Kuntz; Benjamin J Cowling; Cindy L K Lam; Gabriel M Leung; Cost effectiveness of mammography screening for Chinese women, Cancer, 2007-Aug-15; 110(4):0008-543X; 885-95",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Biennial mammography screening vs. No mammography screening,Not Stated,79 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,178800,United States,2005,236945.25
4151,Cost-utility analysis of genetic screening in families of patients with germline MUTYH mutations,"BACKGROUND: MUTYH associated polyposis (MAP) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder. Carriers of bi-allelic MUTYH germline mutations have a risk of approximately 60% to develop colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In the general population about 1.5% is a heterozygous MUTYH mutation carrier. Children of MAP patients have an increased risk of inheriting two MUTYH mutations compared to the general population, implicating an increased risk for developing CRC. METHODS: Using data from the literature and Dutch MAP patients (n = 40), we constructed a Markov model to perform a societal cost-utility analysis of genetic screening in MAP families. Genetic screening was done by testing the spouse first and, in case of a heterozygous spouse, also testing of the children. RESULTS: The cost of genetic screening of families of MAP patients, when compared to no genetic screening, was estimated at 25,000 euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The presence of Fecal Occult Blood testing (FOBT) population screening only slightly increased this cost-utility ratio to 25,500 euros per QALY. For a MUTYH heterozygote index-patient, the ratio was 51,500 euros per QALY. The results of our analysis were sensitive to several of the parameters in the model, including the cost assumed for molecular genetic testing. CONCLUSION: The costs per QALY of genetic screening in families of MAP patients are acceptable according to international standards.

4154,Cost-effectiveness of first- v. second-generation antipsychotic drugs: results from a randomised controlled trial in schizophrenia responding poorly to previous therapy,BACKGROUND: There are claims that the extra costs of atypical (second-generation) antipsychotic drugs over conventional (first-generation) drugs are offset by improved health-related quality of life. AIMS: To determine the relative costs and value of treatment with conventional or atypical antipsychotics in people with schizophrenia. METHOD: Cost-effectiveness acceptability analysis integrated clinical and economic randomised controlled trial data of conventional and atypical antipsychotics in routine practice. RESULTS: Conventional antipsychotics had lower costs and higher quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than atypical antipsychotics and were more than 50% likely to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The primary and sensitivity analyses indicated that conventional antipsychotics may be cost-saving and associated with a gain in QALYs compared with atypical antipsychotics.,2007-01-03237,17602120,Br J Psychiatry,L M Davies,2007,191 /,14-22,No,17602120,"L M Davies; S Lewis; P B Jones; T R E Barnes; F Gaughran; K Hayhurst; A Markwick; H Lloyd; Cost-effectiveness of first- v. second-generation antipsychotic drugs: results from a randomised controlled trial in schizophrenia responding poorly to previous therapy, Br J Psychiatry, 2007-Jul; 191():0007-1250; 14-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Second generation antipsychotics vs. First generation antipsychotics,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2900,United Kingdom,2003,-6667.9
4155,First- and second-trimester evaluation of risk for Down syndrome,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences in costs and outcomes of Down syndrome screening using data from the First and Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk (FASTER) Trial. METHODS: Seven possible screening options for Down syndrome were compared: 1) Triple Screen-maternal serum alpha fetoprotein, estriol, and hCG; 2) Quad-maternal serum alpha fetoprotein, estriol, hCG, and Inhibin A; 3) Combined First-nuchal translucency, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), free beta-hCG; 4) Integrated-nuchal translucency, PAPP-A, plus Quad; 5) Serum Integrated-PAPP-A, plus Quad; 6) Stepwise Sequential-Combined First plus Quad with results given after each test; and 7) Contingent Sequential-Combined First and only those with risk between 1:30 and 1:1,500 have Quad screen. The detection rates for each option were used given a 5% false-positive rate except for Contingent Sequential with a 4.3% false-positive rate. Outcomes included societal costs of each screening regimen (screening tests, amniocentesis, management of complications, and cost of care of Down syndrome live births), Down syndrome fetuses identified and born, the associated quality-adjusted life years, and the incremental cost-utility ratio. RESULTS: Based on the screening results derived from the 38,033 women evaluated in the FASTER trial, the Contingent Sequential screen dominated (lower costs with better outcomes) all other screens. For example, the Contingent Sequential cost 32.3 million dollars whereas the other screens ranged from 32.8 to 37.5 million dollars. The Sequential strategy led to the identification of the most Down syndrome fetuses of all of the screens, but at a higher cost per Down syndrome case diagnosed ($719,675 compared with $690,427) as compared with the Contingent Sequential. Because of the lower overall false-positive rate leading to fewer procedure-related miscarriages, the Contingent Sequential resulted in the highest quality-adjusted life years as well. The Contingent Sequential remained the most cost-effective option throughout sensitivity analysis of inputs, including amniocentesis rate after positive screen, rate of therapeutic abortion after Down syndrome diagnosis, and rate of procedure-related miscarriages. CONCLUSION: Analysis of this actual data from the FASTER Trial demonstrates that the Contingent Sequential test is the most cost-effective.

4161,Economic evaluation of sevelamer in patients with end-stage renal disease,"BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the most cost-effective way to treat hyperphosphataemia in patients with end-stage renal disease. Methods. We performed an economic analysis which compared the use of sevelamer with calcium carbonate in a simulated cohort of North American dialysis patients, using the perspective of the health care purchaser and a lifetime horizon. Outcomes considered were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and health care costs. To account for uncertainty, we considered four separate modelling strategies, obtaining data on the relative effectiveness of sevelamer from the recent Dialysis Clinical Outcomes Revisited study. RESULTS: In the base analysis, the use of sevelamer was associated with a cost per QALY gained of CAN$157,00, compared with calcium carbonate. Assuming no survival or hospitalization advantage for sevelamer, use of sevelamer resulted in an incremental cost of CAN$17,00 per patient. In alternate models which assumed sevelamer to be more effective than calcium-based phosphate binders, the use of sevelamer was associated with a cost per QALY gained ranging from CAN$127,00-$278,00. Assuming that sevelamer resulted in a differential reduction in mortality in patients > or = 65 years of age, use of sevelamer in this subgroup was associated with a cost per QALY of CAN$105,500. Results were similar in groups defined by age > or = 55 or by > or = 45 years. Since dialysis is expensive, interventions for dialysis patients that improve survival without reducing the need for dialysis will be associated with a cost-utility ratio at least as great as that of dialysis itself. As such, we repeated the primary analysis excluding the costs of dialysis and transplantation and found that the cost per QALY gained for sevelamer was $77,600. CONCLUSIONS: The cost per QALY gained for treating all dialysis patients with sevelamer exceeds what would usually be considered good value for the money. While the high cost per QALY was in part due to the inclusion of the costs of dialysis and transplant in the analysis, the cost per QALY gained remained relatively unattractive even when these costs were excluded. Although a lower cost per QALY gained is realized when only patients older than 65 years are treated, this strategy remains economically unattractive, particularly given the uncertainty of clinical benefit in this group.",2007-01-03241,17595182,Nephrol Dial Transplant,Braden Manns,2007,22 / 10,2867-78,No,17595182,"Braden Manns; Scott Klarenbach; Helen Lee; Bruce Culleton; Fiona Shrive; Marcello Tonelli; Economic evaluation of sevelamer in patients with end-stage renal disease, Nephrol Dial Transplant, 2007-Oct; 22(10):0931-0509; 2867-78",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with Sevelamer vs. Treatment with calcium-based phosphate binders,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,157500,Canada,2004,166078.82

METHODS: We conducted two analyses. A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) based on data from the PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events (PROactive) Study was performed to estimate the impact of additional pioglitazone treatment on life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) and macrovascular events. PROactive data was then used as a basis for a lifetime modelling analysis using a modified version of the validated CORE diabetes model that simulated the same outcomes over a 35-year time horizon. We accounted for direct medical costs from a health-care payer perspective and related these to the clinical outcomes from the study. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per annum and extensive sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty in input parameters. RESULTS: (i) Within-trial CEA: compared with placebo, pioglitazone was associated with improved life expectancy (undiscounted 0.0109 years), increased QALE [0.0190 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] and slightly higher costs ( pounds 102 per patient). After a mean treatment period of 3 years, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pioglitazone vs. placebo was pounds 5396 per QALY gained. The ICERs were relatively insensitive to cost and utility values and were most sensitive to event rates in the pioglitazone arm. (ii) Long-term CEA: pioglitazone was associated with improvements in clinical outcomes based on model projections beyond the PROactive Study. Patients treated with pioglitazone could expect improved life expectancy (undiscounted 0.406 years), increased QALE (0.152 QALYs) and higher costs of care ( pounds 619 per patient) compared with those on existing treatment alone. The base case analysis indicated that the ICER of pioglitazone vs. placebo was pounds 4060 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed there was an 84.3% likelihood that pioglitazone would be considered cost-effective in the UK using a willingness-to-pay threshold of pounds 30 000 per QALY gained. These long-term results were most sensitive to variation in the time horizon, the duration of cardiovascular benefit of pioglitazone, and changes in mortality rates.

4164,Cost-effectiveness analysis of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting for treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Adding trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy provides significant clinical benefit in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to assess clinical and economic implications of adding trastuzumab to adjuvant chemotherapy, based upon joint analysis of NSABP B-31 and NCCTG N9831 trials. METHODS: A Markov model with 4 health states was used to estimate the cost utility for a 50-year-old woman on the basis of trial results through 4 years and estimates of long-term recurrence and death based on a meta-analysis of trials. From 6 years onward, rates of recurrence and death were assumed to be the same in both trastuzumab and chemotherapy-only arms. Incremental costs were estimated for diagnostic and treatment-related costs. Analyses were from payer and societal perspectives, and these analyses were projected to lifetime and 20-year horizons. RESULTS: Over a lifetime, the projected cost of trastuzumab per quality-adjusted life year (QALY; discount rate 3%) gained was 26,417 dollars (range 9,104 dollars-69,340 dollars under multiway sensitivity analysis). Discounted incremental lifetime cost was 44,923 dollars, and projected life expectancy was 3 years longer for patients who received trastuzumab (19.4 years vs 16.4 years). During a 20-year horizon, the projected cost of adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy was 34,201 dollars per QALY gained. Key cost-effectiveness drivers were discount rate, trastuzumab price, and probability of metastasis. The cost-effectiveness result was robust to sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Trastuzumab for adjuvant treatment of early stage breast cancer was projected to be cost effective over a lifetime horizon, achieving a cost-effectiveness ratio below that of many widely accepted oncology treatments.",2007-01-03245,17592827,Cancer,Louis P Garrison,2007,110 / 3,489-98,No,17592827,"Louis P Garrison; Deborah Lubeck; Deepa Lalla; Virginia Paton; Amylou Dueck; Edith A Perez; Cost-effectiveness analysis of trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting for treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, Cancer, 2007-Aug-01; 110(3):0008-543X; 489-98",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy with adjuvant trastuzumab monotherapy vs. Doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy alone followed by paclitaxel,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,27637,United States,2005,36624.47
4165,Cost-effectiveness of switching to exemestane versus continued tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Sequential tamoxifen/exemestane therapy reportedly improves disease-free survival in women with primary breast cancer compared with continued tamoxifen therapy. The objective of the current study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of switching to exemestane after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen versus continued tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with primary breast cancer for a total of 5 years of adjuvant therapy. METHODS: A Markov model based on the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) population compared switching to exemestane versus continued tamoxifen for 2.5 years of therapy and 5 years of postadjuvant therapy follow-up. Disease progression and hazards ratios (HR) for recurrence and survival were determined from datasets (IES and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program of the National Cancer Institute) and from the published literature. An expert panel validated treatment patterns, outcomes, and resource utilization. Direct medical costs were included based on published sources. Cost-effectiveness ratios were determined, and extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Exemestane was found to be more effective than tamoxifen alone with regard to disease-free survival (2.6% absolute improvement), life-years gained (0.1028 LY), and quality-adjusted life-years gained (0.1195 QALY), at an additional cost of 2,889 Can dollars per person over 7.5 years. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were 28,119 Can dollars/LY gained and 24,185 Can dollars/QALY gained. The model was most sensitive to distant recurrence HR but was robust to variations in clinical, cost, and utility parameters.

4166,Cost-effectiveness of letrozole versus tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy in hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: In Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98, a randomized, double-blind trial comparing 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with letrozole versus tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, letrozole significantly improved disease-free survival by 19% and reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence by 28% and distant recurrence by 27%. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with letrozole versus tamoxifen from a US health care system perspective. Probabilities and costs of breast cancer recurrence and treatment-related adverse events and health-state utilities were based on published results of BIG 1-98 and other published studies. Costs and QALYs were estimated over the lifetime of a cohort of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, aged 60 years at initiation of therapy. In our base case, we assumed that benefits of letrozole on risk of breast cancer recurrence are maintained for 5 years after therapy discontinuation (""carry-over effect"") and examined the effects of this assumption on results in sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions, letrozole yields an additional 0.409 QALYs versus tamoxifen at an additional cost of $9705, yielding a cost per QALY gained for letrozole versus tamoxifen of $23,743 (95% confidence interval, $14,087-$51,129). Assuming no carry-over effects, letrozole yields 0.264 QALYs at a cost of $10,341, for a cost per QALY gained of $39,098 (95% confidence interval, $23,968- $83,501).

4167,Cost effectiveness of laparoscopic versus mini-incision open donor nephrectomy: a randomized study,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness remains an issue surrounding the introduction of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy (LDN). METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial the cost-effectiveness of LDN versus mini-incision open donor nephrectomy (ODN) was determined. Fifty donors were included in each group. All in-hospital costs were documented. Postoperatively, case record forms were sent to the donors during 1-year follow-up to record return-to-work and societal costs. To offset costs against quality of life, the Euroqol-5D questionnaire was administered preoperatively and 3, 7, 14, 28, 90, 180, and 365 days postoperatively. RESULTS: Mean total costs were euro6,090 (US$7,308) after LDN and euro4,818 ($5,782) after ODN (P<0.001). Disposables influenced the cost difference most. Mean productivity loss was 68 and 75 days after LDN and ODN respectively, corresponding to euro783 ($940) gained per donor after LDN. The main gain in quality of life in the LDN group was realized within 4 weeks postoperatively. LDN resulted in a mean gain of 0.03 quality-adjusted life years at mean costs of euro1,271 ($1,525) and euro488 ($586) from a healthcare perspective and a societal perspective, respectively. This implies that one additional Quality-Adjusted Life Year after LDN costs about euro16,000 ($19,200) from a societal point of view and about euro41,000 ($49,200) from a health-care perspective. Activities other than work were resumed significantly earlier after LDN (66 vs. 91 days, P=0.01).

METHODS: An economic evaluation undertaken alongside a randomised controlled trial of first eye cataract surgery in secondary care ophthalmology clinics. A sample of 306 women over 70 years old with bilateral cataracts was randomised to cataract surgery (expedited, approximately four weeks) or control (routine, 12 months wait); 75% of participants had baseline acuity of 6/12 or better. Outcomes included falls and the EuroQol EQ-5D. RESULTS: The operated group cost a mean pounds sterling 2004 (bootstrapped) more than the control group over one year (95% confidence interval (CI), pounds sterling 1363 to pounds sterling 2833) (p<0.001), but experienced on average 0.456 fewer falls, an incremental cost per fall prevented of pounds sterling 4390. The bootstrapped mean gain in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient was 0.056 (95% CI, 0.006 to 0.108) (p<0.001).

4170,Renal artery stenosis: cost-effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment,"PURPOSE: To use a decision analytic model to determine the cost-effectiveness of performing diagnostic digital subtraction angiography (DSA), computed tomographic (CT) angiography, or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography or proceeding immediately to tentative percutaneous revascularization in patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With use of a Markov-Monte Carlo decision model, cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from a societal perspective. Data were derived from the Renal Artery Diagnostic Imaging Study in Hypertension and from published literature. The base-case analyses were used to evaluate a 50-year-old patient with a diastolic blood pressure higher than 95 mm Hg and one or more clinical clues suggestive of renovascular hypertension. Outcome measures were quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: For a 50-year-old male patient, immediate tentative revascularization was the least costly (euro54 415) and most effective (12.265 QALYs) strategy. For the other strategies, costs and QALYs, respectively, were euro55 570 and 12.195 for DSA, euro55 191 and 12.163 for CT angiography, and euro56 890 and 12.088 for MR angiography. For a 50-year-old female patient, costs and QALYs, respectively, were euro66 731 and 13.731 for MR angiography, euro63 970 and 13.749 for CT angiography, and euro63 079 and 13.902 for DSA. Immediate tentative revascularization yielded more QALYs (13.937) and was more costly (euro63 329) than DSA. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro7143 per QALY. As the prior probability increased, use of a more invasive diagnostic imaging strategy became justified. Also, the sensitivities of CT angiography and MR angiography and the costs of DSA influenced the results. CONCLUSION: Given currently accepted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, immediate tentative percutaneous revascularization is a cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.

4178,An economic evaluation of prolonged mechanical ventilation,"OBJECTIVE: Patients who receive prolonged mechanical ventilation have high resource utilization and relatively poor outcomes, especially the elderly, and are increasing in number. The economic implications of prolonged mechanical ventilation provision, however, are uncertain and would be helpful to providers and policymakers. Therefore, we aimed to determine the lifetime societal value of prolonged mechanical ventilation. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Adopting the perspective of a healthcare payor, we developed a Markov model to determine the cost effectiveness of providing mechanical ventilation for at least 21 days to a 65-yr-old critically ill base-case patient compared with the provision of comfort care resulting in withdrawal of ventilation. Input data were derived from the medical literature, Medicare, and a recent large cohort study of ventilated patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We determined lifetime costs and survival, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and cost effectiveness as reflected by costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Providing prolonged mechanical ventilation to the base-case patient cost ""dollars""55,460 per life-year gained and ""dollars""82,411 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with withdrawal of ventilation. Cost-effectiveness ratios were most sensitive to variation in age, hospital costs, and probability of readmission, although less sensitive to postacute care-facility costs. Specifically, incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained by prolonged mechanical ventilation provision exceeded ""dollars""100,000 with age >or=68 and when predicted 1-yr mortality was >50%. CONCLUSIONS: The cost effectiveness of prolonged mechanical ventilation provision varies dramatically based on age and likelihood of poor short- and long-term outcomes. Identifying patients likely to have unfavorable outcomes, lowering intensity of care for appropriate patients, and reducing costly readmissions should be future priorities in improving the value of prolonged mechanical ventilation.",2007-01-03256,17581479,Crit Care Med,Christopher E Cox,2007,35 / 8,1918-27,No,17581479,"Christopher E Cox; Shannon S Carson; Joseph A Govert; Lakshmipathi Chelluri; Gillian D Sanders; An economic evaluation of prolonged mechanical ventilation, Crit Care Med, 2007-Aug; 35(8):0090-3493; 1918-27",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prolonged mechanical ventilator for at least 21 days with placement of tracheostomy vs. Mechanical ventilator discontinued between days 7 and 21 after initiation,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,82411,United States,2005,109210.82

METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed to incorporate clinical, epidemiological, and economic data and allow extrapolation of trial results and incorporation of long-term treatment. Assumptions regarding treatment beyond the trials were based on open extensions from the trials and treatment guidelines by the British Society for Rheumatology. Results are presented for both the societal perspective and the perspective of the National Health Service (UK pound, discounted 3.5 percent). RESULTS: Under the assumption that disease activity would be controlled and functional capacity would remain stable while on drug, treatment with infliximab (5 mg/kg every 6 weeks) dominates standard treatment in the societal perspective. In the National Health Service perspective, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained over lifetime was pound28,300 and pound26,800 for the two trials. If functional capacity were to deteriorate at half the rate of untreated patients, the cost per QALY gained would be pound35,300 and pound34,100, respectively.

METHODS: This was a cost-effectiveness analysis based on published literature and data from the Canadian Institute of Health Information. The participants were fictitious male and female cardiac arrest patients who were initially managed with on-site AEDs, compared with similar patients managed without on-site AEDs. This group included a subgroup of high-risk patients (i.e., heart failure and left ventricular ejection fraction<35 percent). The analysis was conducted in a variety of settings including hospitals and homes in Ontario, Canada. The main outcome evaluated was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from a payer's perspective. RESULTS: Cost per QALY (all costs reported in Canadian dollars) was $12,768 when AEDs were deployed in hospitals, $511,766 when deployed in office buildings, $2,360,023 when deployed in apartment buildings, $87,569 when deployed in homes of high-risk patients, and $1,529,371 when deployed in homes of people older than 55 years of age.

4186,The cost-effectiveness of sibutramine in non-diabetic obese patients: evidence from four Western countries,"This paper aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of sibutramine in treating obese patients in the Western countries. The model estimates the costs and quality of life benefits directly associated with weight losses combined with the costs and benefits associated with the reduced incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes. The pivotal effectiveness evidence is derived from a German multicentre, double-blind, randomized clinical trial on obese (body mass index >/= 30 Euro kg m(-2)) patients. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year ranges from 10,734 Euro in Switzerland to 13,707 Euro in Germany. The total number of CHD events avoided ranges from 1.96 for the UK to 4.49 for Switzerland. The number of diabetes cases avoided is in the region of 3.0 (ranges from 2.58 for Germany to 3.28 for Switzerland). The majority of costs and benefits are accrued through sibutramine treatment and monitoring. Univariate sensitivity analyses show that results are sensitive to changes in the utility directly attributable to weight losses.

4191,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three types of physiotherapy used to reduce chronic low back pain disability: a pragmatic randomized trial with economic evaluation,"STUDY DESIGN: Pragmatic, randomized, assessor blinded, clinical trial with economic analysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three kinds of physiotherapy commonly used to reduce disability in chronic low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Physiotherapy reduces disability in chronic back pain, but there are several forms of physiotherapy and it is unclear which is most effective or cost effective. METHODS: A total of 212 patients referred to physiotherapy with chronic low back pain were randomized to receive usual outpatient physiotherapy, spinal stabilization classes, or physiotherapist-led pain management classes. Primary outcome was Roland Disability Questionnaire score 18 months from baseline; secondary measures were pain, health-related quality of life, and time off work. Healthcare costs associated with low back pain and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were also measured. RESULTS.: A total of 71 participants were assigned to usual outpatient physiotherapy, 72 to spinal stabilization, and 69 to physiotherapist-led pain management. A total of 160 (75%) provided follow-up data at 18 months, showing similar improvements with all interventions: mean (95% confidence intervals) Roland Disability Questionnaire score improved from 11.1 (9.6-12.6) to 6.9 (5.3-8.4) with usual outpatient physiotherapy, 12.8 (11.4-14.2) to 6.8 (4.9-8.6) with spinal stabilization, and 11.5 (9.8-13.1) to 6.5 (4.5-8.6) following pain management classes. Pain, quality of life, and time off work also improved within all groups with no between-group differences. Mean (SD) healthcare costs and QALY gain were pound474 (840) and 0.99 (0.27) for individual physiotherapy, pound379 (1040) and 0.90 (0.37) for spinal stabilization, and pound165 (202) and 1.00 (0.28) for pain management. CONCLUSIONS: For chronic low back pain, all three physiotherapy regimens improved disability and other relevant health outcomes, regardless of their content.
