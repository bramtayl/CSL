27201,Cost effectiveness of Supplementary Immunization for Measles in India,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of a supplementary immunization activity (SIA) for measles in a district of India with measles vaccine coverage equivalent to the National average. DESIGN: A state transition model is used to estimate the effect of routine vaccination with measles vaccine as well as with measles vaccine during the SIA. The model follows each sub-cohort in the target population at respective age (1-5 years) to five years of age, using age specific incidence rate and vaccination rate to determine the number of cases of measles. Using age specific incidence rates and complication rates for measles; deaths and disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted is estimated. RESULTS: Using base-case assumptions, an estimated 65479 cases of measles and 1637 deaths due to measles will be prevented in a span of four years from a single supplementary immunization activity in a pediatric population (1-5 years of age) of size 839,473. The cost per measles vaccine dose delivered is INR 30. Using base case analysis the cost to avert a death is INR 15381 and the cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted is INR 430. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementary immunization activity for measles is cost-effective. However, this cannot be considered superior to a second dose of measles in routine immunization.",2009-99-04777,19578225,Indian Pediatr,Mayank Dabral,2009,/,,No,19578225,"Mayank Dabral; Cost effectiveness of Supplementary Immunization for Measles in India, Indian Pediatr, 2009-May-20; ():0019-6061",DALY,India,Not Stated,Immunization,Supplementary immunization activity (SIA) for measles vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,430,India,2007,13.06
27202,Comparative impact assessment of child pneumonia interventions,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce pneumonia mortality through risk reduction, immunization and case management. METHODS: Country-specific pneumonia burden estimates and intervention costs from WHO were used to review estimates of pneumonia risk in children under 5 years of age and the efficacy of interventions (case management, pneumonia-related vaccines, improved nutrition and reduced indoor air pollution from household solid fuels). We calculated health benefits (disability-adjusted life years, DALYs, averted) and intervention costs over a period of 10 years for 40 countries, accounting for 90% of pneumonia child deaths. FINDINGS: Solid fuel use contributes 30% (90% confidence interval: 18-44) to the burden of childhood pneumonia. Efficacious community-based treatment, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, zinc supplementation and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae immunization through existing programmes showed cost-effectiveness ratios of 10-60 International dollars (I$) per DALY in low-income countries and less than I$ 120 per DALY in middle-income countries. Low-emission biomass stoves and cleaner fuels may be cost-effective in low-income regions. Facility-based treatment is potentially cost-effective, with ratios of I$ 60-120 per DALY. The cost-effectiveness of community case management depends on home visit cost. CONCLUSION: Vaccines against Hib and S. pneumoniae, efficacious case management, breastfeeding promotion and zinc supplementation are cost-effective in reducing pneumonia mortality. Environmental and nutritional interventions reduce pneumonia and provide other benefits.

27215,Comparative impact assessment of child pneumonia interventions,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce pneumonia mortality through risk reduction, immunization and case management. METHODS: Country-specific pneumonia burden estimates and intervention costs from WHO were used to review estimates of pneumonia risk in children under 5 years of age and the efficacy of interventions (case management, pneumonia-related vaccines, improved nutrition and reduced indoor air pollution from household solid fuels). We calculated health benefits (disability-adjusted life years, DALYs, averted) and intervention costs over a period of 10 years for 40 countries, accounting for 90% of pneumonia child deaths. FINDINGS: Solid fuel use contributes 30% (90% confidence interval: 18-44) to the burden of childhood pneumonia. Efficacious community-based treatment, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding, zinc supplementation and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae immunization through existing programmes showed cost-effectiveness ratios of 10-60 International dollars (I$) per DALY in low-income countries and less than I$ 120 per DALY in middle-income countries.

This study aims to evaluate the population-level costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of alternative delivering hearing aids models in Tamil Nadu, India METHODS: In an observational study design, we estimated total costs and effects of two active screening programs in the community in combination with the provision of hearing aids at secondary care level, and the costs and effects of the provision of hearing aids at tertiary care level. Screening and hearing aid delivery costs were estimated on the basis of program records and an empirical assessment of health personnel time input. Household costs for seeking and undergoing hearing health care were collected with a questionnaire (see Additional file 2). Health effects were estimated on the basis of compliance with the hearing aid, and associated changes in disability, and were expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. RESULTS: Active screening and provision of hearing aids at the secondary care level costs around Rs.7,000 (US$152) per patient, whereas provision of hearing aids at the tertiary care level costs Rs 5,693 (US$122) per patient. The cost per DALY averted was around RS 42,200 (US$900) at secondary care level and Rs 33,900 (US$720) at tertiary care level. The majority of people did consult other providers before being screened in the community. Costs of food and transport ranged between Rs. 2 (US$0,04) and Rs. 39 (US$0,83). CONCLUSION: Active screening and provision of hearing aids at the secondary care level is slightly more costly than passive screening and fitting of hearing aids at the tertiary care level, but seems also able to reach a higher coverage of hearing aids services. Although crude estimates indicate that both passive and active screening programs can be cautiously considered as cost-effective according to international thresholds, important questions remain regarding the implementation of the latter.",2009-99-04933,19435490,BMC Public Health,Baltussen Rob,2009,9 /,135,No,19435490,"Baltussen Rob; Abraham Vinod J; Priya Monica; Achamma Balraj; Anand Job; Gift Norman; Abraham Joseph; Costs and health effects of screening and delivery of hearing aids in Tamil Nadu, India: an observational study, BMC Public Health, 2009; 9():1471-2458; 135",DALY,India,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Screening",Active screening and provision of hearing aids at the secondary care level vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,903,United States,2007,1127.15

27244,"Generalized cost-effectiveness analysis of a package of interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease in Buenos Aires, Argentina","ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Chronic diseases, represented mainly by cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, are increasing in developing countries and account for 53% of chronic diseases in Argentina. There is strong evidence that a reduction of 50% of the deaths due to CVD can be attributed to a reduction in smoking, hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Generalized cost-effectiveness analysis (GCE) is a methodology designed by WHO to inform decision makers about the extent to which current or new interventions represent an efficient use of resources. We aimed to use GCE analysis to identify the most efficient interventions to decrease CVD. METHODS: Six individual interventions (treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking cessation and combined clinical strategies to reduce the 10 year CVD Risk) and two population-based interventions (cooperation between government, consumer associations and bakery chambers to reduce salt in bread, and mass education strategies to reduce hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and obesity) were selected for analysis. Estimates of effectiveness were entered into age and sex specific models to predict their impact in terms of age-weighted and discounted DALYs saved (disability-adjusted life years). To translate the age- and sex-adjusted incidence of CVD events into health changes, we used risk model software developed by WHO (PopMod). Costs of services were measured in Argentine pesos, and discounted at an annual rate of 3%. Different budgetary impact scenarios were explored. RESULTS: The average cost-effectiveness ratio in argentine pesos (ARS$) per DALY for the different interventions were: (i) less salt in bread $151; (ii) mass media campaign $547; (iii) combination drug therapy provided to subjects with a 20%, 10% and 5% global CVD risk, $3,599, $4,113 and $4,533, respectively; (iv) high blood pressure (HBP) lowering therapy $7,716; (v) tobacco cessation with bupropion $ 33,563; and (iv) high-cholesterol lowering therapy with statins $ 70,994.

27250,Costs and cost-effectiveness of vector control in Eritrea using insecticide-treated bed nets,"While insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are a recognized effective method for preventing malaria, there has been an extensive debate in recent years about the best large-scale implementation strategy. Implementation costs and cost-effectiveness are important elements to consider when planning ITN programmes, but so far little information on these aspects is available from national programmes.This study uses a standardized methodology, as part of a larger comparative study, to collect cost data and cost-effectiveness estimates from a large programme providing ITNs at the community level and ante-natal care facilities in Eritrea. This is a unique model of ITN implementation fully integrated into the public health system.Base case analysis results indicated that the average annual cost of ITN delivery (2005 USD 3.98) was very attractive when compared with past ITN delivery studies at different scales. Financing was largely from donor sources though the Eritrean government and net users also contributed funding. The intervention's cost-effectiveness was in a highly attractive range for sub-Saharan Africa. The cost per DALY averted was USD 13 - 44. The cost per death averted was USD 438-1449. Distribution of nets coincided with significant increases in coverage and usage of nets nationwide, approaching or exceeding international targets in some areas.ITNs can be cost-effectively delivered at a large scale in sub-Saharan Africa through a distribution system that is highly integrated into the health system. Operating and sustaining such a system still requires strong donor funding and support as well as a functional and extensive system of health facilities and community health workers already in place.",2009-01-01679,19331664,Malar J,Joshua O Yukich,2009,8 /,51,No,19331664,"Joshua O Yukich; Mehari Zerom; Tewolde Ghebremeskel; Fabrizio Tediosi; Christian Lengeler; Joshua O.

27251,Targeted BCG vaccination against severe tuberculosis in low-prevalence settings: epidemiologic and economic assessment,"BACKGROUND: BCG vaccine protects against the severe forms of tuberculosis (TB) in children. Several low-prevalence countries are reviewing their policy, usually shifting from universal vaccination to vaccination of infants in high-risk groups only. We combined an epidemiologic analysis with a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of targeted strategies. METHODS: We fitted a static model to the data to estimate vaccine efficacy and risk of disease. We applied our method to the Dutch situation, analyzing severe TB cases in high-risk group children age 0-5, between 1996 and 2003. We considered the current strategy targeting immigrant children from high-incidence countries, and a proposed strategy additionally targeting children from 3 lower-incidence, but higher-immigration, countries. RESULTS: In the absence of vaccination, the annual risk of developing severe TB for a child in the current target group is 3/100,000, while BCG vaccination reduces this risk by 73%. Therefore about 9000 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 case. Vaccinating children from high-incidence countries would then cost about Euro 4,500 per discounted disability-adjusted life year averted. In the extended target group, the risk of disease is somewhat lower with a similar vaccine effectiveness, so costs are raised. CONCLUSIONS: The current Dutch BCG strategy, as well as the proposed inclusion of immigrant children from Turkey, Surinam and former Yugoslavia, is on average cost-effective.

27253,Cost-effectiveness of selected interventions for hearing impairment in Africa and Asia: a mathematical modelling approach,"The purpose of this paper was to present estimates of costs and effects of selected interventions for hearing impairment in Africa and Asia. The method used mathematical simulation models on the basis of WHO burden of disease information, and WHO-CHOICE costing databases.

27271,Cost-effectiveness of malaria intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) in Mozambique and the United Republic of Tanzania,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of malaria intermittent preventive treatment in infants (IPTi) using sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). METHODS: In two previous IPTi trials in Ifakara (United Republic of Tanzania) and Manhiça (Mozambique), SP was administered three times to infants before 9 months of age through the Expanded Programme on Immunization. Based on the efficacy results of the intervention and on malaria incidence in the target population, an estimate was made of the number of clinical malaria episodes prevented. This number and an assumed case-fatality rate of 1.57% were used, in turn, to estimate the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) averted and the number of deaths averted. The cost of the intervention, including start-up and recurrent costs, was then assessed on the basis of these figures. FINDINGS: The cost per clinical episode of malaria averted was US$ 1.57 (range: US$ 0.8-4.0) in Ifakara and US$ 4.73 (range: US$ 1.7-30.3) in Manhiça; the cost per DALY averted was US$ 3.7 (range: US$ 1.6-12.2) in Ifakara and US$ 11.2 (range: US$ 3.6-92.0) in Manhiça; and the cost per death averted was US$ 100.2 (range: US$ 43.0-330.9) in Ifakara and US$ 301.1 (range: US$ 95.6-2498.4) in Manhiça.

27273,Cost-effectiveness of Rotavirus vaccination in Vietnam,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhea leading to hospitalization or disease-specific death among young children. New rotavirus vaccines have recently been approved. Some previous studies have provided broad qualitative insights into the health and economic consequences of introducing the vaccines into low-income countries, representing several features of rotavirus infection, such as varying degrees of severity and age-dependency of clinical manifestation, in their model-based analyses. We extend this work to reflect additional features of rotavirus (e.g., the possibility of reinfection and varying degrees of partial immunity conferred by natural infection), and assess the influence of the features on the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination. METHODS: We developed a Markov model that reflects key features of rotavirus infection, using the most recent data available. We applied the model to the 2004 Vietnamese birth cohort and re-evaluated the cost-effectiveness (2004 US dollars per disability-adjusted life year [DALY]) of rotavirus vaccination (Rotarix) compared to no vaccination, from both societal and health care system perspectives. We conducted univariate sensitivity analyses and also performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, based on Monte Carlo simulations drawing parameter values from the distributions assigned to key uncertain parameters. RESULTS: Rotavirus vaccination would not completely protect young children against rotavirus infection due to the partial nature of vaccine immunity, but would effectively reduce severe cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis (outpatient visits, hospitalizations, or deaths) by about 67% over the first 5 years of life. Under base-case assumptions (94% coverage and $5 per dose), the incremental cost per DALY averted from vaccination compared to no vaccination would be $540 from the societal perspective and $550 from the health care system perspective. CONCLUSION: Introducing rotavirus vaccines would be a cost-effective public health intervention in Vietnam. However, given the uncertainty about vaccine efficacy and potential changes in rotavirus epidemiology in local settings, further clinical research and re-evaluation of rotavirus vaccination programs may be necessary as new information emerges.",2009-99-05288,19159483,BMC Public Health,Sun-Young Kim,2009,9 /,29,No,19159483,"Sun-Young Kim; Sue J Goldie; Joshua A Salomon; Cost-effectiveness of Rotavirus vaccination in Vietnam, BMC Public Health, 2009; 9():1471-2458; 29",DALY,Viet Nam,Not Stated,Immunization,Rotavirus vaccination targeting the highly prevalent G1P[8] genotype vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,540,United States,2004,739.85
27274,Cost effectiveness of community-based therapeutic care for children with severe acute malnutrition in Zambia: decision tree model,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Children aged under five years with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Africa and Asia have high mortality rates without effective treatment. Primary care-based treatment of SAM can have good outcomes but its cost effectiveness is largely unknown. METHOD: This study estimated the cost effectiveness of community-based therapeutic care (CTC) for children with severe acute malnutrition in government primary health care centres in Lusaka, Zambia, compared to no care. A decision tree model compared the costs (in year 2008 international dollars) and outcomes of CTC to a hypothetical 'do-nothing' alternative. The primary outcomes were mortality within one year, and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) after surviving one year. Outcomes and health service costs of CTC were obtained from the CTC programme, local health services and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of unit costs. Outcomes of doing nothing were estimated from published African cohort studies. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were done. RESULTS: The mean cost of CTC per child was $203 (95% confidence interval (CI) $139-$274), of which ready to use therapeutic food (RUTF) cost 36%, health centre visits cost 13%, hospital admissions cost 17% and technical support while establishing the programme cost 34%. Expected death rates within one year of presentation were 9.2% with CTC and 20.8% with no treatment (risk difference 11.5% (95% CI 0.4-23.0%). CTC cost $1760 (95% CI $592-$10142) per life saved and $ 53 (95% CI $18-$306) per DALY gained. CTC was at least 80% likely to be cost effective if society was willing to pay at least $88 per DALY gained. Analyses were most sensitive to assumptions about mortality rates with no treatment, weeks of CTC per child and costs of purchasing RUTF. CONCLUSION: CTC is relatively cost effective compared to other priority health care interventions in developing countries, for a wide range of assumptions.",2009-99-05303,19146668,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Max O Bachmann,2009,7 /,2,Yes,19146668,"Max O Bachmann; Cost effectiveness of community-based therapeutic care for children with severe acute malnutrition in Zambia: decision tree model, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2009; 7():1478-7547; 2",DALY,Zambia,Not Stated,Other,"Community-based therapeutic care, ready to use therapeutic food, a nutrient-dense food with a nutrient content/100 kcal that is similar to F100 milk vs. None",Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,53,United States,2008,63.71
27275,"Cost-effectiveness of introducing the conjugated pneumococcal vaccine to routine free immunizations for infants in Lazio, Italy","OBJECTIVE: To examine the health outcomes and costs of a hypothetical pneumococcal vaccination campaign among the general infant population in the Lazio region (Italy). METHODS: We developed a model simulating direct medical costs and health outcomes of vaccinating infants with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (PCV-7) compared to the costs (in and outpatient) of treating the disease, from a public health service perspective. According to vaccine trials' outcomes, we considered vaccine effectiveness in preventing part of the invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), pneumonia of any aetiology, and acute otitis moedia. Age-specific incidence, mortality and health care costs came from local surveillance and surveys; the vaccine costs euro40/dose. Annual budgetary impact and macro-health benefits were predicted for 2005-2014. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as net healthcare costs per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) gained. RESULTS: After 10 years, five cases of meningitis, 20 IPD, 933 pneumonia, 406 pneumonia-related hospitalisations, and 3160 otitis cases would be averted annually by vaccinating. The annual cost of vaccination would be euro4.9m, and annual costs averted would be euro1.4m. Additional healthcare costs of a mass vaccination would decrease over time from euro5.1m to euro3.5m per year. At baseline, net cost per averted DALY was euro18.0k, if health benefits are not discounted, and euro51.7k adopting a 3.5% discount rate; it was 12% lower with a hypothesis of high IPD incidence and 68% lower if the vaccine cost 50% less. CONCLUSIONS: The cost of the vaccine makes the campaign more expensive than today's recommended infant vaccinations.

METHODS: We developed a mathematical simulation model for uncorrected refractive error, using prevailing prevalence and incidence rates. Remission rates reflected the absence or presence of screening strategies for school children. All screening strategies were implemented for a period of 10 years and were compared to a situation were no screening was implemented. Outcome measures were life years adjusted for disability (DALYs), costs of screening and provision of spectacles and follow-up for six different screening strategies, and cost-effectiveness in international dollars per DALY averted. Epidemiological information was derived from the burden of disease study from the World Health Organization (WHO). Cost data were derived from large databases from the WHO. Both univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed on key parameters to determine the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: In all regions, screening of 5-15 years old children yields most health effects, followed by screening of 11-15 years old, 5-10 years old, and screening of 8 and 13 years old. Screening of broad-age intervals is always more costly than screening of single-age intervals, and there are important economies of scale for simultaneous screening of both 5-10 and 11-15-year-old children. In all regions, screening of 11-15 years old is the most cost-effective intervention, with the cost per DALY averted ranging from I$67 per DALY averted in the Asian sub-region to I$458 per DALY averted in the European sub-region.

All screening strategies were implemented for a period of 10 years and were compared to a situation were no screening was implemented. Outcome measures were life years adjusted for disability (DALYs), costs of screening and provision of spectacles and follow-up for six different screening strategies, and cost-effectiveness in international dollars per DALY averted. Epidemiological information was derived from the burden of disease study from the World Health Organization (WHO). Cost data were derived from large databases from the WHO. Both univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed on key parameters to determine the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: In all regions, screening of 5-15 years old children yields most health effects, followed by screening of 11-15 years old, 5-10 years old, and screening of 8 and 13 years old. Screening of broad-age intervals is always more costly than screening of single-age intervals, and there are important economies of scale for simultaneous screening of both 5-10 and 11-15-year-old children. In all regions, screening of 11-15 years old is the most cost-effective intervention, with the cost per DALY averted ranging from I$67 per DALY averted in the Asian sub-region to I$458 per DALY averted in the European sub-region. The incremental cost per DALY averted of screening 5-15 years old ranges between I$111 in the Asian sub-region to I$672 in the European sub-region.
