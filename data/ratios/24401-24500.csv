24401,Cost-utility of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir versus other direct-acting antivirals for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b infection in China,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (SOF/VEL) compared with other direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) in Chinese patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV). DESIGN: A Markov model was developed to estimate the disease progression of patients with HCV over a lifetime horizon from the healthcare system perspective. Efficacy, clinical inputs and utilities were derived from the published literature. Drug costs were from the market price survey, and health costs for Markov health states were sourced from a Chinese study. Costs and utilities were discounted at an annual rate of 5%. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the impact of input parameters on the results. INTERVENTIONS: SOF/VEL was compared with sofosbuvir+ribavirin (SR), sofosbuvir+dasabuvir (SD), daclatasvir+asunaprevir (DCV/ASV), ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir+dasabuvir (3D) and elbasvir/grazoprevir (EBR/GZR). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs). RESULTS: SOF/VEL was economically dominant over SR and SD. However, 3D was economically dominant compared with SOF/VEL. Compared with DCV/ASV, SOF/VEL was cost-effective with the ICUR of US$1522 per QALY. Compared with EBR/GZR, it was not cost-effective with the ICUR of US$369 627 per QALY. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that reducing the cost of SOF/VEL to the lower value of CI resulted in dominance over EBR/GZR and 3D. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that 3D was cost-effective in 100% of iterations in patients with genotype (GT) 1b and SOF/VEL was not cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other oral DAA agents, SOF/VEL treatment was not the most cost-effectiveness option for patients with chronic HCV GT1b in China. Lower the price of SOF/VEL will make it cost-effective while simplifying treatment and achieving the goal of HCV elimination.",2020-01-34166,32819983,BMJ Open,Haoya Yun,2020,10 / 8,e035224,No,32819983,"Haoya Yun; Guoqiang Zhao; Xiaojie Sun; Lizheng Shi; Johanna Vásquez; Sergio Botero; Cost-utility of sofosbuvir/velpatasvir versus other direct-acting antivirals for chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b infection in China, BMJ Open , 2020 Aug 30; 10(8):2044-6055; e035224",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,sofosbuvir/velpatasvir vs. sofosbuvir + ribavirin,"genotype 1b, treatment naive",45 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-83778.5,United States,2019,-84812.06

24406,Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness of individual placement support and cognitive remediation in people with severe mental illness: Results from a randomized clinical trial,"BACKGROUND: Administrators and policymakers are increasingly interested in individual placement and support (IPS) as a way of helping people with severe mental illness (SMI) obtain employment or education. It is thus important to investigate the cost-effectiveness to secure that resources are being used properly. METHODS: In a randomized clinical trial, 720 people diagnosed with SMI were allocated into three groups; (a) IPS, (b) IPS supplemented with cognitive remediation a social skills training (IPSE), and (c) Service as usual (SAU). Health care costs, municipal social care costs, and labor market service costs were extracted from nationwide registers and combined with data on use of IPS services. Cost-utility and cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted with two primary outcomes: quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and hours in employment. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were computed for both QALY, using participant''s responses to the EQ-5D questionnaire, and for hours in employment. RESULTS: Both IPS and IPSE were less costly, and more effective than SAU. Overall, there was a statistically significant cost difference of €9,543 when comparing IPS with SAU and €7,288 when comparing IPSE with SAU. ICER''s did generally not render statistically significant results. However, there was a tendency toward the IPS and IPSE interventions being dominant, that is, cheaper with greater effect in health-related quality of life and hours in employment or education compared to usual care.

24409,"Economic Evaluation of Factorial Trials: Cost-Utility Analysis of the Atorvastatin in Factorial With Omega EE90 Risk Reduction in Diabetes 2 × 2 × 2 Factorial Trial of Atorvastatin, Omega-3 Fish Oil, and Action Planning","OBJECTIVES: We applied principles for conducting economic evaluations of factorial trials to a trial-based economic evaluation of a cluster-randomized 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin, omega-3 fish oil, and an action-planning leaflet, alone and in combination, from a UK National Health Service perspective. METHODS: The Atorvastatin in Factorial With Omega EE90 Risk Reduction in Diabetes (AFORRD) Trial randomized 800 patients with type 2 diabetes to atorvastatin, omega-3, or their respective placebos and randomized general practices to receive a leaflet-based action-planning intervention designed to improve compliance or standard care. The trial was conducted at 59 UK general practices. Sixteen-week outcomes for each trial participant were extrapolated for 70 years using the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model v2.01. We analyzed the trial as a 2 × 2 factorial trial (ignoring interactions between action-planning leaflet and medication), as a 2 × 2 × 2 factorial trial (considering all interactions), and ignoring all interactions. RESULTS: We observed several qualitative interactions for costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) that changed treatment rankings. However, different approaches to analyzing the factorial design did not change the conclusions. There was a =99% chance that atorvastatin is cost-effective and omega-3 is not, at a £20?000/QALY threshold.

24412,Cost-effectiveness of Osimertinib vs Docetaxel-bevacizumab in Third-line Treatment in EGFR T790M Resistance Mutation Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in China,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib vs docetaxel and bevacizumab in third-line treatment in EGFR T790M resistance mutation advanced non-small cell lung cancer in China from the perspective of the health care system. METHODS: To explore modeling uncertainty, 2 different model methods (a Markov model and a partitioned survival [PS] model) were developed to simulate costs and health outcomes during a lifetime. Both models consisted of 3 health states: progression-free survival, postprogression survival, and death. Efficacy and safety data of osimertinib vs docetaxel and bevacizumab in patients who had acquired EGFR T790M resistance mutation were derived from a key head-to-head clinical trial. Cost and utility values were derived from local charges, the literature, the China Drug Bidding Database, and patients'' health care documents. Two scenario analyses and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the robustness of the results. FINDINGS: In the Markov model, compared with docetaxel and bevacizumab, osimertinib yielded 0.69 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an additional cost (in US dollars) of $17,311 for an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $25,463 per QALY. In the PS model, osimertinib yielded an additional 0.69 QALYs with an incremental cost of $17,827 for an ICUR of $25,951 per QALY. From the Markov model, the ICUR was $29,416 per QALY in scenario 1 and $25,543 per QALY in scenario 2. From the PS model, the ICUR was $30,264 per QALY and $25,947 per QALY for scenarios 1 and 2, respectively. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, osimertinib treatment had a 21%-63% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $9777 to $29,330 per QALY (1-3 times the gross domestic product per capita).

24414,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a community paramedicine programme for low-income seniors living in subsidised housing: the community paramedicine at clinic programme (CP@clinic),"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Community Paramedicine at Clinic (CP@clinic) programme compared with usual care in seniors residing in subsidised housing. DESIGN: A cost-utility analysis was conducted within a large pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). Subsidised housing buildings were matched by sociodemographics and location (rural/urban), and allocated to intervention (CP@clinic for 1?year) or control (usual care) via computer-assisted paired randomisation. SETTING: Thirty-two subsidised seniors'' housing buildings in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Building residents 55 years and older. INTERVENTION: CP@clinic is a weekly community paramedic-led, chronic disease prevention and health promotion programme in the building common areas. CP@clinic is free to residents and includes risk assessments, referrals to resources, and reports back to family physicians. OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, measured with EQ-5D-3L. QALYs were estimated using area-under-the curve over the 1-year intervention, controlling for preintervention utility scores and building pairings. Programme cost data were collected before and during implementation. Costs associated with emergency medical services (EMS) use were estimated. An incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on incremental costs and health outcomes between groups was calculated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using bootstrapping was performed. RESULTS: The RCT included 1461 residents; 146 and 125 seniors completed the EQ-5D-3L in intervention and control buildings, respectively. There was a significant adjusted mean QALY gain of 0.03 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.05) for the intervention group. Total programme cost for implementing in five communities was $C128?462 and the reduction in EMS calls avoided an estimated $C256?583. The ICER was $C2933/QALY (bootstrapped mean ICER with Fieller''s 95%?CI was $4850 ($2246 to $12?396)) but could be even more cost effective after accounting for the EMS call reduction. CONCLUSION: The CP@clinic ICER was well below the commonly used Canadian cost-utility threshold of $C50?000. CP@clinic scale-up across subsidised housing is feasible and could result in better health-related quality-of-life and reduced EMS use in low-income seniors.

We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the second-line anti-diabetic therapy in T2DM patients inadequately controlled on metformin (MET) in Taiwan from the perspective of the National Health Insurance (NHI). METHODS: The Cardiff T2DM model was used to predict the occurrence of mortality, diabetes-related complications, and drug adverse events. Five second-line treatments were selected for the analysis: sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2-i), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RA), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4-i), sulfonylurea (SU), and insulin (INS). Treatment efficacy data were obtained from meta-analyses and randomized clinical trials, whereas cost data were derived from the NHI databases. RESULTS: The analysis found that SU?+?MET (DPP-4-i as triple therapy) had the lowest cost, and SU?+?MET (SGLT-2-i as triple therapy) was associated with a mean incremental benefit of 0.47 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of NT$2769, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NT$5840/QALY. Compared to their next less costly strategies, SGLT-2-i?+?MET (SU as triple therapy) and SGLT-2-i?+?MET (DPP-4-i as triple therapy) had ICER values of NT$63,170/QALY and NT$64,090/QALY, respectively. These results were fairly robust to extensive sensitivity analyses, but were relatively sensitive to baseline HbA1c, HbA1c threshold, and utilities.

Compared to their next less costly strategies, SGLT-2-i?+?MET (SU as triple therapy) and SGLT-2-i?+?MET (DPP-4-i as triple therapy) had ICER values of NT$63,170/QALY and NT$64,090/QALY, respectively. These results were fairly robust to extensive sensitivity analyses, but were relatively sensitive to baseline HbA1c, HbA1c threshold, and utilities. CONCLUSION: The addition of either SU or SGLT-2-i to MET was found to be cost-effective, using the 2019 forecast for GDP per capita of Taiwan (NT$770,770) as the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold.",2020-01-34181,32851879,Curr Med Res Opin,Ching-Lun Chien,2020,36 / 10,1619-1626,No,32851879,"Ching-Lun Chien; Yen-Chou Chen; Daniel C Malone; Yueh-Lung Peng; Yu Ko; Cost-utility analysis of second-line anti-diabetic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin, Curr Med Res Opin, 2020 Oct; 36(10):0300-7995; 1619-1626",QALY,Taiwan,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist + metformin --> sulfonylurea --> metformin + insulin vs. sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor + metformin --> dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor --> metformin + insulin,inadequately controlled on metformin,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,-1727915.79,Taiwan,2019,-56600.5
24422,An analysis of the cost-effectiveness of transcatheter mitral valve repair for people with secondary mitral valve regurgitation in the UK,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: A proportion of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients will experience regurgitation secondary to ventricular remodeling in CHF, known as functional mitral (MR) or tricuspid (TR) regurgitation. Its presence adversely impacts the prognosis and healthcare utilization in CHF patients. The advent of interventional devices for both atrioventricular valves modifies both aspects. We present an economic model structure suitable for comparing interventions used in MR and TR, and assess the cost-effectiveness of transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) plus guideline directed medical therapy (GDMT) compared with GDMT alone in people with MR. METHODS: An economic model with a lifetime time horizon was developed based on extrapolated survival data and using New York Heart Association classifications to describe disease severity in people with functional MR at high risk of surgical mortality or deemed inoperable. Cost and utility values (describing health-related quality-of-life) were assigned to patients dependent on their disease severity. The analysis was conducted from a UK National Health Service perspective. An incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was estimated, and sensitivity (one-way and probabilistic) and scenario analyses conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Compared with GDMT, the use of TMVr results in an additional 1.07 QALYs and an increase in costs of £32,267 per patient over a lifetime time horizon. The estimated incremental cost per QALY gained is £30,057 and would therefore be on the threshold of cost-effectiveness at £30,000 per quality adjusted life year. Thus, from a UK reimbursement perspective, in patients with severe functional MR who are at high risk of surgical mortality or deemed inoperable with conventional surgery, TMVr plus medical therapy is likely to represent a cost-effective treatment option compared with GDMT alone.

24429,The cost-effectiveness of transurethral resection of the prostate vs thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate in the UNBLOCS randomised controlled trial for benign prostatic obstruction,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the current ''gold standard'' operation of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) compared to the new laser technique of thulium laser transurethral vaporesection of the prostate (ThuVARP) in men with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO) within the UK National Health Service (NHS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trial was conducted across seven UK centres (four university teaching hospitals and three district general hospitals). A total of 410 men aged =18 years presenting with either bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) or urinary retention secondary to BPO, and suitable for surgery, were randomised (whilst under anaesthetic) 1:1 to receive the TURP or ThuVARP procedure. Resource use in relation to the operation, initial inpatient stay, and subsequent use of NHS services was collected for 12 months from randomisation (equivalent to primary effectiveness outcome) using hospital records and patient questionnaires. Resources were valued using UK reference costs. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from the EuroQoL five Dimensions five Levels (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire completed at baseline, 3- and 12-months. Total adjusted mean costs, QALYs and incremental Net Monetary Benefit statistics were calculated: cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty. RESULTS: The total adjusted mean secondary care cost over the 12 months in the TURP arm (£4244) was £9 (95% CI -£376, £359) lower than the ThuVARP arm (£4253). The ThuVARP operation took on average 21 min longer than TURP. The adjusted mean difference of QALYs (0.01 favouring TURP, 95% CI -0.01, 0.04) was similar between the arms. There is a 76% probability that TURP is the cost-effective option compared with ThuVARP at the £20 000 per QALY willingness to pay threshold used by National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). CONCLUSION: One of the anticipated benefits of the laser surgery, reduced length of hospital stay with an associated reduction in cost, did not materialise within the study. The longer duration of the ThuVARP procedure is important to consider, both from a patient perspective in terms of increased time under anaesthetic, and from a service delivery perspective.

24430,Economic evaluation of extended electrocardiogram monitoring for atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke,"BACKGROUND: Timely identification of occult atrial fibrillation following cryptogenic stroke facilitates consideration of oral anticoagulation therapy. Extended electrocardiography monitoring beyond 24 to 48?h Holter monitoring improves atrial fibrillation detection rates, yet uncertainty remains due to upfront costs and the projected long-term benefit. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of three electrocardiography monitoring strategies in detecting atrial fibrillation after cryptogenic stroke. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was used to project the costs and outcomes of three different electrocardiography monitoring strategies (i.e. 30-day electrocardiography monitoring, three-year implantable loop recorder monitoring, and conventional Holter monitoring) in acute stroke survivors without previously documented atrial fibrillation. RESULTS: The lifetime discounted costs and quality-adjusted life years were $206,385 and 7.77 quality-adjusted life years for conventional monitoring, $207,080 and 7.79 quality-adjusted life years for 30-day extended electrocardiography monitoring, and $210,728 and 7.88 quality-adjusted life years for the implantable loop recorder strategy. Additional quality-adjusted life years could be attained at a more favorable incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year with the implantable loop recorder strategy, compared with the 30-day electrocardiography monitoring strategy, thereby eliminating the 30-day strategy by extended dominance. The implantable loop recorder strategy was associated with an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of $40,796 compared with conventional monitoring. One-way sensitivity analyses indicated that the model was most sensitive to the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke. CONCLUSIONS: An implantable loop recorder strategy for detection of occult atrial fibrillation in patients with cryptogenic stroke is more economically attractive than 30-day electrocardiography monitoring compared to conventional monitoring and is associated with a cost per quality-adjusted life year gained in the range of other publicly funded therapies.

24432,Evaluating the Cost-Effectiveness of the ABCDE Bundle: Impact of Bundle Adherence on Inpatient and 1-Year Mortality and Costs of Care,"OBJECTIVES: Growing evidence supports the Awakening and Breathing Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management, and Early exercise/mobility (ABCDE) bundle processes as improving a number of short- and long-term clinical outcomes for patients requiring ICU care. To assess the cost-effectiveness of this intervention, we determined the impact of ABCDE bundle adherence on inpatient and 1-year mortality, quality-adjusted life-years, length of stay, and costs of care. DESIGN: We conducted a 2-year, prospective, cost-effectiveness study in 12 adult ICUs in six hospitals belonging to a large, integrated healthcare delivery system. SETTING: Hospitals included a large, urban tertiary referral center and five community hospitals. ICUs included medical/surgical, trauma, neurologic, and cardiac care units. PATIENTS: The study included 2,953 patients, 18 years old or older, with an ICU stay greater than 24 hours, who were on a ventilator for more than 24 hours and less than 14 days. INTERVENTION: ABCDE bundle. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We used propensity score-adjusted regression models to determine the impact of high bundle adherence on inpatient mortality, discharge status, length of stay, and costs. A Markov model was used to estimate the potential effect of improved bundle adherence on healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life-years in the year following ICU admission. We found that patients with high ABCDE bundle adherence (= 60%) had significantly decreased odds of inpatient mortality (odds ratio 0.28) and significantly higher costs ($3,920) of inpatient care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of high bundle adherence was $15,077 (95% CI, $13,675-$16,479) per life saved and $1,057 per life-year saved. High bundle adherence was associated with a 0.12 increase in quality-adjusted life-years, a $4,949 increase in 1-year care costs, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $42,120 per quality-adjusted life-year.

24433,Cost-effectiveness of Capecitabine + Irinotecan Versus Leucovorin + Fluorouracil + Irinotecan in the Second-line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in China,"PURPOSE: The AXEPT trial demonstrated that modified XELIRI (mXELIRI; capecitabine + irinotecan) was noninferior to standard treatment with FOLFIRI (fluorouracil + leucovorin + irinotecan), both ± bevacizumab, in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The present study was designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mXELIRI versus FOLFIRI as a second-line treatment of mCRC. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to estimate the costs and health outcomes of mXELIRI and FOLFIRI in patients with mCRC from the Chinese payer perspective. Survival data, transition probabilities, and health utility values were obtained from published studies. The costs of drugs were obtained from the West China Hospital. Life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) values were regarded as the primary end points. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to evaluate the impact of uncertainty of parameters in the analysis. FINDINGS: The effectiveness was found to be 0.48 QALYs (1.14 LYs) in the mXELIRI arm and 0.41 QALYs (1.05 LYs) in the FOLFIRI arm, with total costs of 29,896.41 US dollars (USD) in the mXELIRI arm and 28,894.68 USD in the FOLFIRI arm. The ICER and ICUR with mXELIRI versus FOLFIRI were 11,130.33 USD/LY and 14,310.43 USD/QALY gained, which were less than the willingness-to-pay threshold in China (25,840.88 USD/QALY). IMPLICATIONS: Based on the results of this study, mXELIRI was found to be a cost-effective alternative to FOLFIRI as a second-line treatment of mCRC in patients in China.",2020-01-34205,32981743,Clin Ther,Qiuji Wu,2020,42 / 11,2148-2158.e2,Yes,32981743,"Qiuji Wu; Pengfei Zhang; Xinyuan Wang; Mengxi Zhang; Weiting Liao; Qiu Li; Cost-effectiveness of Capecitabine + Irinotecan Versus Leucovorin + Fluorouracil + Irinotecan in the Second-line Treatment of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in China, Clin Ther, 2020 Nov; 42(11):1879-114X; 2148-2158.e2",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,capecitabine + irinotecan +/- bevacizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- 180 mg/m^2 irinotecan + 200 mg/ m^2 leucovorin + 400 mg/m^2 fluorouracil on day 1 --> 46-hour continuus infusion of 2400 mg/m^2 fluorouracil repeated every 2 weeks +/- 5 mg/kg bevacizumab on day 1,"metastatic disease, withdrwarn from first-line chemotherapy",Not Stated,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,14310.43,United States,2018,14749.48

24435,Cost-effectiveness of the Namaste care family program for nursing home residents with advanced dementia in comparison with usual care: a cluster-randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a progressive disease that decreases quality of life of persons with dementia and is associated with high societal costs. The burden of caring for persons with dementia also decreases the quality of life of family caregivers. The objective of this study was to assess the societal cost-effectiveness of Namaste Care Family program in comparison with usual care in nursing home residents with advanced dementia. METHODS: Nursing homes were randomized to either Namaste Care Family program or usual care. Outcome measures of the cluster-randomized trial in 231 residents included Quality of Life in Late-Stage Dementia (QUALID) and the Gain in Alzheimer Care Instrument (GAIN) for family caregivers over 12?months of follow-up. Health states were measured using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire which were translated into utilities. QALYs were calculated by multiplying the amount of time a participant spent in a specific health state with the utility score associated with that health state. Healthcare utilization costs were estimated using standard unit costs, while intervention costs were estimated using a bottom-up approach. Missing cost and effect data were imputed using multiple imputation. Bootstrapped multilevel models were used after multiple imputation. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. RESULTS: The Namaste Care Family program was more effective than usual care in terms of QUALID (-?0.062, 95%CI: -?0.40 to 0.28), QALY (0.0017, 95%CI: -?0.059 to 0.063) and GAIN (0.075, 95%CI: -?0.20 to 0.35). Total societal costs were lower for the Namaste Care Family program as compared to usual care (-?552 €, 95%CI: -?2920 to 1903). However, these differences were not statistically significant. The probability of cost-effectiveness at a ceiling ratio of 0 €/unit of effect extra was 0.70 for the QUALID, QALY and GAIN. CONCLUSIONS: The Namaste Care Family program is dominant over usual care and, thus, cost-effective, although statistical uncertainty was considerable.

24436,The integrated care pathway for managing post stroke patients (iCaPPS(©)) in public primary care Healthcentres in Malaysia: impact on quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The delivery of post stroke care is fragmented even in advanced public healthcare systems, globally. Primary care teams are entrusted to provide longer term care for stroke survivors in most developing countries. The integrated Care Pathway for Post Stroke patients (iCaPPS(©)) was designed to guide primary care teams to incorporate further rehabilitation and regular screening for post stroke complications among patients residing at home in communities, using the shared-care approach, especially in areas with limited access to specialist stroke care services. The iCaPPS(©) addressed coordination of rehabilitation and screening for post stroke complications which were absent in the current conventional care of patients managed at public primary care healthcentres. This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness and impact of iCaPPS(©) on quality-adjusted- life-years (QALY) compared with current conventional monitoring at public primary care healthcentres. METHODS: A pragmatic healthcentre-based cluster randomised controlled trial-within trial on 151 post stroke patients from 10 public primary care facilities in Peninsular Malaysia was conducted to evaluate QALY of patients managed with iCaPPS(©) (n?=?86) vs conventional care (n?=?65) for 6?months. Costs from societal perspective were calculated, using combination of top down and activity-based costing methods. The 5-level EQ5D (EQ-5D-5?L) was used to calculate health state utility scores. Cost per QALY and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) were determined. Differences within groups were determined using Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: Total costs for 6?months treatment with iCaPPS(©) was MYR790.34, while conventional care cost MYR527.22. Median QALY for iCaPPS(©) was 0.55 (0,1.65) compared to conventional care 0.32 (0, 0.73) (z?=?-?0.21, p?=?0.84). Cost per QALY for iCaPPS(©) was MYR1436.98, conventional care was MYR1647.56. The ICER was MYR1144.00, equivalent to 3.7% of per capita GDP (2012 prices). CONCLUSIONS: Management of post stroke patients in the community using iCaPPS(©) costs less per QALY compared to current conventional care and is very cost effective.

24437,Minimally Invasive Sacroiliac Joint Fusion with Triangular Titanium Implants: Cost-Utility Analysis from NHS Perspective,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to identify the cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion (MI SIJF) surgery with titanium triangular implants for patients with sacroiliac joint (SIJ) pain who have failed conservative management, compared to non-surgical management (NSM) from a National Health Service (NHS) England perspective. METHODS: Over a time horizon of 5 years, a cohort state transition model compared the costs and outcomes of treating patients with MI SIJF to those of traditional NSM treatment pathways. The NSM arm included two treatments: grouped physical therapy and corticosteroid injections (PTSI) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Three different strategies were considered: (1) a stepped pathway, (2) patients split between PTSI and RFA, and (3) RFA only. The outcome measure was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), reported in 2018 British pounds per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: Patients undergoing MI SIJF accrued total procedure-related and pain-management costs of £8358, while NSM treatment strategy 1 had total costs of £6880. The MI SIJF cohort had 2.98 QALYs compared to strategy 1 with 2.30 QALYs. This resulted in an ICER for MI SIJF versus strategy 1 of £2164/QALY gained. Strategy 2 of the NSM arm had lower costs than strategy 1 (£6564) and 2.26 QALYs, and this resulted in an ICER of £2468/QALY gained for MI SIJF.

24440,Evaluating the Use of microRNA Blood Tests for Gastric Cancer Screening in a Stratified Population-Level Screening Program: An Early Model-Based Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate cost-effectiveness of a novel screening strategy using a microRNA (miRNA) blood test as a screen, followed by endoscopy for diagnosis confirmation in a 3-yearly population screening program for gastric cancer. METHODS: A Markov cohort model has been developed in Microsoft Excel 2016 for the population identified to be at intermediate risk (Singaporean men, aged 50-75 years with Chinese ethnicity). The interventions compared were (1) initial screening using miRNA test followed by endoscopy for test-positive individuals and a 3-yearly follow-up screening for test-negative individuals (proposed strategy), and (2) no screening with gastric cancer being diagnosed clinically (current practice). The model was evaluated for 25 years with a healthcare perspective and accounted for test characteristics, compliance, disease progression, cancer recurrence, costs, utilities, and mortality. The outcomes measured included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, cancer stage at diagnosis, and thresholds for significant variables. RESULTS: The miRNA-based screening was found to be cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $40 971/quality-adjusted life-year. Key drivers included test costs, test accuracy, cancer incidence, and recurrence risk. Threshold analysis highlights the need for high accuracy of miRNA tests (threshold sensitivity: 68%; threshold specificity: 77%). A perfect compliance to screening would double the cancer diagnosis in early stages compared to the current practice. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis reported the miRNA-based screening to be cost-effective in >95% of iterations for a willingness to pay of $70 000/quality-adjusted life-year (approximately equivalent to 1 gross domestic product/capita) CONCLUSIONS: The miRNA-based screening intervention was found to be cost-effective and is expected to contribute immensely in early diagnosis of cancer by improving screening compliance.",2020-01-34227,32940235,Value Health,Ritika Kapoor,2020,23 / 9,1171-1179,Yes,32940235,"Ritika Kapoor; Jimmy B Y So; Feng Zhu; Heng-Phon Too; Khay-Guan Yeoh; Joanne Su-Yin Yoong; Evaluating the Use of microRNA Blood Tests for Gastric Cancer Screening in a Stratified Population-Level Screening Program: An Early Model-Based Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Value Health, 2020 Sep; 23(9):1098-3015; 1171-1179",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Medical Procedure, Screening",microrna blood test + confirmatory endoscopy vs. None,chinese ethnicity,75 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,25 Years,3.00,3.00,40971,United States,2018,42228

However, in recent years, there has been significant progressive increases in pneumococcal disease attributed to serotypes 3, 6A, and 19A, which are covered by the 13-valent PCV (PCV13). We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of switching from PCV10 to PCV13 for Brazilian infants from a payer perspective. A decision-analytic model was adapted to evaluate the clinical and economic outcomes of continuing PCV10 or switching to PCV13. The analysis estimated future costs ($BRL), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and health outcomes for PCV10 and PCV13 over 5 y. Input parameters were from published sources. Future serotype dynamics were predicted using Brazilian and global historical trends. Over 5 y, PCV13 could prevent 12,342 bacteremia, 15,330 meningitis, 170,191 hospitalized pneumonia, and 25,872 otitis media cases, avert 13,709 pneumococcal disease deaths, gain 20,317 QALYs, and save 172 million direct costs compared with PCV10.

The objective of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost-utility of SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres relative to best supportive care (BSC) in the treatment of chemotherapy refractory mCRC from the perspective of the UK national healthcare payer. METHODS: A cost-utility model was developed in Microsoft Excel to simulate transitions from progression-free survival to post-progression survival and death in patients with mCRC. Unit costs were captured in 2019 pounds sterling (GBP) based on the literature, formulary listings, and National Health Service (NHS) England reference costs. Future costs and effects were discounted at 3.5% per annum. A series of one-way sensitivity analyses, and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres would result in an increase in discounted quality-adjusted life years gained from 0.69 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) to 1.50 QALYs, with an associated increase in cost from GBP 15,268 to GBP 34,168 yielding an incremental cost-utility ratio of GBP 23,435 per QALY. PSA showed that there would be a 56% likelihood that SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres would be cost-effective relative to BSC at a willingness-to-pay threshold of GBP 30,000 per QALY gained.

RESULTS: One hundred and thirteen patients (VLP n = 58, EF n = 55) had complete data until 3 years and were used in the analysis. At one year, the VLP group had a mean incremental cost of 878 euros and a gain of 0.020 QALYs compared with the EF group, rendering an ICER of 43 900 euros per QALY. At three years, the VLP group had a mean incremental cost of 1 082 euros and a negative incremental effect of -0.005 QALYs compared to the EF group, which means that VLP was dominated by EF. The probability that VLP was cost-effective compared to EF at three years, was lower than 50% independent of the willingness to pay per QALY.

24447,Cost-Effectiveness of Immediate Magnetic Resonance Imaging In the Management of Patients With Suspected Scaphoid Fracture: Results From a Randomized Clinical Trial,"OBJECTIVES: Given the limited diagnostic accuracy of radiographs on presentation to the emergency department (ED), the management of suspected scaphoid fractures remains clinically challenging and poses an unknown economic burden to healthcare systems. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of immediate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the management of patients presenting with suspected scaphoid fracture to an ED in England. METHODS: A pragmatic, randomized, single-center trial compared the use of immediate MRI in the ED against standard care with radiographs only. Participants'' use of healthcare services and costs were estimated from primary care and secondary care databases and questionnaires at baseline, 1, 3, and 6 months postrecruitment. Costs were compared using generalized linear models and combined with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs, based on the EQ-5D-5L) to estimate cost-effectiveness at 6 months postrecruitment. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and bootstrapping techniques were used to estimate the probability of cost-effectiveness at different willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. Four deterministic sensitivity scenarios were considered around key parameters. RESULTS: The MRI intervention dominated standard care in the base case and all 4 deterministic sensitivity scenarios, costing less and achieving more QALY gains, with a probability of 100% of being cost-effective at 6 months using the conventional United Kingdom WTP thresholds of £20?000 to £30?000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: The use of immediate MRI is a cost-effective intervention in the management of suspected scaphoid fractures in a Central Hospital in London.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban vs warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation with varying stroke/bleed risk profiles over a lifetime horizon. METHODS: A Markov micro-simulation was adapted to examine the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted survival of five anticoagulants from a US private payer''s perspective. The study hypothetical cohort consisted of 10,000 patients with atrial fibrillation with age, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc, and HAS-BLED scores similar to a commercially insured patient with atrial fibrillation cohort. Model input parameters including the efficacy and safety of each strategy, utilities, and cost were estimated from public sources, published literature, and analysis conducted in the IBM MarketScan database. Lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were assessed for each treatment strategy. Subgroup analyses stratified by age, stroke risk score alone, bleed risk score alone and both were performed. Uncertainty was assessed by a deterministic sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The base-case analysis suggested dabigatran was the optimal treatment with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $35,055 per quality-adjusted life-year relative to warfarin. Subgroup analyses stratified by age, stroke risk score, and bleed risk score alone were largely consistent with the base-case analysis. Subgroup analyses stratified by both stroke and bleed risk score showed edoxaban was the preferred treatment in patients with a low stroke and a low or medium bleed risk, and patients with a high stroke and low bleed risk. Apixaban was the preferred treatment in patients with a medium stroke and high bleed risk. Results of the deterministic sensitivity analysis indicate the model results were most sensitive to the drug cost and hazard ratio for stroke and bleeding event. Results of the probability sensitivity analysis showed dabigatran is cost effective vs. other treatments in 32.8% and 42.4% of iterations at a willingness to pay of $50,000/quality-adjusted life-year and a willingness to pay of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year, respectively.

Subgroup analyses stratified by both stroke and bleed risk score showed edoxaban was the preferred treatment in patients with a low stroke and a low or medium bleed risk, and patients with a high stroke and low bleed risk. Apixaban was the preferred treatment in patients with a medium stroke and high bleed risk. Results of the deterministic sensitivity analysis indicate the model results were most sensitive to the drug cost and hazard ratio for stroke and bleeding event. Results of the probability sensitivity analysis showed dabigatran is cost effective vs. other treatments in 32.8% and 42.4% of iterations at a willingness to pay of $50,000/quality-adjusted life-year and a willingness to pay of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year, respectively.

24454,Updating the Cost Effectiveness of Oral Anticoagulants for Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Based on Varying Stroke and Bleed Risk Profiles,"BACKGROUND: Previous investigations into the cost effectiveness of direct oral anticoagulants only considered individual stroke risk but not bleed risk even though bleeding is an important and potentially fatal side effect for anticoagulated patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban vs warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation with varying stroke/bleed risk profiles over a lifetime horizon. METHODS: A Markov micro-simulation was adapted to examine the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted survival of five anticoagulants from a US private payer''s perspective. The study hypothetical cohort consisted of 10,000 patients with atrial fibrillation with age, CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc, and HAS-BLED scores similar to a commercially insured patient with atrial fibrillation cohort. Model input parameters including the efficacy and safety of each strategy, utilities, and cost were estimated from public sources, published literature, and analysis conducted in the IBM MarketScan database. Lifetime cost, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were assessed for each treatment strategy. Subgroup analyses stratified by age, stroke risk score alone, bleed risk score alone and both were performed. Uncertainty was assessed by a deterministic sensitivity analysis and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The base-case analysis suggested dabigatran was the optimal treatment with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $35,055 per quality-adjusted life-year relative to warfarin.

The Improve SCA study has identified a cohort of patients called 1.5 primary prevention (1.5PP) based on PP patients with the presence of certain risk factors. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ICD therapy compared to no ICD among the PP population and the subset of 1.5PP patients in Taiwan. METHODS: A Markov model was run over a lifetime time horizon from the Taiwan payer perspective. Mortality and utility estimates were obtained from the literature (PP) and the IMPROVE SCA trial (1.5PP). Cost inputs were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA), Ministry of Health and Welfare. We used a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of NT$2,100,000, as established through standard WTP research methods and in alignment with World Health Organization recommendations. RESULTS: The total discounted costs for ICD therapy and no ICD therapy were NT$1,664,259 and NT$646,396 respectively for PP, while they were NT$2,410,603 and NT$905,881 respectively for 1.5PP.

24459,Evaluation of a Heart Failure Telemonitoring Program Through a Microsimulation Model: Cost-Utility Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a major public health issue in Canada that is associated with high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates and high financial and social burdens. Telemonitoring (TM) has been shown to improve all-cause mortality and hospitalization rates in patients with HF. The Medly program is a TM intervention integrated as standard of care at a large Canadian academic hospital for ambulatory patients with HF that has been found to improve patient outcomes. However, the cost-effectiveness of the Medly program is yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to conduct a cost-utility analysis of the Medly program compared with the standard of care for HF in Ontario, Canada, from the perspective of the public health care payer. METHODS: Using a microsimulation model, individual patient data were simulated over a 25-year time horizon to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between the Medly program and standard care for patients with HF treated in the ambulatory care setting. Data were sourced from a Medly Program Evaluation study and literature to inform model parameters, such as Medly''s effectiveness in reducing mortality and hospitalizations, health care and intervention costs, and model transition probabilities. Scenario analyses were conducted in relation to HF severity and TM deployment models. One-way deterministic effectiveness analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to explore the impact on the results of uncertainty in model parameters. RESULTS: The Medly program was associated with an average total cost of Can $102,508 (US $77,626) per patient and total QALYs of 5.51 per patient compared with the average cost of Can $97,497 (US $73,831) and QALYs of 4.95 per patient in the Standard Care Group. This led to an incremental cost of Can $5011 (US $3794) and incremental QALY of 0.566, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Can $8850 (US $6701)/QALY. Cost-effectiveness improved in relation to patients with advanced HF and with deployment models in which patients used their own equipment. Baseline and alternative scenarios consistently showed probabilities of cost-effectiveness greater than 85% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of Can $50,000 (US $37,718). Although the results showed some sensitivity to assumptions about effectiveness parameters, the intervention was found to remain cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The Medly program for patients with HF is cost-effective compared with standard care using commonly reported willingness-to-pay thresholds. This study provides evidence for decision makers on the use of TM for HF, supports the use of a nurse-led model of TM that embeds clinically validated algorithms, and informs the use of economic modeling for future evaluations of early-stage health informatics technology.",2020-01-34250,33021485,J Med Internet Res,Chris Boodoo,2020,22 / 10,e18917,No,33021485,"Chris Boodoo; Qi Zhang; Heather J Ross; Ana Carolina Alba; Audrey Laporte; Emily Seto; Evaluation of a Heart Failure Telemonitoring Program Through a Microsimulation Model: Cost-Utility Analysis, J Med Internet Res, 2020 Oct 6; 22(10):1438-8871; e18917",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Device",telemonitoring for heart failure integrated as standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard/usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,1.50,1.50,6701,United States,2018,6906.59

METHODS: A Microsoft Excel-based patient-level simulation model, based on the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial data, was adapted and used to project individual''s clinical and economic outcomes over a lifetime horizon. The cost and utility values were derived from databases and published studies. Numbers and rates of diabetes-related events, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (¥ 2019) as well as incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: Compared with BASC, empagliflozin plus BASC was predicted to result in an additional 1.01 QALYs (8.05 QALYs vs 7.04 QALYs) at an incremental cost of ¥4002 per patient. The modeled ICUR was ¥3988 per QALY gained, which was considered highly cost-effective in China compared to both one and three times the GDP per capita in 2019 (¥70,892 and ¥212,676). The deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of base-case results. CONCLUSION: This is the first cost-utility analysis regarding the use of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM in China, the world''s most affected country by the T2DM pandemic. The economic evaluation suggests that empagliflozin added to BASC was estimated to be a highly value-for-money option for the treatment of adult patients with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk in the Chinese healthcare setting.",2020-01-34255,32848438,Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,Peng Men,2020,13 /,2823-2831,No,32848438,"Peng Men; Tianbi Liu; Suodi Zhai; Arthur E Attema; Han Bleichrodt; Olivier l'Haridon; Stefan A Lipman; Rachael Maree Hunter; Victoria Vickerstaff; Michaela Poppe; Andre Strydom; Michael King; Ian Hall; Jason Crabtree; Rumana Omar; Vivien Cooper; Asit Biswas; Angela Hassiotis; Empagliflozin in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients with High Cardiovascular Risk: A Model-Based Cost-Utility Analysis in China, Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes, 2020; 13():1178-7007; 2823-2831",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,empagliflozin + best available standard care vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard/usual care,high cardiovascular risk,63 Years,63 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,3988,China,2019,584.42

METHODS: A German societal and national health service perspective was considered for three different analyses. The cost utility analysis (CUA) estimated costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based on a pre-trial decision analytic model taking a lifelong time horizon. In addition, a within trial CUA estimated QALYs and costs for 1 year. Finally, the cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) used the composite primary outcome, mortality and renal failure at 30-day follow-up, and the within trial costs. Econometric and survival analysis on the trial data was used for the estimation of the model parameters. Subgroup analysis was performed following an economic protocol. RESULTS: The lifelong CUA showed an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), CO-PCI vs. MV-PCI, of €7010 per QALY and a probability of CO-PCI being the most cost-effective strategy?>?64% at a €30,000 threshold. The ICER for the within trial CUA was €14,600 and the incremental cost per case of death/renal failure avoided at 30-day follow-up was €9010.

24463,Economic evaluation of a combined screening and stepped-care treatment program targeting psychological distress in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer: A cluster randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Psychological distress is highly prevalent among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. AIMS: To perform an economic evaluation of a combined screening and treatment program targeting psychological distress in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in comparison with usual care. DESIGN: Societal costs were collected alongside a cluster randomized controlled trial for 48?weeks. A total of 349 participants were included. SETTING: Participants were recruited from oncology departments at 16 participating hospitals in the Netherlands. METHODS: Outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and quality-adjusted life-years. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputation. Uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated to show uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness estimates. Sensitivity analyses were performed to check robustness of results. RESULTS: Between treatment arms, no significant differences were found in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score (mean difference: -0.058; 95% confidence interval: -0.13 to 0.011), quality-adjusted life-years (mean difference: 0.042; 95% confidence interval: -0.015 to 0.099), and societal costs (mean difference: -1152; 95% confidence interval: -5058 to 2214). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the probability of cost-effectiveness was 0.64 and 0.74 at willingness-to-pay values of €0 and €10,000 per point improvement on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, respectively. The probability that the intervention was cost-effective compared to usual care for quality-adjusted life-years was 0.64 and 0.79 at willingness-to-pay values of €0 and €20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. CONCLUSION: The intervention is dominant over usual care, primarily due to lower costs in the intervention group.

24464,"Health Economic Consequences of a Tightly Controlled Dose Reduction Strategy for Adalimumab, Etanercept and Ustekinumab Compared with Standard Psoriasis Care: A Cost-utility Analysis of the CONDOR Study","A dose reduction strategy for adalimumab, etanercept and ustekinumab in patients with psoriasis who have stable and low disease activity has recently been compared with usual care in the CONDOR study (CONtrolled DOse Reduction) of biologics in patients with psoriasis with low disease activity. The aim of the current study was to perform a cost-utility analysis with a 12-month time horizon alongside this trial, using prospectively measured healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life years, based on Short-Form Six-Dimension utilities. Bootstrap analys-es were used to calculate the decremental cost-utility ratio and the incremental net monetary benefit.

24465,Cost-effectiveness analysis of fruquintinib for metastatic colorectal cancer third-line treatment in China,"BACKGROUND: In this study, we analyze the cost-effectiveness of fruquintinib as third-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in China, especially after a recent price drop suggested by the National Healthcare Security Administration. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of fruquintinib compared to placebo among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The Chinese healthcare payer''s perspective was considered with a lifetime horizon, including direct medical cost (2019 US dollars [USD]). A willing-to-pay threshold was set at USD 27,130/QALY, which is three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. We examined the robustness of the model in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Fruquintinib was associated with better health outcomes than placebo (0.640 vs 0.478 QALYs) with a higher cost (USD 20750.9 vs USD 12042.2), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD 53508.7 per QALY. This ICER is 25% lower than the one calculated before the price drop (USD 70952.6 per QALY). CONCLUSION: After the price negotiation, the drug becomes cheaper and the ICER is lower, but the drug is still not cost effective under the standard of 3 times GDP willing-to-pay threshold. For patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in China, fruquintinib is not a cost-effective option under the current circumstances in China.",2020-01-34328,33050905,BMC Cancer,Zhi Peng,2020,20 / 1,990,No,33050905,"Zhi Peng; Xingduo Hou; Yangmu Huang; Tong Xie; Xinyang Hua; Cost-effectiveness analysis of fruquintinib for metastatic colorectal cancer third-line treatment in China, BMC Cancer, 2020 Jun 26; 20(1):1471-2407; 990",QALY,China,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,fruquintinib vs. Placebo,previously progressed after at least 2 lines of chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,53508.7,United States,2019,54168.83
24466,Cost-effectiveness analysis of rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin alone in secondary prevention among patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin alone for patients with stable cardiovascular diseases in the Taiwan setting. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to project the lifetime direct medical costs and quality-adjusted life-years of both therapies. Transitional probabilities were derived from the COMPASS trial, and the costs and utilities were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Database and published studies. One-way, scenario, subgroup, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was presented as the outcome. The threshold of willingness-to-pay was set at US$76,368 (3 times the gross domestic product per capita of Taiwan). All analyses were operated by TreeAge 2019 and Microsoft Excel. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of rivaroxaban plus aspirin versus aspirin alone in the patients with stable cardiovascular diseases, coronary artery diseases, and peripheral artery diseases were US$83,459, US$69,852 and -US$13,823 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. The probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the probabilities of cost-effectiveness for the regimen with rivaroxaban among those with cardiovascular diseases and coronary artery diseases were 44.1% and 65.3% at US$76,368. CONCLUSION: Low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin is less likely to be a cost-effective alternative to aspirin in secondary prevention for the patients with stable cardiovascular diseases; however, among these patients, the regimen may have pharmacoeconomic incentives for the group merely having chronic coronary artery diseases from the Taiwan national payer''s perspective.

24471,Cost Effectiveness of Whole Population BRCA Genetic Screening for Cancer Prevention in Israel,"With the growing technical ease and reduction in genetic screening costs, whole population BRCA screening may be a feasible option. Our objective was to investigate the cost effectiveness of whole population screening for BRCA mutations in Israel, for varying degrees of BRCA carrier state. Lifetime costs of whole female population screening for BRCA mutation carrier state versus nonscreening were compared using a Markovian process decision analysis model. Model parameters including ovarian and breast cancer risks were obtained from previously published data. Screening and other treatment-related costs were received from the Israeli Ministry of Health pricing list according to specified codes. Quality-adjusted life years were used for cost-effectiveness analysis. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate model uncertainties, specifically varying degrees of BRCA prevalence. Results show that whole population BRCA screening in Israel is cost effective across a wide range of BRCA prevalence rates with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 81,493 new Israeli Shekels for a BRCA prevalence of 2.5%, increasing to 250,000 new Israeli Shekels for a 0.75% prevalence rate, per quality-adjusted life year gained. Discount rate and population BRCA prevalence and rate of risk reduction salpingo-oophorectomy are the most influential parameters in the model. Whole population screening for BRCA mutations should be offered as part of general health screening strategies by national medical insurance providers, even for non-Ashkenazi Jews. Our algorithm can be applied for other countries, adjusting local costs of screening and treatment.

24472,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Maintenance Olaparib in Patients with Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer and a Germline BRCA1/2 Mutation Based on the POLO Trial,"OBJECTIVE: The phase III POLO trial demonstrated that olaparib as maintenance therapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with a germline BRCA mutation had greater efficacy than placebo, but maintenance olaparib places an economic burden on patients. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of olaparib as maintenance therapy based on the POLO trial (NCT02184195). METHODS: A three-state Markov model (progression-free survival [PFS], progressive disease [PD] and death) based on data from the POLO trial was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of maintenance olaparib versus placebo for metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with a germline BRCA mutation. The cost was evaluated from the Chinese society''s perspective, and health outcomes were assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The primary outcome was the ICER gained in terms of 2019 US$ per QALY. Model robustness was explored with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, maintenance olaparib increased costs by $23,544.35 while gaining 0.69 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $34,122.25 per QALY. The ICER was far higher than the commonly accepted willingness-to-pay threshold ($28,255.55 per QALY).

24473,Economic evaluation of prevention of cystoid macular edema after cataract surgery in nondiabetic patients: ESCRS PREMED study report 4,"PURPOSE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic treatments against cystoid macula edema (CME) after cataract surgery in nondiabetic patients. SETTING: Seven ophthalmology clinics in the Netherlands and Belgium. DESIGN: Prospective cost-effectiveness analysis using data from a European multicenter randomized clinical trial (ESCRS PREMED). METHODS: Nondiabetic patients planned for expected uncomplicated cataract surgery were randomized to topical bromfenac (Yellox, n=242), topical dexamethasone (n=242), or a combination treatment (n=238). All relevant resources from a healthcare perspective were included in the cost analysis within a time horizon of 12 weeks postoperatively. The main effectiveness outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The main cost-effectiveness outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) based on the cost per QALY. RESULTS: The study comprised 722 nondiabetic patients. Total healthcare costs and QALYs were &OV0556; 447 (US$ 562) and 0.174 in the bromfenac group, &OV0556; 421 (US$ 529) and 0.179 in the dexamethasone group, and &OV0556; 442 (US$ 555) and 0.182 in the combination group. Bromfenac was most costly and least effective (ie, strongly dominated). The ICER was &OV0556; 6544 (US$ 8221) per QALY for the combination group compared to the dexamethasone group. Assuming the willingness-to-pay is &OV0556; 20,000 (US$ 25,126) per QALY, the cost-effectiveness probability was 3%, 32%, and 65% in the bromfenac, dexamethasone, and combination groups, respectively.

24487,Cost-effectiveness of letermovir as cytomegalovirus prophylaxis in adult recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in Hong Kong,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of letermovir as cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis in adult seropositive patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), compared with the conventional strategy of preemptive treatment, has not been evaluated in Asia. METHODS: A decision analytical model, simulating the clinical progression of CMV infection on a lifetime horizon, was developed to compare prophylactic strategy with letermovir with preemptive therapy alone as anti-CMV strategies. Prophylaxis comprised administering letermovir for 14 weeks, with clinical outcomes measured at 24?weeks, followed by preemptive therapy if CMV infection occurred. This approach was modeled on outcomes of the letermovir phase 3 clinical study. The model enumerated the cost of letermovir prophylaxis, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALYs gained with prophylaxis. The opposite arm involved regular monitoring and preemptive therapy for CMV reactivation. Real-world costs from the adult HSCT center at Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, were adopted for analysis. Costs and clinical benefits, expressed as QALYs, were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: Letermovir prophylaxis compared with preemptive therapy only would lead to an increase of life-year and QALYs at increased costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis showed that letermovir prophylaxis had an associated cost of HKD 193,580 for each life-year gained, and HKD 234,675 for each QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the majority of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio fell below the cost-effectiveness threshold of HKD 382,046 (one gross domestic product per capita) per QALY gained.

24488,Cost-effectiveness of teduglutide in pediatric patients with short bowel syndrome: Markov modeling using traditional cost-effectiveness criteria,"BACKGROUND: Teduglutide use in pediatric patients with short bowel syndrome can aid in the achievement of enteral autonomy, but with a price of >$400,000 per y. OBJECTIVE: The current study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of using teduglutide in conjunction with offering intestinal transplantation in US pediatric patients with short bowel syndrome. DESIGN: A Markov model was used to evaluate the costs (in US dollars) and effectiveness [in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] of using teduglutide compared with offering intestinal transplantation. Parameters were estimated from published data where available. The primary effect modeled was the probability of weaning from parenteral nutrition while on teduglutide. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all model parameters. RESULTS: Compared with offering only intestinal transplantation, adding teduglutide cost ${\$}$124,353/QALY gained. Reducing the cost of the medication by 16% allowed the cost to reach the typical benchmark of ${\$}$100,000/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis favored transplantation without offering teduglutide in 68% of iterations at a ${\$}$100,000/QALY threshold. Never using teduglutide created an opportunity cost of over ${\$}$100,000 per patient.

24489,Cost-effectiveness of adrenaline for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest,"BACKGROUND: The ''Prehospital Assessment of the Role of Adrenaline: Measuring the Effectiveness of Drug Administration In Cardiac Arrest'' (PARAMEDIC2) trial showed that adrenaline improves overall survival, but not neurological outcomes. We sought to determine the within-trial and lifetime health and social care costs and benefits associated with adrenaline, including secondary benefits from organ donation. METHODS: We estimated the costs, benefits (quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) associated with adrenaline during the 6-month trial follow-up. Model-based analyses explored how results altered when the time horizon was extended beyond 6 months and the scope extended to include recipients of donated organs. RESULTS: The within-trial (6?months) and lifetime horizon economic evaluations focussed on the trial population produced ICERs of £1,693,003 (€1,946,953) and £81,070 (€93,231) per QALY gained in 2017 prices, respectively, reflecting significantly higher mean costs and only marginally higher mean QALYs in the adrenaline group. The probability that adrenaline is cost-effective was less than 1% across a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds. Combined direct economic effects over the lifetimes of survivors and indirect economic effects in organ recipients produced an ICER of £16,086 (€18,499) per QALY gained for adrenaline with the probability that adrenaline is cost-effective increasing to 90% at a £30,000 (€34,500) per QALY cost-effectiveness threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Adrenaline was not cost-effective when only directly related costs and consequences are considered. However, incorporating the indirect economic effects associated with transplanted organs substantially alters cost-effectiveness, suggesting decision-makers should consider the complexity of direct and indirect economic impacts of adrenaline.

AIMS: To examine the cost-effectiveness of adding WATS(3D) to the Seattle protocol in screening patients for BE. METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of two alternative BE screening strategies in chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease patients: FB with and without WATS(3D). The reference case was a 60-year-old white male with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Effectiveness was measured by the number needed to screen to avert one cancer and one cancer-related death, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost was measured in 2019 US$, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was measured in $/QALY using thresholds for cost-effectiveness of $100,000/QALY and $150,000/QALY. Cost was measured in 2019 US$. Cost and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: Between 320 and 337 people would need to be screened with WATS(3D) in addition to FB to avert one additional cancer, and 328-367 people to avert one cancer-related death. Screening with WATS(3D) costs an additional $1219 and produced an additional 0.017 QALYs, for an ICER of $71,395/QALY. All one-way sensitivity analyses resulted in ICERs under $84,000/QALY.

24493,A Cost-Utility Analysis Comparing Immediate Oncoplastic Surgery with Delayed Oncoplastic Surgery in Smoking Breast Cancer Patients,"BACKGROUND: Oncoplastic reduction mammoplasty for smoking breast cancer patients committed to smoking cessation may be performed immediately (increasing smoking-related risk) or in a delayed fashion (increasing radiation-related risk). OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to examine the cost utility of immediate versus delayed oncoplastic reconstruction when operating on a smoking patient with breast cancer and macromastia with a long-term commitment to smoking cessation. METHODS: A literature review determined the probabilities and outcomes for the treatment of unilateral breast cancer with immediate or delayed oncoplastic surgery. Reported utility scores were used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for varying health states. A decision analysis tree was constructed with rollback analysis to highlight the more cost-effective strategy, and an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Immediate oncoplastic surgery is associated with a higher clinical effectiveness (QALY) of 33.3 compared with delayed oncoplastic surgery (33.26), with a higher increment of clinical effectiveness of 0.07 and relative cost reduction of $3458.11. This resulted in a negative ICUR of -50,194, which favored immediate reconstruction, indicating a dominant strategy. In one-way sensitivity analyses, delayed reconstruction was the more cost-effective strategy if the probability of successful immediate reconstruction falls below 29% or its cost exceeds $29,611. Monte-Carlo analysis showed a confidence of 99% that immediate oncoplastic surgery is more cost effective.

24494,Cost and health impacts of adherence to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence schizophrenia guideline recommendations,"BACKGROUND: Discrepancies between the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) schizophrenia guideline recommendations and current clinical practice in the UK have been reported. AIMS: We aim to assess whether it is cost-effective to improve adherence to the NICE schizophrenia guideline recommendations, compared with current practice. METHOD: A previously developed whole-disease model for schizophrenia, using the discrete event simulation method, was adapted to assess the cost and health impacts of adherence to the NICE recommendations. Three scenarios to improve adherence to the clinical guidelines were modelled: universal provision of cognitive-behavioural therapy for patients at clinical high risk of psychosis, universal provision of family intervention for patients with first-episode psychosis and prompt provision of clozapine for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The primary outcomes were lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years gained. RESULTS: The results suggest full adherence to the guideline recommendations would decrease cost and improve quality-adjusted life-years. Based on the NICE willingness-to-pay threshold of £20 000-£30 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, prompt provision of clozapine for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia results in the greatest net monetary benefit, followed by universal provision of cognitive-behavioural therapy for patients at clinical high risk of psychosis, and universal provision of family intervention for patients with first-episode psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that adherence to guideline recommendations would decrease cost and improve quality-adjusted life-years.

24497,Cost-Effectiveness of Tiotropium in Elderly Patients with Severe Asthma Using Real-World Data,"BACKGROUND: Tiotropium has the potential to alleviate asthmatic symptoms caused by the aging of lungs. However, few studies have focused on specific treatments for elderly patients with asthma. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding tiotropium to inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists in elderly patients with severe asthma using real-world data. METHODS: Phase I was a retrospective cohort study using the National Health Insurance claims data to measure clinical and economic outcomes. In phase II, a Markov model was constructed to evaluate cost-effectiveness from Korean health care system perspective, based on phase I, including 2 health states, and an asthma exacerbation event. We estimated cost given in 2018 US dollars, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Subgroup analyses for patients with poorly controlled symptoms (frequent short-acting beta-agonist users; frequent exacerbators) were performed. RESULTS: In elderly patients with severe asthma, the incremental cost and effectiveness in the tiotropium group compared with the inhaled corticosteroid and long-acting beta-agonist group were $2281 and 0.038 QALYs, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $60,074/QALY, indicating that the addition of tiotropium is not a cost-effective alternative. Meanwhile, 2 subgroups with poorly controlled symptoms showed that adding tiotropium is a cost-effective alternative (frequent short-acting beta-agonist users $4078/QALY; frequent exacerbators $8332/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Tiotropium shows a higher cost-effectiveness profile when applied to elderly patients with uncontrolled symptoms. These results using real-world evidence provide information beyond the clinical outcomes reported by randomized controlled trials, providing a complementary ground in establishing the reimbursement criteria of tiotropium for elderly patients with severe asthma.",2020-01-34385,33307277,J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,Sung-Hyun Hong,2020,/,,No,33307277,"Sung-Hyun Hong; Jeong-Yeon Cho; Tae-Bum Kim; Eui-Kyung Lee; Sun-Hong Kwon; Ju-Young Shin; Cost-Effectiveness of Tiotropium in Elderly Patients with Severe Asthma Using Real-World Data, J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract, 2020 Dec 8; ():2213-2201",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,tiotropium + inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta agonist vs. Standard/Usual Care- inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta agonist,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,60074,United States,2018,61917.08
24498,Cost-effectiveness of olaparib as a maintenance treatment for women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and BRCA1/2 mutations in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of olaparib monotherapy in the first-line maintenance setting vs. surveillance in women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and a BRCA1/2 mutation from a US third-party payer perspective. METHODS: A three-state (progression free, progressed disease, and death) partitioned survival model over a 50-year lifetime horizon was developed. Piecewise models were applied to data from the phase III trial SOLO1 to extrapolate survival outcomes. Health state utilities and adverse event disutilities were obtained from literature and SOLO1. Treatment costs, adverse event costs, and medical costs associated with health states were obtained from publicly available databases, SOLO1, and real-world data. Time on treatment was estimated using the data from SOLO1. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and life year (LY) gained were estimated. One-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, olaparib was associated with an additional 3.63 LYs and 2.93 QALYs, and an incremental total cost of $152,545 vs. surveillance. Incremental cost per LY gained and per QALY gained for olaparib were $42,032 and $51,986, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios remained below $100,000 across a range of inputs and scenarios. In the PSA, the probability of olaparib being cost-effective at a $100,000 per QALY threshold was 99%. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to surveillance, olaparib increases both the LYs and QALYs of women with newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer and with a germline or somatic BRCA mutation.

24499,Health and Economic Outcomes of Home Maintenance Allergen Immunotherapy in Select Patients with High Health Literacy during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis During Exceptional Times,"BACKGROUND: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is safe and effective but is typically administered under strict clinic observation to mitigate the risk of a systemic reaction to immunotherapy (SRIT). However, in the setting of the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, alternative care models should be explored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of home immunotherapy self-administration (HITSA) in a highly idealized circumstance for provision of maintenance AIT in a shelter-in-place or other scenarios of unforeseen reduction in nonessential medical services. METHODS: Markov modeling was used to compare in-office clinic AIT in selected patients using cohort analysis and microsimulation from the societal and health care perspectives. RESULTS: Assuming similar SRIT rates, HITSA was found to be a cost-effective option with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $44,554/quality-adjusted life-year when considering both incremental epinephrine autoinjector costs and coronavirus disease 2019 risks. Excluding epinephrine autoinjector costs, HISTA dominated other options. However, outside of pandemic considerations, HITSA was not cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $198,877,286) at annual epinephrine autoinjector costs above $287. As the incremental HITSA SRIT rate increased above 15%, clinic AIT was the most cost-effective strategy. Excluding both pandemic risks and risk of motor vehicle accident fatality from round-trip clinic transit, clinic AIT dominated other strategies. Clinic AIT was the more cost-effective option at very high fatality relative risk for HITSA or at very low annual risk of contracting coronavirus disease 2019.
