2001,Cost-effectiveness of bypass surgery versus stenting in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease,"PURPOSE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of surgical and angioplasty-based coronary artery revascularization techniques, in particular, angioplasty with primary stenting. METHODS: We used data from the Study of Economics and Quality of Life, a substudy of the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI), to measure the outcomes and costs of angioplasty and bypass surgery in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease who had not undergone prior coronary artery revascularization. Using a Markov decision model, we updated the outcomes and costs to reflect technology changes since the time of enrollment in BARI, and projected the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the two procedures from the time of initial treatment through death. We accounted for the effects of improved procedural safety and efficiency, and prolonged therapeutic effects of both surgery and stenting. This study was conducted from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Surgical revascularization was less costly and resulted in better outcomes than catheter-based intervention including stenting. It remained the preferred strategy after adjusting the stent outcomes to eliminate the costs and events associated with target lesion restenosis. Among angioplasty-based strategies, primary stent use cost an additional 189,000 US dollars per QALY gained compared with a strategy that reserved stent use for treatment of suboptimal balloon angioplasty results. CONCLUSION: Bypass surgery results in better outcomes than angioplasty in patients with multivessel disease, and at a lower cost.",2003-01-00565,14553874,Am J Med,Cynthia A Yock,2003,115 / 5,382-9,No,14553874,"Cynthia A Yock; Derek B Boothroyd; Douglas K Owens; Alan M Garber; Mark A Hlatky; Cost-effectiveness of bypass surgery versus stenting in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease, Am J Med, 2003-Oct-01; 115(5):0002-9343; 382-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (surgical-based coronary artery revascularization) vs. Angioplasty (angioplasty-based coronary artery revascularization),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2000,Not Stated
2002,Regional variation in the cost effectiveness of childhood hepatitis A immunization,"BACKGROUND: Routine childhood hepatitis A immunization is recommended in regions with incidence rates twice the national average, but it may be cost-effective in a wider geographic area. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the costs and benefits of potential hepatitis A immunization of healthy US children in regions with varying hepatitis A incidences. METHODS: We considered vaccination of the 2000 US birth cohort in states defined by historic hepatitis A incidence rates. Infections among potential vaccinees and their personal contacts were predicted from age 2 through 85 years. Net vaccination costs were estimated from health system and societal perspectives and were compared with life-years saved and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained using a 3% discount rate.RESULTS Nationally vaccination would prevent >75 000 cases of overt hepatitis A disease. Approximately two-thirds of health benefits would accrue to personal contacts rather than to vaccinees themselves. In states with incidence rates of > or =200%, 100 to 199%, 50 to 99% and <50% the national average, societal costs per QALY gained would be <0, <0, 13,800 and 63,000 US dollars, respectively. Nationally vaccination would cost 9100 US dollars per QALY gained from the perspective of the health system and 1400 US dollars per QALY gained from society""s perspective. Results are most sensitive to vaccination costs and rates of disease transmission through personal contact.

2007,Management of influenza symptoms in healthy adults,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic testing and empiric antiviral therapy for healthy adults with symptoms of influenza. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision model based on previously published data. Outcome measures included costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy. SETTING: Physician""s office. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetically healthy, working adults < 65 years of age presenting with cough and fever during the influenza season. INTERVENTIONS: Rapid testing or clinical diagnosis followed by treatment with amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir, or zanamivir compared with no antiviral therapy. RESULTS: Base-case analysis: not giving antiviral therapy is the most expensive and least effective strategy, costing 471 dollars per patient, mostly owing to time lost from work. Amantadine treatment increases life expectancy by 0.0014 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) while saving 108 dollars per patient relative to no antiviral therapy. Zanamivir is slightly more effective than amantadine, adding 0.0002 QALYs at an incremental cost of 31 dollars, or 133,000 dollars per QALY saved. All other strategies, including testing strategies, are both less effective and more expensive. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The model is sensitive to the probability of influenza infection, proportion of influenza caused by type B, the relative efficacy of the various drugs, and the value of a workday. At a clinical probability of influenza infection > 20%, antiviral therapy is favored. As the proportion of influenza B increases, zanamivir is favored over amantadine. Testing is rarely indicated. Ignoring the costs of lost workdays, amantadine treatment costs 1,200 dollars/QALY saved.

2009,Cost-effectiveness of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in middle ear or mastoid surgery,"OBJECTIVES: Despite the utility of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in reducing the risk of iatrogenic facial nerve injury during neurotologic surgery, its routine use during primary or revision surgery remains controversial. One of the major barriers to its acceptance is cost. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring during middle ear or mastoid surgery. RESEARCH DESIGN/METHODS: A simple decision analytic cost-effectiveness model and a societal approach were used to evaluate three cohorts of individuals who received (1) intraoperative facial nerve monitoring for both primary and revision middle ear or mastoid surgeries, or (2) facial nerve monitoring for revision surgeries only, or (3) no monitoring for any middle ear or mastoid surgeries. RESULTS: Our results strongly favored the use of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in all patients undergoing middle ear or mastoid surgery, adding about $222.73 to $528.00 US dollars to the total cost. The strategy to monitor primary and revision surgeries had the greatest effectiveness and lowest cost, with an average quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of 45.68 at an average cost of $238 US dollars. Facial nerve monitoring in revision patients only had similar QALYs (45.67) and higher costs ($292.1). Finally, the strategy not to monitor had the lowest QALY (45.65) and highest cost ($449.8).

2011,Clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery for morbid obesity: a systematic review and economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery for people with morbid obesity. DESIGN: A systematic review of randomised control trials (RCTs), prospective clinical trials and economic evaluations identified from 14 electronic databases (including Medline, Cochrane library and Embase from their inception to October 2001), bibliographies and consultation with experts and manufacturers was performed to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of different surgical procedures and nonsurgical management for morbid obesity. An economic evaluation was undertaken to assess cost effectiveness in the UK. SUBJECTS: People diagnosed as morbidly obese, defined as a body mass index (BMI) (weight in kilograms/height in metres(2)) >40 kg/m(2), or with a BMI>35 kg/m(2) with serious comorbid disease, in whom previous nonsurgical interventions had failed. MEASUREMENTS: The outcomes assessed included weight change, quality of life, peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality, revision rates and obesity comorbidities. Cost effectiveness was modelled from these data and presented as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Included studies differed in methodological quality. Surgery resulted in a significantly greater loss of weight (23-37 kg more weight) than nonsurgical treatment, which was maintained to 8 years and led to improvements in quality of life and comorbidities. The economic evaluation of surgery compared with nonsurgical management suggested that surgery was cost effective at pound 11000 per QALY.

2014,Clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery for morbid obesity: a systematic review and economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of surgery for people with morbid obesity. DESIGN: A systematic review of randomised control trials (RCTs), prospective clinical trials and economic evaluations identified from 14 electronic databases (including Medline, Cochrane library and Embase from their inception to October 2001), bibliographies and consultation with experts and manufacturers was performed to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of different surgical procedures and nonsurgical management for morbid obesity. An economic evaluation was undertaken to assess cost effectiveness in the UK. SUBJECTS: People diagnosed as morbidly obese, defined as a body mass index (BMI) (weight in kilograms/height in metres(2)) >40 kg/m(2), or with a BMI>35 kg/m(2) with serious comorbid disease, in whom previous nonsurgical interventions had failed. MEASUREMENTS: The outcomes assessed included weight change, quality of life, peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality, revision rates and obesity comorbidities. Cost effectiveness was modelled from these data and presented as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Included studies differed in methodological quality.

2024,Varicella vaccination in England and Wales: cost-utility analysis,"AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination, taking into account its impact on zoster. METHODS: An age structured transmission dynamic model was used to predict the future incidence of varicella and zoster. Data from national and sentinel surveillance systems were used to estimate age specific physician consultation, hospitalisation, and mortality rates. Unit costs, taken from standard sources, were applied to the predicted health outcomes. RESULTS: In England and Wales, the annual burden of VZV related disease is substantial, with an estimated 651 000 cases of varicella and 189 000 cases of zoster, resulting in approximately 18 000 QALYs lost. The model predicts that although the overall burden of varicella will significantly be reduced following mass infant vaccination, these benefits will be offset by a significant rise in zoster morbidity. Under base case assumptions, infant vaccination is estimated to produce an overall loss of 54 000 discounted QALYs over 80 years and to result in a net cost from the health provider (NHS) and the societal perspectives. These results rest heavily on the impact of vaccination on zoster. Adolescent vaccination is estimated to cost approximately 18 000 pounds sterling per QALY gained from the NHS perspective.

We developed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of two strategies to prevent PE in such patients: intra-vena-caval bird""s nest filter (BNF) with anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone. Using the benchmark of 50,000 US dollars per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), BNF was not cost-effective in this population as it reduced the rate of PE at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 198,852 dollars per QALY gained. However, after adjusting the model to reflect the 5-year mortality rate of hypothetical breast cancer patients, BNF was more effective and less expensive than anticoagulation alone.

2028,Management of influenza in adults older than 65 years of age: cost-effectiveness of rapid testing and antiviral therapy,"BACKGROUND: Although antiviral therapy is cost-effective in adults, its cost-effectiveness in older adults has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of influenza testing and treatment strategies for older adults. DESIGN: Cost-utility decision model. DATA SOURCES: Clinical trials of antiviral drugs and epidemiologic data. TARGET POPULATION: Noninstitutionalized adults older than 65 years of age with influenza-like illness. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Rapid diagnostic testing or empirical therapy with antiviral drugs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with no intervention, empirically treating an unvaccinated 75-year-old patient with amantadine increased life expectancy by 0.0014 QALY at a cost of 1.57 dollars, a cost-effectiveness ratio of 1129 dollars per QALY saved. Compared with amantadine, rapid diagnostic testing followed by treatment with oseltamivir cost 5025 dollars per QALY saved and empirical treatment with oseltamivir cost 10,296 dollars per QALY saved. Testing and treatment strategies were less cost-effective if the patient was vaccinated, ranging from 2483 dollars per QALY saved with amantadine to 70,300 dollars per QALY saved with oseltamivir. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The decision was sensitive to the probability of influenza, the efficacy of oseltamivir in preventing hospitalizations, and hospitalization and case-fatality rates. The decision was not sensitive to the probability or severity of medication side effects, the quality of life for influenza illness or hospitalization, the efficacy of antiviral therapy in shortening influenza illness, or the rapid diagnostic test characteristics.

2029,Management of influenza in adults older than 65 years of age: cost-effectiveness of rapid testing and antiviral therapy,"BACKGROUND: Although antiviral therapy is cost-effective in adults, its cost-effectiveness in older adults has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of influenza testing and treatment strategies for older adults. DESIGN: Cost-utility decision model. DATA SOURCES: Clinical trials of antiviral drugs and epidemiologic data. TARGET POPULATION: Noninstitutionalized adults older than 65 years of age with influenza-like illness. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Rapid diagnostic testing or empirical therapy with antiviral drugs. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Compared with no intervention, empirically treating an unvaccinated 75-year-old patient with amantadine increased life expectancy by 0.0014 QALY at a cost of 1.57 dollars, a cost-effectiveness ratio of 1129 dollars per QALY saved. Compared with amantadine, rapid diagnostic testing followed by treatment with oseltamivir cost 5025 dollars per QALY saved and empirical treatment with oseltamivir cost 10,296 dollars per QALY saved. Testing and treatment strategies were less cost-effective if the patient was vaccinated, ranging from 2483 dollars per QALY saved with amantadine to 70,300 dollars per QALY saved with oseltamivir.

2031,Cost-effectiveness of helicopter transport of stroke patients for thrombolysis,"OBJECTIVES: Treatment with intravenous (IV) or intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis in patients with acute ischemic stroke demands careful patient selection and specialized institutional capabilities. Physicians at hospitals without these resources may prefer patient transfer for acute treatment. Helicopter transport for these patients has been described but without analysis of the effects of its additional cost. The authors examined the cost-effectiveness of helicopter transport for patients with acute stroke. METHODS: Costs per additional good outcome and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were calculated using a computer model. Input variables included flight, thrombolytic agent, and angiography costs; annual cost per patient for long-term care of symptomatic stroke; percentage of transported patients treated; percentage of patients receiving IV versus IA therapy; discount rate; absolute probability of good outcome; annual mortality with and without treatment; and quality-of-life modifier. Sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: Helicopter transport of acute stroke patients to tertiary care centers for thrombolytic therapy costs $35,000 per additional good outcome and $3,700 per QALY for the reference case. Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the effectiveness of thrombolysis but minimally sensitive to most other input values. Cost per QALY ranged from $0 to $50,000, as the absolute increase in good outcomes (minimal or no deficit) ranged from 20% to 5%. Cost-effectiveness was not sensitive to ranges of helicopter flight costs or the proportion of flown patients undergoing treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This model indicates helicopter transfer of patients with suspected acute ischemic stroke for potential thrombolysis is cost-effective for a wide range of system variables.",2003-01-00597,12957981,Acad Emerg Med,Robert Silbergleit,2003,10 / 9,966-72,No,12957981,"Robert Silbergleit; Phillip A Scott; Mark J Lowell; Cost-effectiveness of helicopter transport of stroke patients for thrombolysis, Acad Emerg Med, 2003-Sep; 10(9):1069-6563; 966-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Helicopter transport to tertiary care center followed by treatment with intravenous (IV) thrombolysis or intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis vs. No helicopter transport with no thrombolysis,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,6100,United States,1998,9685.57
2032,Stroke: Effect of implementing an evaluation and treatment protocol compliant with NINDS recommendations,"PURPOSE: To evaluate--relative to routine clinical practice--the potential cost-effectiveness of implementing a strategy compliant with National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) recommendations for care of patients presenting with signs and symptoms of acute ischemic stroke. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A discrete-event simulation model of the process of stroke care from symptom onset through administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was constructed. A literature review was performed to determine process times, performance of computed tomography (CT), health outcomes, and cost estimates. The following were compared: (a) a ""base-case"" strategy determined on the basis of findings in the literature and (b) a NINDS-compliant strategy (ie, evaluation by emergency physician in less than 10 minutes, interpretation of CT scans within 45 minutes, and administration of tPA within 1 hour after presentation). Strategies were compared with regard to cost and effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all relevant cost, timing, and resource parameters. Outcomes of concern were quality-adjusted life years and number of patients treated within a 3-hour therapeutic window. RESULTS: The NINDS-compliant strategy resulted in an average quality-adjusted life years value of 3.64, versus 3.63 for the base case, at an approximate cost of 434 US dollars per patient. The NINDS-compliant strategy increased the proportion of treatable patients from 1.4% to 3.7% and remained cost-effective for expenditures of up to 450 US dollars per patient. Assuming base-case parameters are used, increasing the number of CT scanners from two to eight raised the proportion of treatable patients to 1.5%. Increasing the number of available neurologists from four to eight raised the proportion to 1.44%. Reducing the time from stroke onset to emergency department arrival by 30 minutes raised the proportion to up to 7.7%. CONCLUSION: Applying NINDS recommendations is potentially cost-effective, although reducing the time from stroke onset to emergency department arrival may be even more so.",2003-01-00598,12954888,Radiology,James E Stahl,2003,228 / 3,659-68,No,12954888,"James E Stahl; Karen L Furie; Suzanne Gleason; G Scott Gazelle; Stroke: Effect of implementing an evaluation and treatment protocol compliant with NINDS recommendations, Radiology, 2003-Sep; 228(3):0033-8419; 659-68",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)-compliant strategy for target population vs. Standard care,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-43400,United States,2000,-65228.79
2033,"Cost effectiveness of diagnostic strategies for patients with acute, undifferentiated chest pain","OBJECTIVES: Patients presenting to hospital with acute, undifferentiated chest pain have a low, but important, risk of significant myocardial ischaemia. Potential diagnostic strategies for patients with acute, undifferentiated chest pain vary from low cost, poor effectiveness (discharging all home) to high cost, high effectiveness (admission and intensive investigation). This paper aimed to estimate the relative cost effectiveness of these strategies. METHODS: Decision analysis modelling was used to measure the incremental cost per quality adjusted year of life (QALY) gained for five potential strategies to diagnose acute undifferentiated chest pain, compared with the next most effective strategy, or a baseline strategy of discharging all patients home without further testing. RESULTS: Cardiac enzyme testing alone costs pound 17 432/QALY compared with discharge without testing. Adding two to six hours of observation and repeat enzyme testing costs an additional pound 18 567/QALY. Adding exercise testing to this strategy costs pound 28 553/QALY. A strategy of overnight admission, enzyme, and exercise testing has an incremental cost of pound 120 369/QALY, while a strategy consisting of overnight admission without exercise testing is subject to extended dominance. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the results are sensitive to variations in the direct costs of running each strategy and to variation in assumptions regarding the effect of diagnostic testing upon quality of life of those with non-cardiac disease.

2039,Cost-effectiveness of automated external defibrillator deployment in selected public locations,"OBJECTIVE: The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends an automated external defibrillator (AED) be considered for a specific location if there is at least a 20% annual probability the device will be used. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the AHA recommendation and of AED deployment in selected public locations with known cardiac arrest rates. DESIGN: Markov Decision Model employing a societal perspective. SETTING: Selected public locations in the United States. PATIENTS: A simulated cohort of the American public. INTERVENTION: Strategy 1: individuals experiencing cardiac arrest were treated by emergency medical services equipped with AEDs (EMS-D). Strategy 2: individuals were treated with AEDs deployed as part of a public access defibrillation program. Strategies differed only in the initial availability of an AED and its impact on cardiac arrest survival. RESULTS: Under the base-case assumption that a deployed AED will be used on 1 cardiac arrest every 5 years (20% annual probability of AED use), the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained is $30,000 for AED deployment compared with EMS-D care. AED deployment costs less than $50,000 per QALY gained provided that the annual probability of AED use is 12% or greater. Monte Carlo simulation conducted while holding the annual probability of AED use at 20% demonstrated that 87% of the trials had a cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $50,000 per QALY.

METHODS: After the control of index bleeding with endotherapy and drugs, three strategies were evaluated: empirical treatment for possible H. pylori infection followed by a PPI for 2 months; test for H. pylori, eradication if positive, maintenance PPI if negative; maintenance PPI alone. Probability and direct cost data were obtained from a Medline search and Indian hospitals, respectively. Cost-minimisation, cost-utility, one- and two-way sensitivity analyses and threshold values were evaluated.

2042,Cost-utility analysis comparing free and pedicled TRAM flap for breast reconstruction,"The purpose of this study was to compare the free TRAM to the unipedicled TRAM flap in postmastectomy reconstruction, using a cost-utility analysis. A decision analytic model was used for this study. Medical costs associated with the two techniques were estimated from the Ontario Ministry of Health Schedule of Benefits (1998). Hospital costs were obtained from St. Joseph""s Healthcare, a university hospital in Hamilton, Ontario. Utilities were obtained from 33 ""experts"" across Canada and then converted into quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The probabilities of various health states associated with unipedicled and free TRAM flaps were obtained by reviewing several key articles. The free TRAM flap was more costly than the unipedicled TRAM flap, but it provided more QALYs. The baseline incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was $5,113.73/QALY, favoring adoption of the free TRAM flap. This study showed that the free TRAM flap is a cost-effective procedure for postmastectomy reconstruction in the Canadian healthcare system.",2003-01-00607,12942517,Microsurgery,Achilleas Thoma,2003,23 / 4,287-95,No,12942517,"Achilleas Thoma; Dana Khuthaila; Gloria Rockwell; Karen Veltri; Cost-utility analysis comparing free and pedicled TRAM flap for breast reconstruction, Microsurgery, 2003; 23(4):0738-1085; 287-95",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Use of free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap vs. Use of unipedicled TRAM flap,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,5113.73,Canada,2001,4826.74
2043,Within-trial cost-effectiveness of lifestyle intervention or metformin for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that intensive lifestyle and metformin interventions reduced the incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with a placebo intervention. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the lifestyle and metformin interventions relative to the placebo intervention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Analyses were performed from a health system perspective that considered direct medical costs only and a societal perspective that considered direct medical costs, direct nonmedical costs, and indirect costs. Analyses were performed with the interventions as implemented in the DPP and as they might be implemented in clinical practice. RESULTS: The lifestyle and metformin interventions required more resources than the placebo intervention from a health system perspective, and over 3 years they cost approximately US dollars 2250 more per participant. As implemented in the DPP and from a societal perspective, the lifestyle and metformin interventions cost US dollars 24400 and US dollars 34500, respectively, per case of diabetes delayed or prevented and US dollars 51600 and US dollars 99200 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained.

2045,Percutaneous stenting of incidental unilateral renal artery stenosis: decision analysis of costs and benefits,"PURPOSE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of prophylactic percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stent placement (PTA-S) in patients with incidentally discovered, asymptomatic renal artery stenosis (RAS) compared to delaying PTA-S until patients develop refractory hypertension or renal insufficiency (therapeutic PTA-S). METHODS: The Markov decision analysis model was used to determine the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved for prophylactic PTA-S as compared to therapeutic PTA-S in a hypothetical cohort of patients with 50% unilateral atherosclerotic RAS followed from age 61 to death. RESULTS: Prophylactic PTA-S compared to therapeutic PTA-S results in more QALYs/patient (10.9 versus 10.3) at higher lifetime costs ($23,664 versus $16,558). The incremental cost effectiveness of prophylactic PTA-S was estimated to be $12,466/QALY. Prophylactic stenting was not cost effective (>$50,000/QALY) if the modeled incidence of stent restenosis exceeded 15%/year and the incidence of progression in the contralateral renal artery was <2% of arteries/year. CONCLUSIONS: PTA-S of incidental, asymptomatic unilateral RAS may improve patients"" quality of life at an acceptable incremental cost.

2046,Preventing HIV in injection drug users: choosing the best mix of interventions for the population,"Injection drug users (IDUs) transmit the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) via both needle sharing and sex. This analysis explores the effects of population risk behaviors, intervention effectiveness, intervention costs, and budget and capacity constraints when allocating funds between two prevention programs to maximize effectiveness. The two interventions, methadone maintenance and street outreach, address different types of risk behavior. We developed a model of the spread of HIV and divided IDUs into susceptible (uninfected) persons and infective persons and separately portrayed sex and injection risk. We simulated the epidemic in San Francisco, California, and New York City for periods from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s and incorporated the behavioral effects of the two interventions. We used the simulation to find the allocation of a fixed budget to the two interventions that averted the greatest number of infections in the IDUs and their noninjecting sex partners. We assumed that interventions have increasing marginal costs. In the epidemic scenarios, our analysis found that the best allocation nearly always involves spending as much as possible on street outreach. This result is largely insensitive to variations in epidemic scenario, intervention efficacy, and cost. However, the absolute and relative benefits of the best allocation varied. In mid-1990s San Francisco, maximizing spending on outreach averted 3.5% of total HIV infections expected and 10 times the 0.3% from maximizing spending on treatment. In late 1980s New York City, the difference is five-fold (2.6% vs. 0.44%, respectively). Our analyses suggest that, even though prevention works better in higher risk scenarios, the choice of intervention mix is more important in the lower risk scenarios.

DESIGN: Markov decision analysis model comparing treatment and non-treatment of hypertension. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts for 20 different strata of sex, age (30-79 years, in 10-year age bands), and cardiovascular risk (low and high risk). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Life expectancy, and incremental cost : effectiveness ratios for treatment and non-treatment strategies. RESULTS: In terms of life expectancy, blood pressure treatment increased life expectancy in all age, sex, and risk strata, by between 1.6 and 10.3%, compared with a policy of non-treatment. In terms of cost-effectiveness, treatment was more effective, but also cost more than non-treatment for all age, sex, and risk strata except the oldest high-risk men and women. Incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) among low-risk groups ranged from pound 1030 to pound 3304. Cost-effectiveness results for low-risk individuals were sensitive to the utility of receiving antihypertensive treatment. Treatment of high-risk individuals was highly cost-effective, such that it was the dominant strategy in the oldest age group, and resulted in incremental costs per QALY ranging from pound 34 to pound 265 in younger age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Policy decisions about which patients to treat depend on whether a life-expectancy or cost-effectiveness perspective is taken.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of imatinib (600 mg daily) when used for the treatment of patients in advanced stages of CML (accelerated phase and blast crisis) against conventional therapies of combination chemotherapy (DAT) and palliative care in hospital or at home. A Markov model simulated the transitions of hypothetical patient cohorts and outcomes were modelled for 5 years from the start of treatment. Costs were estimated from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Over 5 years, a patient in accelerated phase will, on average, accrue an additional 2.09 QALYs with imatinib compared to conventional therapies, while patients in blast crisis will accrue an additional 0.58 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with imatinib compared to conventional therapies. The costs per additional QALY gained from treatment with imatinib compared with conventional therapies were pound 29344 (accelerated phase) and pound 42239 (blast crisis).

The costs per additional QALY gained from treatment with imatinib compared with conventional therapies were pound 29344 (accelerated phase) and pound 42239 (blast crisis). The results were particularly sensitive to the price of imatinib, improvements in quality of life, and the duration of haematological responses.

2055,The quality of life and cost utility of home nocturnal and conventional in-center hemodialysis,"BACKGROUND: Home nocturnal hemodialysis is an intensive form of hemodialysis, where patients perform their treatments at home for about 7 hours approximately 6 nights a week. Compared with in-center conventional hemodialysis, home nocturnal hemodialysis has been shown to improve physiologic parameters and reduce health care costs; however, the effects on quality of life and cost utility are less clear. We hypothesized that individuals performing home nocturnal hemodialysis would have a higher quality of life and superior cost utility than in-center hemodialysis patients. METHODS: Home nocturnal hemodialysis patients and a demographically similar group of in-center hemodialysis patients from a hospital without a home hemodialysis program underwent computer-assisted interviews to assess their utility score for current health by the standard gamble method. RESULTS: Nineteen in-center hemodialysis and 24 home nocturnal hemodialysis patients were interviewed. Mean annual costs for home nocturnal hemodialysis were about 10,000 dollars lower for home nocturnal hemodialysis (55,139 dollars +/- 7651 dollars for home nocturnal hemodialysis vs. 66,367 dollars +/- 17,502 dollars for in-center hemodialysis, P = 0.03). Home nocturnal hemodialysis was associated with a higher utility score than in-center hemodialysis (0.77 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.53 +/- 0.35, P = 0.03). The cost utility for home nocturnal hemodialysis was 71,443 dollars/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), while for in-center hemodialysis it was 125,845 dollars/QALY. Home nocturnal hemodialysis was the dominant strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of -45,932 dollars. The 95% CI for the ICER, and 2500 bootstrap iterations of the ICER all fell below the cost-effectiveness ceiling of 50,000 dollars. The net monetary benefit of home nocturnal hemodialysis ranged from 11,227 dollars to 35,669 dollars. CONCLUSION: Home nocturnal hemodialysis is associated with a higher quality of life and a superior cost utility when compared to in-center hemodialysis.",2003-01-00618,12911550,Kidney Int,Philip A McFarlane,2003,64 / 3,1004-11,No,12911550,"Philip A McFarlane; Ahmed M Bayoumi; Andreas Pierratos; Donald A Redelmeier; The quality of life and cost utility of home nocturnal and conventional in-center hemodialysis, Kidney Int, 2003-Sep; 64(3):0085-2538; 1004-11",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensive home nocturnal hemodialysis for about 7 hours approximately 6 nights a week vs. In-center conventional hemodialysis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,14 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-45828.57,Canada,2001,-43256.65
2056,Cost effectiveness of defibrillation by targeted responders in public settings,"BACKGROUND: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is frequent and has poor outcomes. Defibrillation by trained targeted nontraditional responders improves survival versus historical controls, but it is unclear whether such defibrillation is a good value for the money. Therefore, this study estimated the incremental cost effectiveness of defibrillation by targeted nontraditional responders in public settings by using decision analysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A Markov model evaluated the potential cost effectiveness of standard emergency medical services (EMS) versus targeted nontraditional responders. Standard EMS included first-responder defibrillation followed by advanced life support. Targeted nontraditional responders included standard EMS supplemented by defibrillation by trained lay responders. The analysis adopted a US societal perspective. Input data were derived from published or publicly available data. Future costs and effects were discounted at 3%. Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of results. Standard EMS had a median of 0.47 (interquartile range [IQR]=0.32 to 0.69) quality-adjusted life years and a median of 14 100 dollars (IQR=8600 dollars to 21 900 dollars) costs per arrest. Targeted nontraditional responders in casinos had an incremental cost of a median 56 700 dollars (IQR=44 100 dollars to 77 200 dollars) per additional quality-adjusted life year. The results were sensitive to changes in time to defibrillation, incidence of arrest, and number of devices required to implement rapid defibrillation. CONCLUSIONS: Where cardiac arrest is frequent and response time intervals are short, rapid defibrillation by targeted nontraditional responders may be a good value for the money compared with standard EMS.

2057,Cost-effectiveness of ultrasound in preventing femoral venous catheter-associated pulmonary embolism,"Femoral central venous catheter use is complicated by a high risk of deep venous thrombosis despite antithrombotic prophylaxis. Although some have recommended screening for femoral catheter-associated thrombosis to prevent pulmonary embolism (PE), this strategy""s economic implications are unclear. Therefore, we used a decision model to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of a Doppler ultrasound-based screening strategy versus no ultrasound in averting thromboembolic complications associated with femoral catheters. The base-case analysis included a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old medical patients treated for acute respiratory failure. The perspective was that of the health care payor, and the primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life expectancy, PE, and PE-associated deaths. The ultrasound strategy cost $8,688/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, $5,305/PE averted, and $99,286/PE death averted. The best- and worst-case scenarios, calculated in multiway sensitivity analyses by varying in-hospital mortality, deep venous thrombosis prevalence, and ultrasound accuracy, ranged from $1,170/QALY to $35,342/QALY, respectively. Probablistic analyses, in which variables with uncertain values were varied randomly within their ranges, demonstrated median costs of $12,793/QALY (interquartile range $8,176/QALY, $20,648/QALY).

2058,"Assessment of health economics in Alzheimer""s disease (AHEAD): treatment with galantamine in the UK","OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term health and economic impact of treating mild to moderate Alzheimer""s disease (AD) with galantamine (16 mg or 24 mg per day) compared to no cholinesterase therapy in the UK. METHODS: The long-term costs and outcomes were assessed using a model developed from longitudinal data on a cohort of AD patients. The model predicts the time until patients require full-time care, defined as the consistent requirement for a significant amount of care and supervision each day. Efficacy data were obtained from three clinical trials comparing galantamine with placebo, forecasts were made for ten years. Costs were determined in 2001 British pounds and discounted at 6% per annum, while outcomes such as time to full-time care were discounted at 1.5%. RESULTS: Without pharmacological treatment, patients are expected to incur costs of 28,134 British pounds over ten years, 70% of costs accrue from providing full-time care. Galantamine (16 mg per day) is predicted to reduce the duration of the full-time care state by 12%; approximately five patients need to be treated to avoid one year of full-time care. The ten-year incremental costs per month of full-time care avoided average pound 192 British pounds per patient and 8,693 British pounds per QALY. Savings (1380 British pounds) are predicted for patients who continue treatment beyond six months and whose cognitive function is maintained or improved. Comparable results were estimated for the 24 mg dose. CONCLUSION: In addition to the clinical benefits associated with galantamine treatment, the savings predicted from delaying when full-time care is needed may offset the treatment costs.",2003-01-00632,12891643,Int J Geriatr Psychiatry,Alexandra Ward,2003,18 / 8,740-7,No,12891643,"Alexandra Ward; J Jaime Caro; Denis Getsios; K Ishak; J O'Brien; R Bullock; Assessment of health economics in Alzheimer""s disease (AHEAD): treatment with galantamine in the UK, Int J Geriatr Psychiatry, 2003-Aug; 18(8):0885-6230; 740-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with galantamine at 16 mg per day vs. No pharmacological treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,6.00,1.50,8693,United Kingdom,2001,18289.01
2059,Utility-adjusted analysis of the cost of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases,"Palliative radiotherapy is effective in the treatment of bone metastases but is under-utilized, possibly because it is perceived to be expensive. We performed a cost-utility analysis of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases, evaluating both the actual cost of radiotherapy as well as its impact on quality of life by adjusting for the variation in response to treatment. Hospital records between July 1991 and July 1996 were reviewed to ascertain the number of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases, the average number of fields of radiation delivered to each patient and the average duration of survival. Partial and complete response rates to palliative radiotherapy were obtained from a review of all published randomized controlled trials of radiation treatment of bone metastases. Utility values were assigned to the response rates, and an overall adjusted response rate to radiotherapy was derived. The cost of delivering a field of radiation was calculated. The total cost was divided by the total number of response months to give a utility-adjusted cost per month of palliative radiotherapy. The utility-adjusted cost per month of palliative radiotherapy of bone metastases was found to be AUS dollars 100 per month or AUS dollars 1200 per utility-adjusted life-year. This study demonstrates that, contrary to popular perception, palliative radiotherapy is a cost-effective treatment modality for bone metastases.",2003-01-00634,12890248,Australas Radiol,Michael B Barton,2003,47 / 3,274-8,No,12890248,"Michael B Barton; Susannah A Jacob; Val Gebsky; Utility-adjusted analysis of the cost of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases, Australas Radiol, 2003-Sep; 47(3):0004-8461; 274-8",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases vs. *No comparator explicitly stated (no palliative treatment?),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,1200,Australia,1996,1549.57

2063,The impact of including passive benefits in cost-effectiveness analysis: the case of automated external defibrillators on commercial aircraft,"OBJECTIVE: Traditional cost-utility analysis assumes that all benefits from health-related interventions are captured by the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained by the few individuals whose outcome is improved by the intervention. However, it is possible that many individuals who do not directly benefit from an intervention receive utility, and therefore QALYs, because of the passive benefit (aka sense of security) provided by the existence of the intervention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact that varying quantities of passive benefit have on the cost-effectiveness of airline defibrillator programs. METHODS: A decision analytic model with Markov processes was constructed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of defibrillator deployment on domestic commercial passenger aircraft over 1 year. Airline passengers were assigned small incremental utility gains (.001-.01) during an estimated 3-hour flight to evaluate the impact of passive benefit on overall cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: In the base case analysis with no allowance for passive benefit, the cost-effectiveness of airline automated external defibrillator deployment was US dollars 34000 per QALY gained. If 1% of all passengers received utility gain of.01, the cost-effectiveness declined to US dollars 30000. Cost-effectiveness was enhanced when the quantity of passive benefit was raised or the percentage of individuals receiving passive benefit increased. CONCLUSIONS: Automated external defibrillator deployment on passenger aircraft is likely to be cost-effective. If a small percentage of airline passengers receive incremental utility gains from passive benefit of automated external defibrillator availability, the impact on overall cost-effectiveness may be substantial.

However, little is known about the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of various strategies for managing pharyngitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) in U.S. adults. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of several diagnostic and management strategies for patients with suspected GAS pharyngitis. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published literature, including systematic reviews where possible. When costs were not available in the literature, we estimated them from our institution and Medicare charges. TARGET POPULATION: Adults in the general U.S. population. TIME HORIZON: 1 year. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Five strategies for the management of adult patients with pharyngitis: 1) observation without testing or treatment, 2) empirical treatment with penicillin, 3) throat culture using a two-plate selective culture technique, 4) optical immunoassay (OIA) followed by culture to confirm negative OIA test results, or 5) OIA alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per lost quality-adjusted life-days (converted to life-years where appropriate) and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Empirical treatment was the least effective strategy at a GAS pharyngitis prevalence of 10% (resulting in 0.41 lost quality-adjusted life-day). Although the other four strategies had similar effectiveness (all resulted in about 0.27 lost quality-adjusted life-day), culture was the least expensive strategy. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Results were sensitive to the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis: OIA followed by culture was most effective when GAS pharyngitis prevalence was greater than 20%. Observation was least expensive when prevalence was less than 6%, and empirical treatment was least expensive when prevalence was greater than 71%. The effectiveness of strategies was also very sensitive to the probability of anaphylaxis: When the probability of anaphylaxis was about half the baseline probability, OIA/culture was most effective; when the probability was 1.6 times that of baseline, observation was most effective.

2067,Diagnosis and management of adults with pharyngitis. A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatic fever has become uncommon in the United States while rapid diagnostic test technology for streptococcal antigens has improved. However, little is known about the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of various strategies for managing pharyngitis caused by group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GAS) in U.S. adults. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of several diagnostic and management strategies for patients with suspected GAS pharyngitis. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published literature, including systematic reviews where possible. When costs were not available in the literature, we estimated them from our institution and Medicare charges. TARGET POPULATION: Adults in the general U.S. population. TIME HORIZON: 1 year. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: Five strategies for the management of adult patients with pharyngitis: 1) observation without testing or treatment, 2) empirical treatment with penicillin, 3) throat culture using a two-plate selective culture technique, 4) optical immunoassay (OIA) followed by culture to confirm negative OIA test results, or 5) OIA alone. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per lost quality-adjusted life-days (converted to life-years where appropriate) and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Empirical treatment was the least effective strategy at a GAS pharyngitis prevalence of 10% (resulting in 0.41 lost quality-adjusted life-day). Although the other four strategies had similar effectiveness (all resulted in about 0.27 lost quality-adjusted life-day), culture was the least expensive strategy. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: Results were sensitive to the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis: OIA followed by culture was most effective when GAS pharyngitis prevalence was greater than 20%. Observation was least expensive when prevalence was less than 6%, and empirical treatment was least expensive when prevalence was greater than 71%. The effectiveness of strategies was also very sensitive to the probability of anaphylaxis: When the probability of anaphylaxis was about half the baseline probability, OIA/culture was most effective; when the probability was 1.6 times that of baseline, observation was most effective. Only at an OIA cost less than half of baseline did the OIA alone strategy become less expensive than culture. Results were not sensitive to other variations in probabilities or costs of diagnosis or treatment of GAS pharyngitis. CONCLUSIONS: Observation, culture, and two rapid antigen test strategies for diagnostic testing and treatment of suspected GAS pharyngitis in adults have very similar effectiveness and costs, although culture is the least expensive and most effective strategy when the GAS pharyngitis prevalence is 10%.

2068,Cost-effectiveness of treatment for chronic hepatitis C infection in an evolving patient population,"CONTEXT: Approximately 2.7 million US individuals are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV). As public health campaigns are pursued, a growing number of treatment candidates are likely to have minimal evidence of liver damage. OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of newer treatments for chronic hepatitis C infection in a population of asymptomatic, HCV sero-positive but otherwise healthy individuals. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model of the natural history of HCV infection and impact of treatment. We used an epidemiologic model to derive a range of natural history parameters that were empirically calibrated to provide a good fit to observed data on both prevalence of HCV seropositivity and time trends in outcomes related to HCV infection. PATIENTS: Cohorts of 40-year-old men and women with elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase, positive results on quantitative HCV RNA assays and serologic tests for antibody to HCV, and no histological evidence of fibrosis on liver biopsy. INTERVENTIONS: Monotherapy with standard or pegylated interferon alfa-2b; combination therapy with standard or pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime costs, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The probability of patients with chronic HCV developing cirrhosis over a 30-year period ranged from 13% to 46% for men and from 1% to 29% for women. The incremental cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with pegylated interferon for men ranged from 26 000 dollars to 64 000 dollars per QALY for genotype 1 and from 10 000 dollars to 28 000 dollars per QALY for other genotypes; and for women ranged from 32 000 dollars to 90 000 dollars for genotype 1 and from 12 000 dollars to 42 000 dollars for other genotypes. Because the benefits of treatment were realized largely in the form of improvements in health-related quality of life, rather than prolonged survivorship, cost-effectiveness ratios expressed as dollars per year of life were substantially higher. Results were most sensitive to assumptions about the gains and decrements in health-related quality of life associated with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: While newer treatment options for hepatitis C appear to be reasonably cost-effective on average, these results vary widely across different patient subgroups and depend critically on quality-of-life assumptions.

2077,An operating cost comparison between conventional and home quotidian hemodialysis,"BACKGROUND: Although several studies have shown that simulated annual direct health care costs are substantially lower for patients undergoing more frequent hemodialysis (HD), there is limited information about the economics of daily HD and nocturnal HD. METHODS: The London Daily/Nocturnal Hemodialysis Study compared the economics of short daily HD (n = 10), long nocturnal HD (n = 12), and conventional thrice-weekly HD (n = 22) in patients over 18 months. A retrospective analysis of patients"" conventional HD costs during the 12 months before study entry was conducted to measure the change in cost after switching to quotidian HD. RESULTS: As the data show, annual costs (in Canadian dollars) for daily HD are substantially lower than for both nocturnal HD and conventional HD: approximately 67,300 Can dollars, 74,400 Can dollars, and 72,700 Can dollars per patient, respectively. Moreover, marginal changes in operating cost per patient year were - 9,800 Can dollars, -17,400 Can dollars, and +3,100 Can dollars for the daily HD, nocturnal HD, and conventional HD groups. Because of the increase in number of treatments, treatment supply costs per patient for the daily HD and nocturnal HD study groups were approximately twice those for conventional HD patients. However, average costs for consults, hospitalization days, emergency room visits, and laboratory tests for quotidian HD patients tended to decline after study entry. The major cost saving in home quotidian HD derived from the reduction in direct nursing time, excluding patient training. Total annualized cost per quality-adjusted life-year for the daily HD and nocturnal HD groups were 85,442 Can dollars and 120,903 Can dollars, which represented a marginal change of - 15,090 Can dollars and - 21,651 Can dollars, respectively, reflecting both improved quality of life and reduced costs for quotidian HD patients.

2078,Economic modelling of different treatment strategies for haemophilia A with high-responding inhibitors,"This paper reports a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of treatment options in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors. As very little relevant published evidence was identified, an economic modelling exercise was undertaken to calculate the cost-effectiveness of different strategies in the treatment of high-responding haemophilia A patients with inhibitors. A decision analysis approach was used to model the expected lifetime clinical outcomes and costs of the more common regimens currently used in UK in treating severe haemophiliacs with inhibitors. The model attempts to reflect the outcomes of clinical events, costs and life expectancy for each different treatment regimen for haemophilic boys with inhibitors who are high responders (defined as inhibitor level >/=10 BU) throughout their life. The basic model structure is centred on a Markov decision process, which was used to simulate, at quarter-yearly intervals, the movement through discrete health states and their complications. The model allows a comparison of cost-effectiveness between three immune tolerance induction (ITI) regimens (Bonn, Mälmo and Low-Dose protocols) and against a relevant ""on-demand"" (OD) regimen. It also shows the cost-effectiveness of different OD regimens using different bypassing agents. The results of the economic modelling indicate that treating haemophilia A patients who have high-responding inhibitors OD with recombinant activated factor VII is cost-effective compared to treatment with activated prothrombin complex concentrates. However, when OD treatment regimens are compared with the three ITI protocols, the Malmö ITI protocol is the preferred treatment strategy, generating more quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and less cost than either an OD regimen or the Bonn or Low-Dose ITI protocols.",2003-01-00660,12828681,Haemophilia,C Knight,2003,9 / 4,521-40,No,12828681,"C Knight; S Paisley; Jeremy Wight; M L Jones; Economic modelling of different treatment strategies for haemophilia A with high-responding inhibitors, Haemophilia, 2003-Jul; 9(4):1351-8216; 521-40",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bonn (High-Dose) immune tolerance induction (ITI) protocol with recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) to eradicate inhibitors plus FVIII to control bleeds vs. 'On-demand' management of bleeds with activated prothrombin complex concentrates (APCC) and porcine factor VIII (pVIII) as alternative haemostatic agents,Not Stated,Not Stated,2 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,6.00,1.50,147785,United Kingdom,2000,336632.47

The model attempts to reflect the outcomes of clinical events, costs and life expectancy for each different treatment regimen for haemophilic boys with inhibitors who are high responders (defined as inhibitor level >/=10 BU) throughout their life. The basic model structure is centred on a Markov decision process, which was used to simulate, at quarter-yearly intervals, the movement through discrete health states and their complications. The model allows a comparison of cost-effectiveness between three immune tolerance induction (ITI) regimens (Bonn, Mälmo and Low-Dose protocols) and against a relevant ""on-demand"" (OD) regimen.

2084,CME review: A cost-utility analysis of laser photocoagulation for extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization,"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to perform a reference case (average case), cost-utility analysis of laser photocoagulation for extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization associated with age-related macular degeneration using a model incorporating patient preferences. METHODS: Visual acuity data for patients treated and observed over a 5-year period were obtained from previously reported studies by the Macular Photocoagulation Study Group. The results from this prospective, randomized trial were incorporated in a cost-utility model using time-trade-off utility analysis and decision analysis with Markov modeling according to the recommendations of the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. Expenditures and health care benefits were each discounted at a 3% yearly rate. RESULTS: Laser photocoagulation therapy for extrafoveal choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration, compared with observation, resulted in a mean gain of 0.0740 quality-adjusted life-year per patient treated. The mean cost of treatment for the average patient totaled 1,715 US dollars. The cost divided by the health care benefit resulted in 23,176 year 2001 US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained for this procedure for a reference case. Sensitivity analyses, varying the cost, utility values, and discount parameters, resulted in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year gained ranging from 16,117 to 49,766 US dollars.

2085,Cost-effectiveness of a primary care depression intervention,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of a quality improvement depression intervention (enhanced care) in primary care settings relative to usual care. DESIGN: Following stratification, we randomized 12 primary care practices to enhanced or usual care conditions and followed patients for 12 months. SETTING: Primary care practices located in 10 states across the United States. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eleven patients beginning a new treatment episode for major depression. INTERVENTIONS: Training the primary care team to assess, educate, and monitor depressed patients during the acute and continuation stages of their depression treatment episode over 1 year. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness was measured by calculating incremental (enhanced minus usual care) costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from SF-36 data. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in the main analysis was US dollars 15463 per QALY. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the sensitivity analyses ranged from US dollars 11341 (using geographic block variables to control for pre-intervention service utilization) to US dollars 19976 (increasing the cost estimates by 50%) per QALY.

2086,The cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion compared with multiple daily injections for the management of diabetes,"AIMS: To estimate the cost effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) for patients using insulin pumps. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to estimate the costs and outcomes for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) treated with CSII using an insulin pump compared with MDI. Key parameters were obtained from the published scientific literature. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken for 10 000 hypothetical patients over 8 years of monthly cycles (the expected life of a pump). RESULTS: Over an 8-year period an average patient could expect to gain 0.48 [standard deviation (sd) 0.20] QALYs using CSII compared with MDI. The additional cost over 8 years for this gain was pounds 5462 (sd pounds 897). The incremental cost per QALY was pounds 11,461 (sd pounds 3656). CSII was most cost-effective in patients who had more than two severe hypoglycaemic events per year and who required admission to hospital at least once every year. Cases where CSII might be not economically viable are cases where diabetes is well controlled with few severe hypoglycaemic events. Results were most sensitive to the number of hypoglycaemic events per patient and the utility weights used to estimate QALYs. CONCLUSION: CSII is a worthwhile investment when targeted to those who might benefit most.",2003-01-00666,12823242,Diabet Med,Paul Scuffham,2003,20 / 7,586-93,No,12823242,"Paul Scuffham; L Carr; The cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion compared with multiple daily injections for the management of diabetes, Diabet Med, 2003-Jul; 20(7):0742-3071; 586-93",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using an insulin pump vs. Multiple daily injections,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,8 Years,6.00,1.50,11461,United Kingdom,2001,24112.54
2087,Cost-utility analysis of vagus nerve stimulators for adults with medically refractory epilepsy,"INTRODUCTION: The cost-utility of vagus nerve stimulator (VNS) devices for medically refractory epilepsy has yet to be estimated. METHODS: Using a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of VNS, we estimate that six people require implantation in order for one person to experience a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. Costs averted from improved epilepsy control were ascertained from published literature. Values for health states were obtained from a series of 42 seizure clinic attenders using time trade-off techniques and the EQ-5D health status instrument. The cost per quality adjusted life year gained was estimated and the values obtained were tested in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Improved epilepsy control averted, on average, 745 pounds sterling health care costs per annum. People with epilepsy had great difficulty performing the time trade-off experiment, but those who managed to complete the task valued a 50% reduction in their own seizure frequency at 0.285 units. For a programme of six implants, the baseline model estimated the cost per quality adjusted life year gained at 28,849 pounds sterling. The most favourable estimate was equal to 4785 pounds sterling per quality adjusted life year gained, assuming that the number needed to treat was similar to published series in which one response was obtained for every three implants. The least favourable estimate was equal to 63,000 pounds sterling per quality adjusted life year gained, when EQ-5D utility values were used. The cost per quality adjusted life year gained was not sensitive to changes in length of stay, nor complication rates, but was significantly influenced by cost of device and device battery life expectancy. CONCLUSION: There is not a strong economic argument against a programme of VNS implantation, although care should be taken to try and identify and treat those most likely to benefit.",2003-01-00670,12810336,Seizure,Raeburn B Forbes,2003,12 / 5,249-56,No,12810336,"Raeburn B Forbes; Shirley Macdonald; Sam Eljamel; Richard C Roberts; Cost-utility analysis of vagus nerve stimulators for adults with medically refractory epilepsy, Seizure, 2003-Jul; 12(5):1059-1311; 249-56",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vagus nerve stimulator implantation vs. No device implantation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,6.00,2.00,28950,United Kingdom,1996,74527.51

OBJECTIVE: To assess the implications of vaccinating black and nonblack people 50 through 64 years of age against invasive pneumococcal disease. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Published literature for vaccination effectiveness and cost estimates; data on disease incidence and case-fatality rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. TARGET POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort 50 through 64 years of age with the 1995 U.S. age distribution. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination compared with no vaccination. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental medical costs and health effects, in quality-adjusted life-years per vaccinee. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Vaccination saved medical costs and improved health among high-risk black people (27.55 dollars savings per vaccinee) and nonblack people (5.92 dollars savings per vaccinee), excluding survivors"" future costs. For low-risk black and nonblack people and the overall general population, vaccination cost 2477 dollars, 8195 dollars, and 3434 dollars, respectively, to gain 1 year of healthy life. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Excluding survivors"" future costs, in the general immunocompetent population, cost per quality-adjusted life-year in global worst-case results ranged from 21 513 dollars for black people to 68 871 dollars for nonblack people; in the high-risk population, cost ranged from 11 548 dollars for black people to 39 000 dollars for nonblack people. In the global best case, vaccination was cost-saving for black and nonblack people in the general immunocompetent and high-risk populations, excluding survivors"" future costs. The cost-effectiveness range was narrower in probabilistic sensitivity analyses, with 95% probabilistic intervals ranging from cost-saving to 1594 dollars for black people and from cost-saving to 12 273 dollars for nonblack people in the general immunocompetent population.

PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. METHODS: The cost effectiveness of NA/EE was assessed as both a first- and second-line therapy in comparison with conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625mg and medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5mg (CEE/MPA) and no therapy. Analysis was conducted within a Markov model with states relating to the presence and absence of vaginal bleeding, menopausal symptoms and hip fracture. Analysis forecasted life expectancy, QALYs and lifetime costs for a 50-year-old menopausal woman. Compliance was modelled related to menopausal symptoms and vaginal bleeding. For the base-case analysis, it was assumed that compliant women would take therapy for up to 5 years. Sensitivity analysis assumed therapy was taken only for 1 year. RESULTS: Compared with both CEE/MPA and no therapy, NA/EE led to an increase in both costs and QALYs, both as a first- and second-line therapy. For first-line therapy, the incremental cost per QALY gained for NA/EE was $2200 Canadian dollars ($Can; 1999 values) [compared with no therapy] and was $Can20 300 (compared with CEE/MPA).

2100,Economic evaluation of norethisterone acetate/ethinylestradiol (FemHRT) for women with menopausal symptoms,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of a continuous combined oral preparation of norethisterone (norethindrone) acetate and ethinylestradiol (NA/EE) [FemHRT] as both a first-line and second-line therapy for menopausal women. PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. METHODS: The cost effectiveness of NA/EE was assessed as both a first- and second-line therapy in comparison with conjugated equine oestrogen 0.625mg and medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5mg (CEE/MPA) and no therapy. Analysis was conducted within a Markov model with states relating to the presence and absence of vaginal bleeding, menopausal symptoms and hip fracture. Analysis forecasted life expectancy, QALYs and lifetime costs for a 50-year-old menopausal woman. Compliance was modelled related to menopausal symptoms and vaginal bleeding. For the base-case analysis, it was assumed that compliant women would take therapy for up to 5 years. Sensitivity analysis assumed therapy was taken only for 1 year. RESULTS: Compared with both CEE/MPA and no therapy, NA/EE led to an increase in both costs and QALYs, both as a first- and second-line therapy. For first-line therapy, the incremental cost per QALY gained for NA/EE was $2200 Canadian dollars ($Can; 1999 values) [compared with no therapy] and was $Can20 300 (compared with CEE/MPA). For second-line therapy, the incremental cost per QALY gained for NA/EE was $Can900 (compared with no therapy) and was $Can16 400 (compared with CEE/MPA). Results were robust to most sensitivity analyses.
