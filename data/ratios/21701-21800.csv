21701,Optimizing Management of Patients with Barrett's Esophagus and Low-grade or No Dysplasia Based On Comparative Modeling: Optimizing Barrett's esophagus management,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic treatment is recommended for patients with Barrett''s esophagus (BE) with high-grade dysplasia, yet clinical management recommendations are inconsistent for patients with BE without dysplasia (NDBE) or with low-grade dysplasia (LGD). We used a comparative modeling analysis to identify optimal management strategies for these patients. METHODS: We used 3 independent population-based models to simulate cohorts of 60-year-old individuals with BE in the United States. We followed each cohort until death without surveillance and treatment (natural disease progression), compared with 78 different strategies of management for patients with NDBE or LGD. We determined the optimal strategy using cost-effectiveness analyses, at a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: In the 3 models, the average cumulative incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma was 111 cases, with costs totaling $5.7 million per 1000 men with BE. Surveillance and treatment of men with BE prevented 23%-75% of cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma , but increased costs to $6.2-$17.3 million per 1000 men with BE. The optimal strategy was surveillance every 3 years for men with NDBE and treatment of LGD after confirmation by repeat endoscopy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $53,044/QALY). The average results for women were consistent with the results for men for LGD management, but the optimal surveillance interval for women with NDBE was 5 years (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $36,045/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Based on analyses from 3 population-based models, the optimal management strategy for patient with BE and LGD is endoscopic eradication, but only after LGD is confirmed by a repeat endoscopy. The optimal strategy for patients with NDBE is endoscopic surveillance, using a 3-year interval for men and a 5-year interval for women.",2019-01-31103,31816445,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,Amir-Houshang Omidvari,2019,/,,No,31816445,"Amir-Houshang Omidvari; Yuri Wanderley Cavalcanti; Leopoldina de Fatima Dan de Almeida; Edson Hilan Gomes de Lucena; Livia Fernandes Probst; Denise de Fatima Barros Cavalcante; Antonio Carlos Frias; Jaqueline Vilela Bulgareli; Antonio Carlos Pereira; Optimizing Management of Patients with Barrett's Esophagus and Low-grade or No Dysplasia Based On Comparative Modeling: Optimizing Barrett's esophagus management, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2019 Jun 18; ():1542-3565",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Procedure, Surgical","surveillance every 5-years, endoscopic eradication therapy for low-grade dysplasia with confirmation vs. No surveillance, endoscopic eradication therapy for low-grade dysplasia",Whites with non-dysplasia or low-grade dysplasia,Not Stated,60 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,19779,United States,2015,21597.7

The average results for women were consistent with the results for men for LGD management, but the optimal surveillance interval for women with NDBE was 5 years (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $36,045/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Based on analyses from 3 population-based models, the optimal management strategy for patient with BE and LGD is endoscopic eradication, but only after LGD is confirmed by a repeat endoscopy.

21712,Optimizing Management of Patients with Barrett's Esophagus and Low-grade or No Dysplasia Based On Comparative Modeling: Optimizing Barrett's esophagus management,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Endoscopic treatment is recommended for patients with Barrett''s esophagus (BE) with high-grade dysplasia, yet clinical management recommendations are inconsistent for patients with BE without dysplasia (NDBE) or with low-grade dysplasia (LGD). We used a comparative modeling analysis to identify optimal management strategies for these patients. METHODS: We used 3 independent population-based models to simulate cohorts of 60-year-old individuals with BE in the United States. We followed each cohort until death without surveillance and treatment (natural disease progression), compared with 78 different strategies of management for patients with NDBE or LGD. We determined the optimal strategy using cost-effectiveness analyses, at a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: In the 3 models, the average cumulative incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma was 111 cases, with costs totaling $5.7 million per 1000 men with BE. Surveillance and treatment of men with BE prevented 23%-75% of cases of esophageal adenocarcinoma , but increased costs to $6.2-$17.3 million per 1000 men with BE. The optimal strategy was surveillance every 3 years for men with NDBE and treatment of LGD after confirmation by repeat endoscopy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $53,044/QALY).

21719,Better care for less money: cost-effectiveness of integrated care in multi-episode patients with severe psychotic disorders,"OBJECTIVE: To compare cost-effectiveness of integrated care with therapeutic assertive community treatment (IC-TACT) versus standard care (SC) in multiple episode psychosis. METHOD: 12-month IC-TACT in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum and bipolar I disorders were compared with a historical control group. Primary outcomes were entropy-balanced cost-effectiveness based on mental health care costs from a payers'' perspective and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) as a measure of health effects during 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: At baseline, patients in IC-TACT (n=214) had significantly higher illness severity and lower functioning than SC (n=56). Over 12 months, IC-TACT had significantly lower days in inpatient (10.3+/-20.5 vs. 28.2+/-44.9; p=0.005) and day-clinic care (2.6+/-16.7 vs. 16.4+/-33.7; p=.004) and correspondingly lower costs (euro-55,084). Within outpatient care, IC-TACT displayed a higher number of treatment contacts (116.3+/-45.3 vs. 15.6+/-6.3) and higher related costs (euro+1,417). Both resulted in lower total costs in IC-TACT (mean difference=euro-13,248+/-2,975, p<0.001). Adjusted incremental QALYs were significantly higher for IC-TACT versus SC (+0.10+/-0.37, p=0.05). The probability of cost-effectiveness of IC-TACT was constantly higher than 99%. CONCLUSION: IC-TACT was cost-effective compared with SC.

21720,Effectiveness and cost-utility of a multifaceted eHealth strategy to improve back pain beliefs of patients with non-specific low back pain: a cluster randomised trial,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness and cost-utility of a multifaceted eHealth strategy compared to usual care in improving patients'' back pain beliefs, and in decreasing disability and absenteeism. DESIGN: Stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial with parallel economic evaluation. SETTING: Dutch primary healthcare. PARTICIPANTS: Patients diagnosed with non-specific low back pain by their general practitioner or physiotherapist. Patients with serious comorbidities or confirmed pregnancy were excluded. 779 patients were randomised into intervention group (n=331, 59% female; 60.4% completed study) or control group (n=448, 57% female; 77.5% completed study). INTERVENTIONS: The intervention consisted of a multifaceted eHealth strategy that included a (mobile) website, digital monthly newsletters, and social media platforms. The website provided information about back pain, practical advice (eg, on self-management), working and returning to work with back pain, exercise tips, and short video messages from healthcare providers and patients providing information and tips. The control consisted of a digital patient information letter. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded to group allocation. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was back pain beliefs. Secondary outcome measures were disability and absenteeism, and for the preplanned economic evaluation quality of life and societal costs were measured. RESULTS: There were no between-group differences in back pain beliefs, disability, or absenteeism. Mean intervention costs were euro70- and the societal cost difference was euro535-in favour of the intervention group, but no significant cost savings were found. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio indicated that the intervention dominated usual care and the probability of cost-effectiveness was 0.85 on a willingness-to-pay of euro10.000/quality adjusted life year (QALY). CONCLUSIONS: A multifaceted eHealth strategy was not effective in improving patients'' back pain beliefs or in decreasing disability and absenteeism, but showed promising cost-utility results based on QALYs.

21721,Screening for Asymptomatic Coronary Artery Disease in Waitlisted Kidney Transplant Candidates: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: On account of the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease in patients with kidney failure, clinical practice guidelines recommend regular screening for asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients on the kidney transplant waitlist. To date, the cost-effectiveness of such screening has not been evaluated. A Canadian-Australasian randomized controlled trial of screening kidney transplant candidates for CAD (CARSK) is currently is being conducted to answer this question. We conducted a cost-utility analysis to determine, before completion of the trial, the cost-effectiveness of no further screening versus regular screening for asymptomatic CAD and to evaluate potential influential variables that may affect results of the economic evaluation. STUDY DESIGN: A modeled cost-utility analysis. SETTING & POPULATION: A theoretical cohort of adult Australian and New Zealand kidney transplant candidates on the waitlist. INTERVENTION: No further screening for asymptomatic CAD versus regular protocolized screening (annual or second yearly) for CAD after kidney transplant waitlisting. OUTCOMES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, reported as cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). MODEL, PERSPECTIVES, & TIMEFRAME: Markov microsimulation model, health system perspective and over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of no further screening was $11,122 per QALY gained when compared with regular screening. No further screening increased survival by 0.49 life-year or 0.35 QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses identified the costs of transplantation in the first year and CAD prevalence as the most influential variables. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that 94% of the simulations were cost-effective below a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY gained. LIMITATIONS: Rates of cardiovascular events in waitlisted candidates and transplant recipients are limited in the contemporary era. The results may not be generalizable to populations outside Australia and New Zealand. CONCLUSIONS: No further screening for CAD after waitlisting is likely to be cost-effective and may improve survival. Precision around CAD prevalence estimates and health care resource use will reduce existing uncertainty.",2019-01-31115,31810731,Am J Kidney Dis,Tracey Ying,2019,/,,No,31810731,"Tracey Ying; Rachel Kidman; Luciane R Piccolo; Hans-Peter Kohler; Screening for Asymptomatic Coronary Artery Disease in Waitlisted Kidney Transplant Candidates: A Cost-Utility Analysis, Am J Kidney Dis, 2019 Apr 23; ():1523-6838",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Screening,no further coronary artery disease screening vs. Standard/Usual Care- Coronary artery disease screening,"In transplantation waitlist, no symptoms of coronary artery disease",69 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,11122,Australia,2016,8919.05
21722,Neer Type-II Distal Clavicle Fractures: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Fixation Techniques,"BACKGROUND: Neer type-II distal clavicle fractures are unstable and are generally appropriately managed with operative fixation. Fixation options include locking plates, hook plates, and suture button devices. No consensus on optimal technique exists. METHODS: A decision tree model was created describing fixation of Neer type-II fractures using hook plates, locking plates, or suture buttons. Outcomes included uneventful healing, symptomatic implant removal, deep infection requiring debridement, and nonunion requiring revision. Weighted averages derived from a systematic review were used for probabilities. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The ICER is defined as the ratio of the difference in cost and difference in effectiveness of each strategy, and is measured in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The model was evaluated using thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all outcome probabilities for each fixation strategy to assess cost-effectiveness across a range of values. RESULTS: Forty-three papers met final inclusion criteria. Using suture buttons as the reference case in the health-care cost model, suture button repair was dominant (both less expensive and clinically superior). Hook plates cost substantially more ($5,360.52) compared with suture buttons and locking plates ($3,713.50 and $4,007.44, respectively). Suture buttons and locking plates yielded similar clinical outcomes (0.92 and 0.91 QALY, respectively). Suture button dominance persisted in the societal perspective model. Sensitivity analysis on outcome probabilities showed that locking plates became the most cost-effective strategy if the revision rate after their use was lowered to 2.2%, from the overall average in the sources of >19%. No other changes in outcome probabilities for any of the 3 techniques allowed suture buttons to be surpassed as the most cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of suture buttons is driven by low revision rates and high uneventful healing rates.

21723,Neer Type-II Distal Clavicle Fractures: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Fixation Techniques,"BACKGROUND: Neer type-II distal clavicle fractures are unstable and are generally appropriately managed with operative fixation. Fixation options include locking plates, hook plates, and suture button devices. No consensus on optimal technique exists. METHODS: A decision tree model was created describing fixation of Neer type-II fractures using hook plates, locking plates, or suture buttons. Outcomes included uneventful healing, symptomatic implant removal, deep infection requiring debridement, and nonunion requiring revision. Weighted averages derived from a systematic review were used for probabilities. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by calculating incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The ICER is defined as the ratio of the difference in cost and difference in effectiveness of each strategy, and is measured in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The model was evaluated using thresholds of $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY. Sensitivity analysis was performed on all outcome probabilities for each fixation strategy to assess cost-effectiveness across a range of values. RESULTS: Forty-three papers met final inclusion criteria. Using suture buttons as the reference case in the health-care cost model, suture button repair was dominant (both less expensive and clinically superior). Hook plates cost substantially more ($5,360.52) compared with suture buttons and locking plates ($3,713.50 and $4,007.44, respectively). Suture buttons and locking plates yielded similar clinical outcomes (0.92 and 0.91 QALY, respectively). Suture button dominance persisted in the societal perspective model. Sensitivity analysis on outcome probabilities showed that locking plates became the most cost-effective strategy if the revision rate after their use was lowered to 2.2%, from the overall average in the sources of >19%. No other changes in outcome probabilities for any of the 3 techniques allowed suture buttons to be surpassed as the most cost-effective.

METHODS: We developed a health state transition model to capture the natural history of HCV. A cost-effectiveness analysis of DAAs from the perspective of a public healthcare payer in Japan with a lifetime horizon over annual cycles was performed. Treatment attributes, baseline demographics, transition probabilities, health-state utilities, and costs data were extracted from publications. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 2% per annum. In the base case we focused on genotype 1 (GT1) treatment-naive patients without cirrhosis. The scenario analysis examined a pan-genotype treatment in GT1-3 (i.e., portfolio), treatment-naive, and treatment-experienced patients. The portfolio cost-effectiveness of DAAs was derived by calculating a weighted average of patient segments defined by treatment history, cirrhosis status, and genotype. RESULTS: The base case results indicated that glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was dominant (i.e., generating higher quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] and lower lifetime costs) compared to all other DAAs. The predicted lifetime risk of hepatocellular carcinoma was 3.66% for glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir, 4.99% for elbasvir/grazoprevir, and 5.27% for daclatasvir/asunaprevir/beclabuvir. In scenario analysis the glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB) portfolio dominated the sofosbuvir (SOF)-based portfolio (namely sofosbuvir/ledipasvir in GT1-2 and sofosbuvir + ribavirin in GT3). The base case probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) showed that glecaprevir/pibrentasvir was cost-effective in 93.4% of the simulations for a willingness-to-pay/QALY range of Japanese yen (JPY) 1.6-20 million. The PSA for the portfolio scenario indicated that the GLE/PIB portfolio was cost-effective in 100% of simulations until the willingness-to-pay/QALY reached JPY 5.2 million; this proportion decreased to 69.4% at a willingness-to-pay/QALY of JPY 20 million.

21730,Economic Value of Adjunctive Brivaracetam Treatment Strategy for Focal Onset Seizures in Finland,"INTRODUCTION: There is an unmet need for well-tolerated antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that effectively control focal onset seizures. This study aimed to evaluate the economic value of new AEDs in the treatment of focal onset seizure, with or without secondary generalization, in Finnish adults and adolescents with epilepsy, comparing brivaracetam with perampanel as adjunctive AEDs. METHODS: Economic value was assessed using cost-utility analysis. Periods of AED initiation, titration, response assessment (seizure freedom, >/= 50% reduction, no response), switching in no response or treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), and death were simulated using a discrete-event simulation model. Responses and switching were simulated based on a comprehensive Bayesian network meta-analysis. The primary modeled outcome was the 3%/year discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), payer costs (year 2017 Euro) per patient, and net monetary benefit (NMB) were secondary outcomes. Probabilistic and comprehensive deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Brivaracetam was more efficacious and had fewer TEAEs than perampanel and other AEDs. Modeled average 5-year QALYs and costs were 3.671 and euro28,297 for brivaracetam and 3.611 and euro27,979 for perampanel, respectively. The resulting ICER for brivaracetam versus perampanel was only euro5345/QALY gained in a deterministic base case scenario. Brivaracetam had a positive NMB and high probability of cost-effectiveness of euro1190 and 71% or euro1944 and 80% with the assumed willingness to pay of euro25,358 or euro38,036/QALY gained, respectively. The primary result was robust, with a positive NMB persistent in all sensitivity analysis scenarios. When switching from brivaracetam to perampanel was excluded from the modeling or switching from perampanel to brivaracetam was included, brivaracetam was cost-saving and more effective than perampanel (dominant). CONCLUSION: These simulated comparisons demonstrated that brivaracetam was more effective and potentially also more affordable than perampanel. Thus, brivaracetam is likely a cost-effective and net beneficial alternative to perampanel for treatment of focal onset seizures.

21731,Health economic evaluation of rivaroxaban in the treatment of patients with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease,"AIMS: In the COMPASS trial, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily (bid) plus acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100 mg once daily (od) performed better than ASA 100 mg od alone in reducing the rate of cardiovascular disease, stroke, or myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban plus ASA vs. ASA alone over a lifetime horizon, from the UK National Health System perspective. METHODS AND RESULTS: The base case analysis assumed that patients entered the model in the event-free health state, with the possibility to experience </=2 events, transitioning every three-month cycle, through acute and post-acute health states of MI, ischaemic stroke (IS), or intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), and death. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life years-all discounted at 3.5%-and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted, as well as scenario analyses. In the model, patients on rivaroxaban plus ASA lived for an average of 14.0 years with no IS/MI/ICH, and gained 9.7 QALYs at a cost of pound13 947, while those receiving ASA alone lived for an average of 12.7 years and gained 9.3 QALYs at a cost of pound8126. The ICER was pound16 360 per QALY. This treatment was cost-effective in 98% of 5000 iterations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30 000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: This Markov model suggests that rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid plus ASA is a cost-effective alternative to ASA alone in patients with chronic CAD or PAD.",2019-01-31123,31807773,Cardiovasc Res,Martin R Cowie,2019,/,,No,31807773,"Martin R Cowie; Kristian Heldal; Karsten Midtvedt; Kjersti Lonning; Tor Iversen; Kjersti Helene Hernaes; Vasiliki Tsarpali; Anna Varberg Reisaeter; Tomm Bernklev; Health economic evaluation of rivaroxaban in the treatment of patients with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease, Cardiovasc Res, 2019 Nov 28; ():1755-3245",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,rivaroxaban plus acetylsalicylic acid vs. Acetylsalicylic acid alone,Not Stated,67 Years,67 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,16360,United Kingdom,2017,22266.37

A cost-utility study,"Background: In the elderly, kidney transplantation is associated with increased survival and improved health-related quality of life compared with dialysis treatment. We aimed to study the short-term health economic effects of transplantation in a population of elderly kidney transplant candidates. Methods: Self-perceived health, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were evaluated and compared 1 year before and 1 year after kidney transplantation in patients included in a single-centre prospective study of 289 transplant candidates >/=65 years of age. Results: Self-perceived health and QALYs both significantly improved after transplantation. At 1 year, the costs per QALY were substantially higher for transplantation (euro88 100 versus euro76 495), but preliminary analyses suggest a favourable long-term health economic effect.

21733,Cost-Effectiveness Of The SQ((R)) Grass SLIT-Tablet In Children With Allergic Rhinitis: A German Payer Perspective,"Background: The Grazax Asthma Prevention (GAP) trial has recently demonstrated significant reductions in the odds of asthma symptoms or medication use in patients treated with SQ((R)) grass SLIT-tablet relative to placebo, both in combination with allergy and asthma pharmacotherapy. The objective of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of SQ grass SLIT-tablet relative to placebo in children with AR from the perspective of a German healthcare payer. Methods: A cost-utility model was developed in Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) to evaluate the cost-utility of SQ grass SLIT-tablet in combination with pharmacotherapy versus pharmacotherapy alone in patients with AR. Transition probabilities were derived from the GAP trial, and costs were taken from a real-world insurance database analysis. Future costs and effects were discounted at 3% per annum, and extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Over a 10-year time horizon, the base case analysis showed an increase in overall treatment costs of euro897 per child being treated with SQ grass SLIT-tablet relative to pharmacotherapy alone. The increased treatment costs were accompanied by an improvement in patient quality of life of 0.10 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) yielding an ICER of euro8978 per QALY gained, falling well below a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro17,800 per QALY gained. The base case results were insensitive to changes in all individual model parameters. Discussion: Improvements in quality of life with the SQ grass SLIT-tablet would be accompanied by only a modest increase in costs over a 10-year time horizon, with the SQ grass SLIT-tablet therefore representing excellent value for money from the German healthcare payer perspective.",2019-01-31125,31807037,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Christian Vogelberg,2019,11 /,637-649,No,31807037,"Christian Vogelberg; Lars Lind; Samira Salihovic; Andrea Ganna; Johan Sundstrom; Corey D Broeckling; Patrik K Magnusson; Nancy L Pedersen; Agneta Siegbahn; Jessica Prenni; Tove Fall; Erik Ingelsson; Johan Arnlov; Cost-Effectiveness Of The SQ((R)) Grass SLIT-Tablet In Children With Allergic Rhinitis: A German Payer Perspective, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2019; 11():1178-6981; 637-649",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,sq grass sublingual tablet vs. Standard/Usual Care- Pharmacotherapy,Not Stated,12 Years,5 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,8978,Euro,2017,10712.27

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of AHT in people aged 80 years and older. METHODS: A Markov model compared AHT with no blood pressure treatment for prevention of cardiovascular disease. Outcomes were new stroke, coronary heart disease, and diabetes, with falls included as a potential complication of AHT. Costs were evaluated from a health system perspective. Incidence, mortality, and costs of healthcare utilization were estimated from linked primary and secondary care electronic health records for 98 220 individuals aged 80 years and older. Clinical effectiveness estimates were from the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the base case, AHT was associated with an additional 725 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and pound4.3 million per 1000, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound5977 per QALY. The ICER was most sensitive to the cost of falls and relative risk reduction in stroke incidence. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis gave 95% uncertainty intervals: pound5057 to pound8398 per QALY in men and pound4955 to pound8218 per QALY in women. AHT for secondary prevention in participants with coronary heart disease gave an ICER of pound9903 per QALY.

21737,Cost-Effectiveness of Drug-Eluting Stents in Elderly Patients With Coronary Artery Disease: The SENIOR Trial,"BACKGROUND: Elderly patients receive bare metal stents instead of drug-eluting stents (DES) to shorten the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). The SENIOR trial compared outcomes between these 2 types of stents combined with a short duration of DAPT. A significant decrease in the number of patients with at least 1 major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) was noted in the DES group. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this article was to perform an economic evaluation of the SENIOR trial. METHODS: This evaluation was performed separately in 5 participating countries using pooled patient-level data from all study patients and country-specific unit costs and utility values. Costs, MACCEs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated in both arms at 1 year, and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated. Uncertainty was explored by probabilistic bootstrapping. RESULTS: A total of 1200 patients underwent randomization. The average total cost per patient was higher in the DES group. The number of MACCEs and average QALYs were not statistically different between the 2 groups.

21742,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for Influenza Vaccination Coverage and Timing in Tropical and Subtropical Climate Settings: A Modeling Study,"BACKGROUND: The lack of seasonality in influenza epidemics in the tropics makes the application of well-established temperate zone national vaccination plans challenging. OBJECTIVES: We developed an individual-based simulation model to study optimal vaccination scheduling and assess cost-effectiveness of these vaccination schedules in scenarios of no influenza seasonality and the seasonality regimes of Singapore, Taipei, and Tokyo. METHODS: The simulation models heterogeneities in human contact networks, levels of protective antibodies following infection, the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, and seasonality. Using a no intervention baseline, we consider 3 alternative vaccination strategies: (1) annual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, (2) biannual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, and (3) annual vaccination for all elderly and a fraction of the remaining population. We considered 5 vaccination uptake rates for each strategy and modeled the estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), indicating the cost-effectiveness of each scenario. RESULTS: In Singapore, annual vaccination for a proportion of elderly is largely cost-effective. However, with fixed uptake rates, partial biannual vaccination for the elderly yields a higher ICER than partial annual vaccination for the elderly, resulting in a cost-ineffective ICER. The most optimal strategy is the total vaccination of all the elderly and a proportion of individuals from other age groups, which results in a cost-saving ICER. This finding is consistent across different seasonality regimes.

Using a no intervention baseline, we consider 3 alternative vaccination strategies: (1) annual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, (2) biannual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, and (3) annual vaccination for all elderly and a fraction of the remaining population. We considered 5 vaccination uptake rates for each strategy and modeled the estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), indicating the cost-effectiveness of each scenario. RESULTS: In Singapore, annual vaccination for a proportion of elderly is largely cost-effective. However, with fixed uptake rates, partial biannual vaccination for the elderly yields a higher ICER than partial annual vaccination for the elderly, resulting in a cost-ineffective ICER. The most optimal strategy is the total vaccination of all the elderly and a proportion of individuals from other age groups, which results in a cost-saving ICER. This finding is consistent across different seasonality regimes. CONCLUSIONS: Tropical countries like Singapore can have comparably cost-effective vaccination strategies as found in countries with winter epidemics.

OBJECTIVES: We developed an individual-based simulation model to study optimal vaccination scheduling and assess cost-effectiveness of these vaccination schedules in scenarios of no influenza seasonality and the seasonality regimes of Singapore, Taipei, and Tokyo. METHODS: The simulation models heterogeneities in human contact networks, levels of protective antibodies following infection, the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, and seasonality. Using a no intervention baseline, we consider 3 alternative vaccination strategies: (1) annual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, (2) biannual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, and (3) annual vaccination for all elderly and a fraction of the remaining population. We considered 5 vaccination uptake rates for each strategy and modeled the estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), indicating the cost-effectiveness of each scenario. RESULTS: In Singapore, annual vaccination for a proportion of elderly is largely cost-effective. However, with fixed uptake rates, partial biannual vaccination for the elderly yields a higher ICER than partial annual vaccination for the elderly, resulting in a cost-ineffective ICER.

OBJECTIVES: We developed an individual-based simulation model to study optimal vaccination scheduling and assess cost-effectiveness of these vaccination schedules in scenarios of no influenza seasonality and the seasonality regimes of Singapore, Taipei, and Tokyo. METHODS: The simulation models heterogeneities in human contact networks, levels of protective antibodies following infection, the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, and seasonality. Using a no intervention baseline, we consider 3 alternative vaccination strategies: (1) annual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, (2) biannual vaccination for a percentage of the elderly, and (3) annual vaccination for all elderly and a fraction of the remaining population. We considered 5 vaccination uptake rates for each strategy and modeled the estimated costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), indicating the cost-effectiveness of each scenario. RESULTS: In Singapore, annual vaccination for a proportion of elderly is largely cost-effective. However, with fixed uptake rates, partial biannual vaccination for the elderly yields a higher ICER than partial annual vaccination for the elderly, resulting in a cost-ineffective ICER.
