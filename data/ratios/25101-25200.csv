25101,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate Health Index in Decision Making for Initial Prostate Biopsy,"BACKGROUND: Clinical studies have suggested that prostate health index (phi) outperforms prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests in prostate cancer detection. The cost-effectiveness of phi with different cutoffs is poorly understood in the context of decision making for prostate biopsy. METHODS: In a multicenter cohort, 3,348 men with elevated total PSA (tPSA) underwent initial prostate biopsy from August 2013 to May 2019. We constructed a decision model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of different phi cutoffs. Total costs and reimbursement payments were based on the fee schedule of Shanghai Basic Medical Insurance and converted into United States dollars ($). Two willingness-to-pay thresholds were estimated as one or three times the average gross domestic product per capita of China ($7,760 or $23,279, respectively). RESULTS: The total costs of prostate biopsy and PSA tests were estimated at $315 and $19, respectively. The cost of phi test varied between $72 to $130 in different medical centers. Under different phi cutoffs (from 23 to 35), phi test predicted reductions of 420 (21.7%) to 972 (50.2%) in unnecessary biopsies, with a total gain of 23.77-57.58 quality adjusted life-years compared to PSA tests. All the cutoffs would be cost-effective for patients with tPSA levels of 2-10 ng/ml. Applying 27 as the cutoff was cost-effective for each tPSA range, with missing positive cases ranging from 11 (3.4%) to 33 (11.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Using phi test was cost-effective in the decision-making process for initial prostate biopsy, especially for patients with tPSA values between 2-10 ng/ml. The phi cutoff of 27 was cost-effective regardless of tPSA ranges and should be recommended from a health-economic perspective.",2020-01-35177,33330035,Front Oncol,Da Huang,2020,10 /,565382,No,33330035,"Da Huang; Xiaoqun Yang; Yishuo Wu; Xiaoling Lin; Danfeng Xu; Rong Na; Jianfeng Xu; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prostate Health Index in Decision Making for Initial Prostate Biopsy, Front Oncol, 2020; 10():2234-943X; 565382",QALY,China,Not Stated,Diagnostic,"biopsy testing using prostate health index (phi=23), total prostate-specific antigen 2-10 ng/ml vs. Standard/Usual Care- prostate biopsy based on prostate-specific antigen test","Shanghai, underwent initial prostate biopsy, tPSA >= 2.0 ng/ml",74 Years,62 Years,Male,Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,2247,United States,2019,2274.72

25105,Cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab in patients with a history of myocardial infarction in Sweden,"AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab added to standard-of-care lipid-lowering treatment (maximum tolerated dose [MTD] of statin and ezetimibe) in Swedish patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). METHODS AND RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using a Markov model based on Swedish observational data on cardiovascular event rates and efficacy from the FOURIER trial. Three risk profiles were considered: recent MI in the previous year; history of MI with a risk factor; and history of MI with a second event within 2 years. For each population, three minimum baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were considered: 2.5?mmol/L (˜100?mg/dL), based on the current reimbursement recommendation in Sweden); 1.8?mmol/L (˜70?mg/dL), based on 2016 ESC/EAS guidelines; and 1.4?mmol/L (˜55?mg/dL), or 1.0?mmol/L (˜40?mg/dL) for MI with a second event, based on 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines. PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab was associated with increased quality-adjusted life-years and costs versus standard-of-care therapy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were below SEK700,000 (~€66,500), the generally accepted willingness-to-pay threshold in Sweden, for minimum LDL-C levels of 2.3 (recent MI), 1.7 (MI with a risk factor) and 1.7?mmol/L (MI with a second event). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that base-case results were robust to changes in model parameters. CONCLUSION: PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab added to MTD of statin and ezetimibe may be considered cost-effective at its list price for minimum LDL-C levels of 1.7-2.3?mmol/L, depending on risk profile, with ICERs below the accepted willingness-to-pay threshold in Sweden.",2020-01-35201,33063111,Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,Ulf Landmesser,2020,/,,No,33063111,"Ulf Landmesser; Peter Lindgren; Emil Hagström; Ben van Hout; Guillermo Villa; Peter Pemberton-Ross; Jorge Arellano; Maria Eriksson Svensson; Mahendra Sibartie; Gregg C Fonarow; Cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibition with evolocumab in patients with a history of myocardial infarction in Sweden, Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes, 2020 Dec 18; ():2058-1742",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,evolocumab + standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care- 20 or 40 mg atorvastatin daily + 10 mg ezetimibe,"myocardial infarction in the previous year, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 2.5 mmol/L",72 Years,72 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,623367,Sweden,2019,66765.24

OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening strategies in childhood cancer survivors. DESIGN: Collaborative simulation modeling using 2 Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network breast cancer models. DATA SOURCES: Childhood Cancer Survivor Study and published data. TARGET POPULATION: Women aged 20 years with a history of chest radiotherapy. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Payer. INTERVENTION: Annual MRI with or without mammography, starting at age 25, 30, or 35 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Breast cancer deaths averted, false-positive screening results, benign biopsy results, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Lifetime breast cancer mortality risk without screening was 10% to 11% across models. Compared with no screening, starting at age 25 years, annual mammography with MRI averted the most deaths (56% to 71%) and annual MRI (without mammography) averted 56% to 62%. Both strategies had the most screening tests, false-positive screening results, and benign biopsy results. For an ICER threshold of less than $100 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, screening beginning at age 30 years was preferred. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Assuming lower screening performance, the benefit of adding mammography to MRI increased in both models, although the conclusions about preferred starting age remained unchanged. LIMITATION: Elevated breast cancer risk was based on survivors diagnosed with childhood cancer between 1970 and 1986.

Thoracoscopic surgical ablation (SA) has shown promising efficacy in atrial fibrillation (AF). This multicentre randomized controlled trial tested whether SA was superior to CA as the first interventional strategy in de novo LSPAF. METHODS AND RESULTS : We randomized 120 LSPAF patients to SA or CA. All patients underwent predetermined lesion sets and implantable loop recorder insertion. Primary outcome was single procedure freedom from AF/atrial tachycardia (AT) =30?s without anti-arrhythmic drugs at 12?months. Secondary outcomes included clinical success (=75% reduction in AF/AT burden); procedure-related serious adverse events; changes in patients'' symptoms and quality-of-life scores; and cost-effectiveness. At 12?months, freedom from AF/AT was recorded in 26% (14/54) of patients in SA vs. 28% (17/60) in the CA group [OR 1.128, 95% CI (0.46-2.83), P?=?0.83]. Reduction in AF/AT burden =75% was recorded in 67% (36/54) vs. 77% (46/60) [OR 1.13, 95% CI (0.67-4.08), P?=?0.3] in SA and CA groups, respectively. Procedure-related serious adverse events within 30?days of intervention were reported in 15% (8/55) of patients in SA vs. 10% (6/60) in CA, P?=?0.46. One death was reported after SA. Improvements in AF symptoms were greater following CA. Over 12?months, SA was more expensive and provided fewer quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with CA (0.78 vs. 0.85, P?=?0.02). CONCLUSION : Single procedure thoracoscopic SA is not superior to CA in treating LSPAF. Catheter ablation provided greater improvements in symptoms and accrued significantly more QALYs during follow-up than SA.

Prevention and mitigation of cCMVi-related hearing loss will require an increase in newborn screening, which is not yet available in China. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of newborn screening strategies for cCMVi from the perspective of the Chinese health care system. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A decision tree for a simulated cohort population of 15?000?000 live births was developed to compare the costs and health effects of 3 mutually exclusive interventions: (1) no screening, (2) targeted screening using CMV polymerase chain reaction assay for newborns who fail a universal hearing screening, and (3) universal screening for CMV among all newborns. Markov diagrams were used to evaluate the lifetime horizon (76 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost, hearing-related health outcomes, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated based on a direct medical costs perspective. Costs and ICERs were reported in 2018 US dollars. RESULTS: Incidence of cCMVi among newborns was reported to be approximately 0.7% in China. Targeted screening was less costly but also less effective than universal screening, identifying 41% of cases needing antiviral treatment and preventing nearly half of less severe or profound hearing loss. To avoid 1 CMV-related severe or profound hearing loss, 13 and 16 newborns need to be treated by targeted and universal screening, respectively. The ICERs of targeted and universal screening vs no screening were $79 and $2087 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively, at the discounted rate of 3.5%. Both screening options were cost-effective for the Chinese health care system based on the willingness-to-pay threshold of 3?×?gross domestic product per capita. The sensitivity analysis showed that the prevalence of cCMVi, as well as diagnosis and treatment costs, were key factors that may be associated with decision-making.

25130,Cost-utility analysis of normothermic liver perfusion with the OrganOx metra compared to static cold storage in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Rising numbers of patients on the liver transplant waiting list has led to the utilization of organs from higher-risk donors that are more likely to be discarded and are prone to post-transplant complications. Storage and transportation of these livers at low temperatures can cause damage. OrganOx metra is a portable device intended to preserve and maintain the donated liver in normothermic conditions for up to 24?h prior to transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of normothermic machine perfusion with OrganOx metra in liver transplantation compared to the current practice of static cold storage (SCS). METHODS: A de novo decision analytic model (a decision tree along with a Markov model), based on current treatment pathways, was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes. Results from a randomized clinical trial and national standard sources were used to inform the model. Costs were estimated from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore uncertainty surrounding input parameters. RESULTS: Over a lifetime time horizon, liver transplantation with OrganOx metra was more costly and more effective than the current practice of static cold storage. The total costs per patient were £37,370 vs £46,711, and the total effectiveness per patient was 9.09 QALYs vs 10.27 QALYs for SCS and OrganOx metra groups, respectively. The estimated ICER was £7,876 per each QALY gained. Results from the PSA showed that use of OrganOx metra has 99% probability of being cost-effective at a £20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. OrganOx metra led to the utilization of 54 additional livers with patients experiencing lower rates of early allograft dysfunction and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Use of OrganOx metra for the perfusion and transportation of livers prior to transplantation is a cost-effective strategy. KEY POINTS FOR DECISION MAKERS Introduction of OrganOx metra into NHS could increase the utilisation of donated livers with patients experiencing lower rates of early allograft dysfunction and adverse events, compared with current practice. Results of the economic analysis indicate that the OrganOx metra is highly likely to be cost-effective and result in improved patient outcomes.",2020-01-35210,32729749,J Med Econ,Mehdi Javanbakht,2020,23 / 11,1284-1292,Yes,32729749,"Mehdi Javanbakht; Atefeh Mashayekhi; Miranda Trevor; Michael Branagan-Harris; Jowan Atkinson; Cost-utility analysis of normothermic liver perfusion with the OrganOx metra compared to static cold storage in the United Kingdom, J Med Econ, 2020 Nov; 23(11):1369-6998; 1284-1292",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Other,normothermic machine perfusion (organox metra device) vs. Standard/Usual Care- static cold storage,on liver transplant waitlist,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,7876,United Kingdom,2018,10847.21
25131,The Effect of Dose Escalation on the Cost-Effectiveness of Etanercept and Adalimumab with Methotrexate Among Patients with Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis,"BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occasionally increase their doses of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, especially the monoclonal antibody origin drugs such as adalimumab and infliximab, after inadequate response to the initial dose. Previous studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of various sequences of treatment for RA in the United States but have not considered the effect of dose escalation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of etanercept and adalimumab by incorporating the effect of dose escalation in moderate to severe RA patients. METHODS: We adapted the open-source Innovation and Value Initiative - Rheumatoid Arthritis model, version 1.0 to separately simulate the magnitude and time to dose escalation among RA patients taking adalimumab plus methotrexate or etanercept plus methotrexate from a societal perspective and lifetime horizon. An important assumption in the model was that dose escalation would increase treatment costs through its effect on the number of doses but would have no effect on effectiveness. We estimated the dose escalation parameters using the IBM MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases. We fit competing parametric survival models to model time to dose escalation and used model diagnostics to compare the fit of the competing models. We measured the magnitude of dose escalation as the percentage increase in the number of doses conditional on dose escalation. Finally, we used the parameterized model to simulate treatment sequences beginning with a TNF inhibitor (adalimumab, etanercept) followed by nonbiologic treatment. RESULTS: In baseline models without dose escalation, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of the etanercept treatment sequence relative to the adalimumab treatment sequence was $85,593. Incorporating dose escalation increased treatment costs for each sequence, but costs increased more with adalimumab, lowering the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to $9,001. At willingness-to-pay levels of $100,000, the etanercept sequence was more cost-effective compared with the adalimumab sequence, with probability 0.55 and 0.85 in models with and without dose escalation, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dose escalation has important effects on cost-effectiveness and should be considered when comparing biologic medications for the treatment of RA.

25132,The Effect of Dose Escalation on the Cost-Effectiveness of Etanercept and Adalimumab with Methotrexate Among Patients with Moderate to Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis,"BACKGROUND: Patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) occasionally increase their doses of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors, especially the monoclonal antibody origin drugs such as adalimumab and infliximab, after inadequate response to the initial dose. Previous studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of various sequences of treatment for RA in the United States but have not considered the effect of dose escalation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of etanercept and adalimumab by incorporating the effect of dose escalation in moderate to severe RA patients. METHODS: We adapted the open-source Innovation and Value Initiative - Rheumatoid Arthritis model, version 1.0 to separately simulate the magnitude and time to dose escalation among RA patients taking adalimumab plus methotrexate or etanercept plus methotrexate from a societal perspective and lifetime horizon. An important assumption in the model was that dose escalation would increase treatment costs through its effect on the number of doses but would have no effect on effectiveness. We estimated the dose escalation parameters using the IBM MarketScan Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases. We fit competing parametric survival models to model time to dose escalation and used model diagnostics to compare the fit of the competing models. We measured the magnitude of dose escalation as the percentage increase in the number of doses conditional on dose escalation. Finally, we used the parameterized model to simulate treatment sequences beginning with a TNF inhibitor (adalimumab, etanercept) followed by nonbiologic treatment. RESULTS: In baseline models without dose escalation, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of the etanercept treatment sequence relative to the adalimumab treatment sequence was $85,593. Incorporating dose escalation increased treatment costs for each sequence, but costs increased more with adalimumab, lowering the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to $9,001. At willingness-to-pay levels of $100,000, the etanercept sequence was more cost-effective compared with the adalimumab sequence, with probability 0.55 and 0.85 in models with and without dose escalation, respectively.

AIMS: This study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of DAAs to standard-of-care pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve patients without significant liver fibrosis and to compare different DAAs in patients who are treatment-experienced and/or have advanced liver disease. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate cost-effectiveness over a lifetime time horizon from the payer perspective. The target population was treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced HCV genotype 1 patients, stratified by degree of liver fibrosis. The model consists of 16 health states encompassing METAVIR fibrosis score (F0-F4), treatment success or failure, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplant, and liver-related death. The proportions of patients achieving sustained virologic response were obtained from clinical trials. Other inputs were obtained from published and local data.

25144,Long-term Clinical and Cost-effectiveness of Early Endovenous Ablation in Venous Ulceration: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"IMPORTANCE: One-year outcomes from the Early Venous Reflux Ablation (EVRA) randomized trial showed accelerated venous leg ulcer healing and greater ulcer-free time for participants who are treated with early endovenous ablation of lower extremity superficial reflux. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux in patients with venous leg ulceration. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between October 24, 2013, and September 27, 2016, the EVRA randomized clinical trial enrolled 450 participants (450 legs) with venous leg ulceration of less than 6 months'' duration and superficial venous reflux. Initially, 6555 patients were assessed for eligibility, and 6105 were excluded for reasons including ulcer duration greater than 6 months, healed ulcer by the time of randomization, deep venous occlusive disease, and insufficient superficial venous reflux to warrant ablation therapy, among others. A total of 426 of 450 participants (94.7%) from the vascular surgery departments of 20 hospitals in the United Kingdom were included in the analysis for ulcer recurrence. Surgeons, participants, and follow-up assessors were not blinded to the treatment group. Data were analyzed from August 11 to November 4, 2019. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive compression therapy with early endovenous ablation within 2 weeks of randomization (early intervention, n?=?224) or compression with deferred endovenous treatment of superficial venous reflux (deferred intervention, n?=?226). Endovenous modality and strategy were left to the preference of the treating clinical team. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome for the extended phase was time to first ulcer recurrence. Secondary outcomes included ulcer recurrence rate and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The early-intervention group consisted of 224 participants (mean [SD] age, 67.0 [15.5] years; 127 men [56.7%]; 206 White participants [92%]). The deferred-intervention group consisted of 226 participants (mean [SD] age, 68.9 [14.0] years; 120 men [53.1%]; 208 White participants [92%]). Of the 426 participants whose leg ulcer had healed, 121 (28.4%) experienced at least 1 recurrence during follow-up. There was no clear difference in time to first ulcer recurrence between the 2 groups (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.57-1.17; P?=?.28). Ulcers recurred at a lower rate of 0.11 per person-year in the early-intervention group compared with 0.16 per person-year in the deferred-intervention group (incidence rate ratio, 0.658; 95% CI, 0.480-0.898; P?=?.003). Time to ulcer healing was shorter in the early-intervention group for primary ulcers (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.12-1.64; P?=?.002). At 3 years, early intervention was 91.6% likely to be cost-effective at a willingness to pay of £20?000 ($26?283) per quality-adjusted life year and 90.8% likely at a threshold of £35?000 ($45?995) per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Early endovenous ablation of superficial venous reflux was highly likely to be cost-effective over a 3-year horizon compared with deferred intervention. Early intervention accelerated the healing of venous leg ulcers and reduced the overall incidence of ulcer recurrence.

25147,The potential of real-time analytics to improve care for mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit: an early economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Mechanical ventilation services are an important driver of the high costs of intensive care. An optimal interaction between a patient and a ventilator is therefore paramount. Suboptimal interaction is present when patients repeatedly demand, but do not receive, breathing support from a mechanical ventilator (>?30 times in 3 min), also known as an ineffective effort event (IEEV). IEEVs are associated with increased hospital mortality prolonged intensive care stay, and prolonged time on ventilation and thus development of real-time analytics that identify IEEVs is essential. To assist decision-making about further development we estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of real-time analytics that identify ineffective effort events. METHODS: We developed a cost-effectiveness model combining a decision tree and Markov model for long-term outcomes with data on current care from a Greek hospital and literature. A lifetime horizon and a healthcare payer perspective were used. Uncertainty about the results was assessed using sensitivity and scenario analyses to examine the impact of varying parameters like the intensive care costs per day and the effectiveness of treatment of IEEVs. RESULTS: Use of the analytics could lead to reduced mortality (3% absolute reduction), increased quality adjusted life years (0.21 per patient) and cost-savings (€264 per patient) compared to current care. Moreover, cost-savings for hospitals and health improvements can be incurred even if the treatment''s effectiveness is reduced from 30 to 10%. The estimated savings increase to €1,155 per patient in countries where costs of an intensive care day are high (e.g. the Netherlands). There is considerable headroom for development and the analytics generate savings when the price of the analytics per bed per year is below €7,307. Furthermore, even when the treatment''s effectiveness is 10%, the probability that the analytics are cost-effective exceeds 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing real-time analytics to identify ineffective effort events can lead to health and financial benefits. Therefore, it will be worthwhile to continue assessment of the effectiveness of the analytics in clinical practice and validate our findings. Eventually, their adoption in settings where costs of an intensive care day are high and ineffective efforts are frequent could yield a high return on investment.",2020-01-35279,33308234,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Lytske Bakker,2020,18 / 1,57,Yes,33308234,"Lytske Bakker; Katerina Vaporidi; Jos Aarts; William Redekop; The potential of real-time analytics to improve care for mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit: an early economic evaluation, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2020 Nov 7; 18(1):1478-7547; 57",QALY,Greece,Not Stated,Other,real time analytics for mechanically ventilated patients vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard/usual care,mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-1171.43,Euro,2019,-1328.34
25148,"CKDNET, a quality improvement project for prevention and reduction of chronic kidney disease in the Northeast Thailand","BACKGROUND: The incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is high in the Northeast Thailand compared to other parts of the country. Therefore, a broad program applying all levels of care is inevitable. This paper describes the results of the first year trial of the Chronic Kidney Disease Prevention in the Northeast Thailand (CKDNET), a quality improvement project collaboratively established to curb CKD. METHODS: We have covered general population, high risk persons and all stages of CKD patients with expansive strategies such as early screening, effective CKD registry, prevention and CKD comprehensive care models including cost effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: The preliminary results from CKD screening in general population of two rural sub-districts show that 26.8% of the screened population has CKD and 28.9% of CKD patients are of unknown etiology. We have established the CKD registry that has enlisted a total of 10.4 million individuals till date, of which 0.13 million are confirmed to have CKD. Pamphlets, posters, brochures and other media of 94 different types in the total number of 478,450 has been distributed for CKD education and awareness at the community level. A CKD guideline that suits for local situation has been formulated to deal the problem effectively and improve care. Moreover, our multidisciplinary intervention and self-management supports were effective in improving glomerular filtration rate (49.57 versus 46.23?ml/min/1.73?m(2); p <?0.05), blood pressure (129.6/76.1 versus 135.8/83.6?mmHg) and quality of life of CKD patients included in the program compared to those of the patients under conventional care. The cost effectiveness analysis revealed that lifetime cost for the comprehensive health services under the CKDNET program was 486,898 Baht compared to that of the usual care of 479,386 Baht, resulting in an incremental-cost effectiveness ratio of 18,702 Baht per quality-adjusted life years gained.

25149,Cost-effectiveness analysis of osimertinib for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer in Singapore,"OBJECTIVE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80-90% of all lung cancer cases and is usually associated with a poor prognosis. However, targeted therapy with first and second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has so far improved progression-free survival of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant NSCLC patients. Osimertinib, a third generation EGFR TKI has recently shown improved overall survival of 6.8?months in previously untreated EGFR mutant NSCLC patients. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib versus standard EGFR TKIs (gefitinib or erlotinib) as first-line treatment for advanced or metastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC patients in Singapore. METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states (progression-free, progressive disease, and death) was developed from the Singapore healthcare payer perspective. Survival curves based on the overall trial population from the FLAURA trial were extrapolated beyond trial period over a 10-year time horizon to estimate the underlying progression-free survival and overall survival parametric distributions. Health state utilities were derived from the literature and direct costs were sourced from public healthcare institutions in Singapore. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the impact of uncertainties and assumptions on cost-effectiveness results. RESULTS: Compared with first or second generation TKI, osimertinib had a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SG$418,839 (US$304,277) per quality-adjusted life year gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed the ICER was most sensitive to time horizon and variations in progression-free utility values. Scenario analyses showed that a 50% reduction in the cost of osimertinib was still associated with a high ICER that was unlikely to be deemed cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Osimertinib is not cost effective as a first-line treatment compared to standard EGFR TKIs in advanced EGFR mutant NSCLC patients in Singapore. The findings from our evaluation, alongside other considerations including the lack of survival benefit in the Asian subgroup of the FLAURA trial, will be useful to inform policy makers on funding decisions for NSCLC treatments in Singapore.",2020-01-35296,32886557,J Med Econ,Mohamed Ismail Abdul Aziz,2020,23 / 11,1330-1339,Yes,32886557,"Mohamed Ismail Abdul Aziz; Wayne Yong Xiang Foo; Chee Keong Toh; Wan-Teck Lim; Kwong Ng; Cost-effectiveness analysis of osimertinib for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation positive non-small cell lung cancer in Singapore, J Med Econ, 2020 Nov; 23(11):1369-6998; 1330-1339",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,osimertinib --> platinum doublet chemotherapy --> chemotherapy/immunotherapy --> best support care vs. Standard/Usual Care- erlotinib 150mg daily or gefinitib 250mg daily,"locally advanced, metastatic disease, epidermal growth factor receptor mutation",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,418839,Singapore,2018,320036.56

25152,What are the cost-savings and health benefits of improving detection and management for six high cardiovascular risk conditions in England? An economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost savings and health benefits of improving detection of individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in England, to determine to which patient subgroups these benefits arise, and to compare different strategies for subsequent management. DESIGN: An economic analysis using the School for Public Health Research CVD Prevention Model. SETTING: England 2018. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 16 and older with?one or more high cardiovascular risk conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease and high cholesterol. INTERVENTIONS: Detection of 100% of individuals with CVD high risk conditions compared with current levels of detection in England. Detected individuals are assumed to be managed either according to current levels of care or National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental and cumulative costs, savings, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), CVD cases, and net monetary benefit, from a UK NHS and Personal Social Services perspective. RESULTS: £68?billion could be saved, 4.9?million QALYs gained and 3.4?million cases of CVD prevented over 25 years if all individuals in England with the six CVD high risk conditions were diagnosed and subsequently managed at current levels. Additionally, if all detected individuals were managed according to NICE guidelines, total savings would be £61?billion, 8.1?million QALYs would be gained and 5.2?million CVD cases prevented. Most benefits come from detection of high cholesterol in the short term and diabetes in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial cost savings and health benefits would accrue if all individuals with conditions that increase CVD risk could be diagnosed, with detection of undiagnosed diabetes producing greatest benefits. Ensuring all conditions are managed according to NICE guidelines would further increase health benefits.

25153,Cost utility analysis of cryopreserved amniotic membrane versus topical cyclosporine for the treatment of moderate to severe dry eye syndrome,"BACKGROUND: The purpose is to perform a cost effectiveness analysis amniotic membrane vs. topical medications in the use of treating dry eye disease. A cost effectiveness analysis comparing amniotic membrane?+?other topical medications to topical cyclosporine A?+?other topical medications was evaluated using accepted decision tree modeling software. METHODS: TreeAge Pro 2019 software was used to evaluate the base case costs over a one year timeframe. Sensitivity analysis was performed on those variables which had the greatest effect on choosing one therapy versus the other based on cost. Monte Carlo simulation was run 1,000 times to determine the most effective, least costly alternative. Costs were evaluated from a societal level (direct?+?indirect). Quality of life utility scores were evaluated using known time tradeoffs from prior studies (scale 0-1; with 1 being perfect vision). RESULTS: Over a one year timeframe, the base case demonstrated that amniotic membrane?+?topical medications was the less expensive alternative and provided for incremental utilities versus topical cyclosporine?+?other medications (Cost/utility: $18,275/0.78 vs. $20,740/0.74). If examining direct costs only, topical cyclosporine was the least expensive option over a one year timeframe: $4,112 vs. $10,300. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that in order for topical cyclosporine to be the less expensive alternative the following variables would need to be:?<?68 days productivity lost;?<?$161 productivity lost/day;?>?79% of amniotic membrane implants would need to be re-implanted at month 4 (for whatever reason);?>?$2677 per amniotic membrane implant procedure (Medicare reimbursement rate);?>?96% positive response to topical cyclosporine A at month 4;?>?58% positive response to topical cyclosporine A at month 6 and;?<?54% probability clinical improvement with amniotic membrane. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that amniotic membrane was the less costly, most effective alternative 91.5% of the time. CONCLUSION: Based on improved outcomes using amniotic membrane, patient productivity was improved resulting in lower societal costs (less days lost from work). When considering the untoward effects of dry eye disease on societal costs, an improvement of the dry eye disease condition was accomplished most often with amniotic membrane.",2020-01-35340,33292325,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Jeffrey Voigt,2020,18 / 1,56,Yes,33292325,"Jeffrey Voigt; Steven R Levine; Cost utility analysis of cryopreserved amniotic membrane versus topical cyclosporine for the treatment of moderate to severe dry eye syndrome, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2020 Nov 7; 18(1):1478-7547; 56",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",cryopreserved amniotic membrane + topical medications vs. Standard/Usual Care- cyclosporine A + topical medications,"moderate, severe disease",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-61625,United States,2019,-62385.26
25154,The clinical and cost-effectiveness of supplemental parenteral nutrition in oncology,"BACKGROUND: Clinical guidelines recommend that parenteral nutrition (PN) is added to enteral nutrition (EN; supplemental parenteral nutrition (SPN)) in order to meet energy and protein needs in patients with cancer when EN alone is insufficient. However, although cancer-related malnutrition is common, there is poor awareness of the value of nutritional care, resulting in SPN being chronically underused. METHODS: We performed a targeted literature review and exploratory cost-utility analysis to gather evidence on the clinical effectiveness of SPN, and to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of SPN versus EN alone in an example cancer setting. RESULTS: The literature review identified studies linking SPN with malnutrition markers, and studies linking malnutrition markers with clinical outcomes. SPN was linked to improvements in body mass index (BMI), fat-free mass, phase angle (PhA) and prealbumin. Of these markers, BMI and PhA were strong predictors of survival. By combining published data, we generated indirect estimates of the overall survival HR associated with SPN; these ranged from 0.80 to 0.99 (mode 0.87). In patients with Stage IV inoperable pancreatic cancer, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio versus EN alone was estimated to be £41?350 or £91?501 depending on whether nursing and home delivery costs for EN and SPN were combined or provided separately. CONCLUSION: Despite a lack of direct evidence, the results of the literature review demonstrate that SPN may provide important clinical and quality of life benefits to patients with cancer.

25156,The cost-effectiveness of hypertonic saline inhalations for infant bronchiolitis,"BACKGROUND: Pharmacological treatment for bronchiolitis is primarily supportive because bronchodilators, steroids, and antibiotics, show little benefit. Clinical studies have suggested that nebulized 3% hypertonic solution is useful for infants with bronchiolitis. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the HS inhalations in infant bronchiolitis in a tropical country. METHODS: Decision tree analysis was used to calculate the expected costs and QALYs. All cost and use of resources were collected directly from medical invoices of 193 patient hospitalized with diagnosis of bronchiolitis in tertiary centers, of Rionegro, Colombia. The utility values applied to QALYs calculations were collected from the literature. The economic analysis was carried out from a societal perspective. RESULTS: The model showed that nebulized 3% hypertonic solution, was associated with lower total cost than controls (US $200vs US $240 average cost per patient), and higher QALYs (0.92 vs 0.91 average per patient); showing dominance. A position of dominance negates the need to calculate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSION: The nebulized 3% hypertonic solution was cost-effective in the inpatient treatment of infant bronchiolitis.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of sequential treatment with abaloparatide (ABL) followed by alendronate (ALN) [(ABL/ALN)] compared to ALN monotherapy and to sequential treatment starting with antiresorptive therapy (ALN/ABL/ALN). METHODS: A previously validated Markov microsimulation model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sequential ABL/ALN compared to ALN monotherapy and to sequential ALN/ABL/ALN from a lifetime US payer perspective. In line with practice guidelines, patients were assumed to receive ABL for 18 months followed by 5 years of ALN, or ALN monotherapy for 5 years, or a sequence of ALN for 2 years followed by 18 months of ABL and then by 3 years ALN.

25167,Cost-effectiveness of a novel smartphone application to mobilize first responders after witnessed OHCA in Belgium,"BACKGROUND: EVapp (Emergency Volunteer Application) is a Belgian smartphone application that mobilizes volunteers to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and defibrillation with publicly available automatic external defibrillators (AED) after an emergency call for suspected out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The aim is to bridge the time before the arrival of the emergency services. METHODS: An accessible model was developed, using literature data, to simulate survival and cost-effectiveness of nation-wide EVapp implementation. Initial validation was performed using field data from a first pilot study of EVapp implementation in a city in Flanders, covering 2.5 years of implementation. RESULTS: Simulation of nation-wide EVapp implementation resulted in an additional yearly 910 QALY gained over the current baseline case scenario (worst case 632; best case 3204). The cost per QALY associated with EVapp implementation was comparable to the baseline scenario, i.e., 17 vs 18 k€ QALY(-1). CONCLUSIONS: EVapp implementation was associated with a positive balance on amount of QALY gained and cost of QALY.

25168,"Five-Year Cost-Effectiveness Modeling of Primary Care-Based, Nonmydriatic Automated Retinal Image Analysis Screening Among Low-Income Patients with Diabetes","BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence-based technology systems offer an alternative solution for diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening compared with standard, in-office dilated eye examinations. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of Automated Retinal Image Analysis System (ARIAS)-based DR screening in a primary care medicine clinic that serves a low-income patient population. METHODS: A model-based, cost-effectiveness analysis of two DR screening systems was created utilizing data from a recent study comparing adherence rates to follow-up eye care among adults ages 18 or older with a clinical diagnosis of diabetes. In the study, the patients were prescreened with an ARIAS-based, nonmydriatic (undilated), point-of-care tool in the primary care setting and were compared with patients with diabetes who were referred for dilated retinal screening without prescreening, as is the current standard of care. Using a Markov model with microsimulation resulting in a total of 600 000 simulated patient experiences, we calculated the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of the two screening approaches, with regard to five-year cost-effectiveness of DR screening and treatment of vision-threatening DR. RESULTS: At five years, ARIAS-based screening showed similar utility as the standard of care screening systems. However, ARIAS reduced costs by 23.3%, with an ICUR of $258 721.81 comparing the current practice to ARIAS.

DESIGN: Parallel group randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 23 community and secondary care centres providing continence care in Scotland and England. PARTICIPANTS: 600 women aged 18 and older, newly presenting with stress or mixed urinary incontinence between February 2014 and July 2016: 300 were randomised to PFMT plus electromyographic biofeedback and 300 to PFMT alone. INTERVENTIONS: Participants in both groups were offered six appointments with a continence therapist over 16 weeks. Participants in the biofeedback PFMT group received supervised PFMT and a home PFMT programme, incorporating electromyographic biofeedback during clinic appointments and at home. The PFMT group received supervised PFMT and a home PFMT programme. PFMT programmes were progressed over the appointments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was self-reported severity of urinary incontinence (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-urinary incontinence short form (ICIQ-UI SF), range 0 to 21, higher scores indicating greater severity) at 24 months. Secondary outcomes were cure or improvement, other pelvic floor symptoms, condition specific quality of life, women''s perception of improvement, pelvic floor muscle function, uptake of other urinary incontinence treatment, PFMT self-efficacy, adherence, intervention costs, and quality adjusted life years. RESULTS: Mean ICIQ-UI SF scores at 24 months were 8.2 (SD 5.1, n=225) in the biofeedback PFMT group and 8.5 (SD 4.9, n=235) in the PFMT group (mean difference -0.09, 95% confidence interval -0.92 to 0.75, P=0.84). Biofeedback PFMT had similar costs (mean difference £121 ($154; €133), -£409 to £651, P=0.64) and quality adjusted life years (-0.04, -0.12 to 0.04, P=0.28) to PFMT. 48 participants reported an adverse event: for 23 this was related or possibly related to the interventions. CONCLUSIONS: At 24 months no evidence was found of any important difference in severity of urinary incontinence between PFMT plus electromyographic biofeedback and PFMT alone groups. Routine use of electromyographic biofeedback with PFMT should not be recommended. Other ways of maximising the effects of PFMT should be investigated.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the economic impact of dulaglutide, a weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist, on the treatment of diabetic patients as an alternative to both high dose sulphonylureas and insulin basalization at the failure of oral therapies alone. We carried out a cost-effectiveness analysis developed considering the economic implications of recent clinical studies regarding cardiovascular risk drug effects and especially of REWIND studies outcomes, focusing on the impact of weight changes on HRQoL. MATERIAL AND METHOD: In our analysis, we have applied the cost-utility technique to the above reported clinical outcomes and compared the global costs of dulaglutide versus sulfonylurea or basal insulin, all in add-on with metformin. We have chosen gliclazide, as a sulfonylurea and Abasaglar(®), the less expensive among basal insulin analogues. Abasaglar was titrated to 20 IU, corresponding to the mean dosage used in the treatment of type II diabetic patients. The model aims to estimate total direct costs related to the above-reported treatments and find out the real gap in costs between dulaglutide, the apparently cheaper gliclazide and basal insulin glargine (IGlargine) based on the Italian National Healthcare System (INHS). RESULTS: The total cost of dulaglutide has resulted in €859.66 higher than gliclazide (€1,579.73 vs €720.07) and basal insulin, although less significantly, reporting a difference of €396.54 (€1,579.73 vs 1,183.19). Except for the purchase cost, dulaglutide has reported reduced costs compared to insulin IGlargine and gliclazide. Dulaglutide showed lower self-monitoring blood glucose and hypoglycaemia costs, a significant reduction in costs related to cardiovascular complications, as well as savings in costs in other drugs. Dulaglutide can be considered a cost-effective antidiabetic therapy, due to the positive impact on the quality of life induced by weight reduction, despite the higher annual cost per patient, mainly influenced by drug purchase cost. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In this cost-utility analysis, dulaglutide has shown to be a cost-effective treatment option from the Italian healthcare system perspective as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. Study findings can provide stakeholders valuable evidence to support the adoption of this cost-effective second- or third-line therapy compared to gliclazide or basal insulin glargine.

25172,Cost utility analysis of continuous and intermittent versus intermittent vital signs monitoring in patients admitted to surgical wards,"Background: Complications after surgical procedures are common and can lead to a prolonged hospital stay, increased rates of postoperative hospital readmission, and increased mortality. Monitoring vital signs is an effective way to identify patients who are experiencing a deterioration in health. SensiumVitals is wireless system that includes a lightweight, digital patch that monitors vital signs at two minute intervals, and has shown promise in the early identification of patients at high risk of deterioration.Objective: To evaluate the cost-utility of continuous monitoring of vital signs with SensiumVitals in addition to intermittent monitoring compared to the usual care of patients admitted to surgical wards.Methods: A de novo decision analytic model, based on current treatment pathways, was developed to estimate the costs and outcomes. Results from randomised clinical trials and national standard sources were used to inform the model. Costs were estimated from the NHS and PSS perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted to explore uncertainty surrounding input parameters.Results: Over a 30-day time horizon, intermittent monitoring in addition to continuous monitoring of vital signs with SensiumVitals was less costly than intermittent vital signs monitoring alone. The total cost per patient was £6,329 versus £5,863 for the comparator and intervention groups respectively and the total effectiveness per patient was 0.057 QALYs in each group. Results from the PSA showed that use of SensiumVitals in addition to intermittent monitoring has 73% probability of being cost-effective at a £20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold and 73% probability of being cost-saving compared to the comparator. Cost savings were driven by reduced costs of hospital readmissions and length of stays in hospital.Conclusions: Use of SensiumVitals as a postoperative intervention for patients on surgical wards is a cost-saving and cost-effective strategy, yielding improvements in recovery with decreased health resource use.Key Points for Decision MakersSensiumVitals has the potential to reduce the length of postoperative hospital stay, readmission rates, and associated costs in postoperative patients.In this study, SensiumVitals has been found to be a cost-saving (dominant) and cost-effective (dominant) intervention for monitoring the vital signs of surgical patients postoperatively.",2020-01-35414,32212979,J Med Econ,Mehdi Javanbakht,2020,23 / 7,728-736,Yes,32212979,"Mehdi Javanbakht; Atefeh Mashayekhi; Miranda Trevor; Mohsen Rezaei Hemami; Candice L Downey; Michael Branagan-Harris; Jowan Atkinson; Cost utility analysis of continuous and intermittent versus intermittent vital signs monitoring in patients admitted to surgical wards, J Med Econ, 2020 Jul; 23(7):1369-6998; 728-736",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Medical Device",sensiumvitals continuous vital signs monitoring + intermittent vital signs monitoring vs. Standard/Usual Care- intermittent vital signs monitoring,"status post colorectal resections, stoma formations, stoma reversals, hernia repairs, or fistula exploration, readmission due to sepsis",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Month,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2018,Not Stated

Cost-effectiveness of different treat-to-target (T2T) strategies, especially ones including new treatments is important for development and preference policy for treatment centers. European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines are currently unclear about preference between a JAK1/JAK2 versus a biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD). OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this paper was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of baricitinib versus first biological for methotrexate inadequate responders in a T2T strategy using a Markov model that incorporates hospital costs as well as societal costs. Costs and utilities over five years were compared between the two strategies. METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to conduct cost-utility analysis from the societal perspective over 5 years. Health states were based on the DAS28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) categories. Effectiveness of baricitinib was retrieved from randomized controlled trials. Effectiveness of all other treatments, health state utilities, medical costs, and productivity loss were retrieved from the Dutch RhEumatoid Arthritis Monitoring (DREAM) cohorts. Annual discount rates of 1.5% for utility and 4% for costs were used. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to incorporate uncertainty and assess robustness of the results. RESULTS: Probabilistic sensitivity analysis results showed the baricitinib strategy yielded lower costs and higher utility over a 5-year period. Scenario analyses showed the baricitinib strategy to be cost-effective in both the moderate and severe RA populations. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that the use of a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor instead of a bDMARD in a T2T approach is cost-effective in csDMARD refractory RA patients.",2020-01-35424,32346301,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Celine J van de Laar,2020,12 /,213-222,No,32346301,"Celine J van de Laar; Martijn A H Oude Voshaar; Walid K H Fakhouri; Liliana Zaremba-Pechmann; Francesco De Leonardis; Inmaculada De La Torre; Mart A F J van de Laar; Cost-Effectiveness of a JAK1/JAK2 Inhibitor vs a Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug (bDMARD) in a Treat-to-Target Strategy for Rheumatoid Arthritis, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2020; 12():1178-6981; 213-222",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,csdmard --> increased dose --> baricitinib --> tapered dose with sustained remission vs. low-dose conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug --> high dose if remission is not achieved --> adalimumab if remission is not achieved --> a second biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug if remission is not achieved,"Dutch Rheumatoid Arthritis Monitoring registry cohorts, methotrexate inadequate responders",Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,4.00,1.50,-238275,Euro,2018,-290206.98
25174,Deceased donor kidney allocation: an economic evaluation of contemporary longevity matching practices,"BACKGROUND: Matching survival of a donor kidney with that of the recipient (longevity matching), is used in some kidney allocation systems to maximize graft-life years. It is not part of the allocation algorithm for Australia. Given the growing evidence of survival benefit due to longevity matching based allocation algorithms, development of a similar kidney allocation system for Australia is currently underway. The aim of this research is to estimate the impact that changes to costs and health outcomes arising from ''longevity matching'' on the Australian healthcare system. METHODS: A decision analytic model to estimate cost-effectiveness was developed using a Markov process. Four plausible competing allocation options were compared to the current kidney allocation practice.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the pre-trial cost-effectiveness of WBRT, hippocampal-avoidant WBRT (HA-WBRT), and observation (SRS or surgery alone) for this population to guide trial data collection efforts and reduce decision uncertainty. METHODS: A time-dependent Markov model followed patients treated with neurosurgery or SRS who received subsequent WBRT, HA-WBRT or observation over a 5-year time horizon. Model inputs were sourced from published literature and results tested for robustness using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Value of information (VOI) analysis was undertaken to guide data collection for the randomized trial. RESULTS: Over 5 years, the WBRT strategy produced 1.74 QALYs (2.38 life-years) at a mean cost of $40,128 (costs in 2017 Australian dollars); HA-WBRT produced 1.88 QALYs (2.38 life-years) and cost $42,977; and SRS/surgery alone produced 1.65 QALYs (2.13 life-years) at a cost of $46,281. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed HA-WBRT was the preferred strategy in 77% of simulations. Cost-effectiveness results were most sensitive to utilities of the controlled-disease health state in the WBRT group, and costs of HA-WBRT.

METHODS: Prospective study on 31 eyes from 31 patients (mean age: 72.1 ± 9.1 years; 55% females) was performed with a preoperative decision to undergo only pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) (26%) or PhacoPPV (74%) and/or posterior capsulotomy based upon presence or absence of lens opacification or pseudophakia. Time during and between surgeries, surgical procedure codes, medical and transport costs, outcome and likelihood of complications after surgery were all included in the analysis. Societal perspectives and visual acuity were considered as measures of quality of adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: About 23 eyes underwent triple procedure and eight eyes underwent vitrectomy only (mean surgery times: 35.9 and 24.0 min, respectively). Posterior capsulotomy took on average 30 s, while preparation and cataract procedure took 13.0 min. The patients travelled on average 80km (average cost: $280.12) to the surgery unit.

25183,"Assessment of harms, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: A micro-simulation study of 230 scenarios","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer screening incurs a high risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. An organized and age-targeted screening strategy may reduce the associated harms while retaining or enhancing the benefits. METHODS: Using a micro-simulation analysis (MISCAN) model, we assessed the harms, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of 230 prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies in a Dutch population. Screening strategies were varied by screening start age (50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55), stop age (51-69), and intervals (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and single test). Costs and effects of each screening strategy were compared with a no-screening scenario. RESULTS: The most optimum strategy would be screening with 3-year intervals at ages 55-64 resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €19 733 per QALY. This strategy predicted a 27% prostate cancer mortality reduction and 28 life years gained (LYG) per 1000 men; 36% of screen-detected men were overdiagnosed. Sensitivity analyses did not substantially alter the optimal screening strategy. CONCLUSIONS: PSA screening beyond age 64 is not cost-effective and associated with a higher risk of overdiagnosis.

METHODS: Using a micro-simulation analysis (MISCAN) model, we assessed the harms, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of 230 prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies in a Dutch population. Screening strategies were varied by screening start age (50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55), stop age (51-69), and intervals (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and single test). Costs and effects of each screening strategy were compared with a no-screening scenario. RESULTS: The most optimum strategy would be screening with 3-year intervals at ages 55-64 resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €19 733 per QALY. This strategy predicted a 27% prostate cancer mortality reduction and 28 life years gained (LYG) per 1000 men; 36% of screen-detected men were overdiagnosed. Sensitivity analyses did not substantially alter the optimal screening strategy. CONCLUSIONS: PSA screening beyond age 64 is not cost-effective and associated with a higher risk of overdiagnosis.

25198,"Assessment of harms, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening: A micro-simulation study of 230 scenarios","BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer screening incurs a high risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. An organized and age-targeted screening strategy may reduce the associated harms while retaining or enhancing the benefits. METHODS: Using a micro-simulation analysis (MISCAN) model, we assessed the harms, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of 230 prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening strategies in a Dutch population. Screening strategies were varied by screening start age (50, 51, 52, 53, 54, and 55), stop age (51-69), and intervals (1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and single test). Costs and effects of each screening strategy were compared with a no-screening scenario. RESULTS: The most optimum strategy would be screening with 3-year intervals at ages 55-64 resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €19 733 per QALY.
