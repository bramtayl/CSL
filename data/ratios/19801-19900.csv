19801,Estimating the Cost-Effectiveness of Lung Cancer Screening with Low-Dose Computed Tomography for High-Risk Smokers in Australia,"INTRODUCTION: Health economic evaluations of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) that are underpinned by clinical outcomes are relatively few. METHODS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of LDCT lung screening in Australia by applying Australian cost and survival data to the outcomes observed in the U.S. National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), in which a 20% lung cancer mortality benefit was demonstrated for three rounds of annual screening among high-risk smokers age 55 to 74 years. Screening-related costs were estimated from Medicare Benefits Schedule reimbursement rates (2015), lung cancer diagnosis and treatment costs from a 2012 Australian hospital-based study, lung cancer survival rates from the New South Wales Cancer Registry (2005-2009), and other-cause mortality from Australian life tables weighted by smoking status. The health utility outcomes, screening participation rates, and lung cancer rates were those observed in the NLST. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated for a 10-year time horizon. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of LDCT lung screening was estimated at AU$138,000 (80% confidence interval: AU$84,700-AU$353,000)/life-year gained and AU$233,000 (80% confidence interval: AU$128,000-AU$1,110,000)/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The ICER was more favorable when LDCT screening impact on all-cause mortality was considered, even when the costs of incidental findings were also estimated in sensitivity analyses: AU$157,000/QALY gained. This can be compared to an indicative willingness-to-pay threshold in Australia of AU$30,000 to AU$50,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: LDCT lung screening using NLST selection and implementation criteria is unlikely to be cost-effective in Australia. Future economic evaluations should consider alternative screening eligibility criteria, intervals, nodule management, the impact and cost of new therapies, investigations of incidental findings, and incorporation of smoking cessation interventions.",2018-01-27387,29689434,J Thorac Oncol,Stephen Wade,2018,13 / 8,1094-1105,No,29689434,"Stephen Wade; Marianne Weber; Michael Caruana; Yoon-Jung Kang; Henry Marshall; Renee Manser; Shalini Vinod; Nicole Rankin; Kwun Fong; Karen Canfell; Estimating the Cost-Effectiveness of Lung Cancer Screening with Low-Dose Computed Tomography for High-Risk Smokers in Australia, J Thorac Oncol, 2018 Aug; 13(8):1556-1380; 1094-1105",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Screening,Low-Dose Computed Tomography screening for lung cancer vs. None,"Smoking history of 30 or more pack-years and 15 years or less since quitting, current smokers",74 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,123000,Australia,2015,101025.36

19803,The cost-effectiveness of oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis and early antiretroviral therapy in the presence of drug resistance among men who have sex with men in San Francisco,"BACKGROUND: Poor adherence to either antiretroviral treatment (ART) or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can promote drug resistance, though this risk is thought to be considerably higher for ART. In the population of men who have sex with men (MSM) in San Francisco, PrEP coverage reached 9.6% in 2014 and has continued to rise. Given the risk of drug resistance and high cost of second-line drugs, the costs and benefits of initiating ART earlier while expanding PrEP coverage remain unclear. METHODS: We develop an infection-age-structured mathematical model and fit this model to the annual incidence of AIDS cases and deaths directly, and to resistance and demographic data indirectly. We investigate the impact of six various intervention scenarios (low, medium, or high PrEP coverage, with or without earlier ART) over the next 20 years. RESULTS: Low (medium, high) PrEP coverage with earlier ART could prevent 22% (42%, 57%) of a projected 44,508 total new infections and 8% (26%, 41%) of a projected 18,426 new drug-resistant infections, and result in a gain of 43,649 (74,048, 103,270) QALYs over 20 years compared to the status quo, at a cost of $4745 ($78,811, $115,320) per QALY gained, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High PrEP coverage with earlier ART is expected to provide the greatest benefit but also entail the highest costs among the strategies considered. This strategy is cost-effective for the San Francisco MSM population, even considering the acquisition and transmission of ART-mediated drug resistance. However, without a substantial increase to San Francisco''s annual HIV budget, the most advisable strategy may be initiating ART earlier, while maintaining current strategies of PrEP enrollment.",2018-01-27389,29688862,BMC Med,Mingwang Shen,2018,16 / 1,58,No,29688862,"Mingwang Shen; Yanni Xiao; Libin Rong; Lauren Ancel Meyers; Steven E Bellan; The cost-effectiveness of oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis and early antiretroviral therapy in the presence of drug resistance among men who have sex with men in San Francisco, BMC Med, 2018 Jan 30; 16(1):1741-7015; 58",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Medium oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) coverage vs. Low pre-exposure prophylaxis coverage: 25% during 20 years,Men who have sex with men,65 Years,18 Years,Male,Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,117130,United States,2017,123672.21

19808,Cost-effectiveness of a New Opportunistic Screening Strategy for Walk-in Fingertip HbA1c Testing at Community Pharmacies in Japan,"OBJECTIVE: A new opportunistic community-based strategy was launched in Japan in April 2014 to detect lifestyle-related diseases, including diabetes, by creating Specimen Measurement Offices (SMOs). SMOs offer walk-in fingertip HbA1c testing. This article aimed to assess the value-for-money of HbA1c testing services at SMOs by conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared two scenarios: 1) status quo, defined as HbA1c testing that is available only through conventional screening, and 2) HbA1c testing available at SMOs as a complement to the status quo scenario. The model consisted of a screening module with a decision tree and a disease progression module with a Markov model. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., cost per quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) over the lifetime analytic horizon as the primary end point of the cost-effectiveness analysis. In this model, we assumed the participant cohort to be people 40-74 years of age who sought walk-in fingertip HbA1c testing at SMOs on the premises of community pharmacies. Costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3%. The cost-effectiveness was analyzed from a societal perspective. RESULTS: The incremental cost per individual for those 40-74 years of age was estimated to be -527 U.S. dollars (USD) (-52,722 Japanese yen [JPY]) for HbA1c testing at SMOs compared with the status quo. Incremental effectiveness was estimated to be 0.0203 QALYs for HbA1c testing at SMOs compared with the status quo. Therefore, this cost-effectiveness analysis showed that compared with the status quo, HbA1c testing at SMOs was more effective and had lower cost for the population studied. CONCLUSIONS: We consider our results to be robust because most simulations were under the threshold of USD 50,000 (JPY 5,000,000) per QALYs gained, by sensitivity analysis.

SMOs offer walk-in fingertip HbA1c testing. This article aimed to assess the value-for-money of HbA1c testing services at SMOs by conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared two scenarios: 1) status quo, defined as HbA1c testing that is available only through conventional screening, and 2) HbA1c testing available at SMOs as a complement to the status quo scenario. The model consisted of a screening module with a decision tree and a disease progression module with a Markov model. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., cost per quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) over the lifetime analytic horizon as the primary end point of the cost-effectiveness analysis. In this model, we assumed the participant cohort to be people 40-74 years of age who sought walk-in fingertip HbA1c testing at SMOs on the premises of community pharmacies. Costs and outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3%. The cost-effectiveness was analyzed from a societal perspective. RESULTS: The incremental cost per individual for those 40-74 years of age was estimated to be -527 U.S. dollars (USD) (-52,722 Japanese yen [JPY]) for HbA1c testing at SMOs compared with the status quo.

19816,Economic Analysis of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Versus Primary Debulking Surgery for Advanced Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Using an Aggressive Surgical Paradigm,"OBJECTIVES: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus primary debulking surgery (PDS) for advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (AEOC) remains controversial in the United States. Generalizability of existing trial results has been criticized because of less aggressive debulking procedures than commonly used in the United States. As a result, economic evaluations using input data from these trials may not accurately reflect costs and outcomes associated with more aggressive primary surgery. Using data from an ongoing trial performing aggressive debulking, we investigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of NACT versus PDS for AEOC. METHODS: A decision tree model was constructed to estimate differences in short-term outcomes and costs for a hypothetical cohort of 15,000 AEOC patients (US annual incidence of AEOC) treated with NACT versus PDS over a 1-year time horizon from a Medicare payer perspective. Outcomes included costs per cancer-related death averted, life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Base-case probabilities, costs, and utilities were based on the Surgical Complications Related to Primary or Interval Debulking in Ovarian Neoplasms trial. Base-case analyses assumed equivalent survival; threshold analysis estimated the maximum survival difference that would result in NACT being cost-effective at $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to characterize model uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared with PDS, NACT was associated with $142 million in cost savings, 1098 fewer cancer-related deaths, and 1355 life-years and 1715 QALYs gained, making it the dominant treatment strategy for all outcomes. In sensitivity analysis, NACT remained dominant in 99.3% of simulations. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy remained cost-effective at $50,000/QALY and $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay thresholds if survival differences were less than 2.7 and 1.4 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In the short term, NACT is cost-saving with improved outcomes. However, if PDS provides a longer-term survival advantage, it may be cost-effective.

19817,Cost-Effectiveness of Take-Home Naloxone for the Prevention of Overdose Fatalities among Heroin Users in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Heroin overdose is a major cause of premature death. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that is effective for the reversal of heroin overdose in emergency situations and can be used by nonmedical responders. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of distributing naloxone to adults at risk of heroin overdose for use by nonmedical responders compared with no naloxone distribution in a European healthcare setting (United Kingdom). METHODS: A Markov model with an integrated decision tree was developed based on an existing model, using UK data where available. We evaluated an intramuscular naloxone distribution reaching 30% of heroin users. Costs and effects were evaluated over a lifetime and discounted at 3.5%. The results were assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The model estimated that distribution of intramuscular naloxone, would decrease overdose deaths by around 6.6%. In a population of 200,000 heroin users this equates to the prevention of 2,500 premature deaths at an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of pound899. The sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSIONS: Our evaluation suggests that the distribution of take-home naloxone decreased overdose deaths by around 6.6% and was cost-effective with an incremental cost per QALY gained well below a pound20,000 willingness-to-pay threshold set by UK decision-makers. The model code has been made available to aid future research.

19818,Cost-effectiveness analysis of oral probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea in children and adolescents,"BACKGROUND: The incidence of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in hospitalized children and adolescents has been increasing year-on-year. Paediatric CDAD places a significant economic burden on healthcare systems. Probiotics are live organisms thought to improve the microbial balance of the host, counteract disturbances in intestinal flora, and reduce the risk of colonization by pathogenic bacteria. AIM: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to assess the economy of probiotics for the prevention of CDAD in children and adolescents receiving antibiotics. METHODS: A decision tree model combining clinical effectiveness, utility and cost data was used. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the robustness of the model outcomes. FINDING: The ''oral probiotics'' strategy and ''no probiotics'' strategy offered patients 0.05876 and 0.056 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at a cost of $16,668.70 and $20,355.28, respectively. The oral probiotics strategy exhibited higher QALY and lower cost, and represents the cost-saving strategy. The results were robust for sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: From the perspective of the medical system, oral probiotics as a preventive strategy for CDAD in hospitalized children and adolescents receiving a therapeutic course of antibiotics reduced the risk of CDAD and represents a cost-saving strategy.",2018-01-27416,29678466,J Hosp Infect,N Li,2018,99 / 4,469-474,No,29678466,"N Li; B Zheng; H-F Cai; Y-H Chen; M-Q Qiu; M-B Liu; Cost-effectiveness analysis of oral probiotics for the prevention of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea in children and adolescents, J Hosp Infect, 2018 Aug; 99(4):0195-6701; 469-474",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Other,Oral probiotics vs. Standard/Usual Care- No probiotics,Hospitalized; receiving therapeutic antibiotics,17 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1335717.39,United States,2018,-1376697.4
19819,A health economic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of OPTIFAST for the treatment of obesity in the United States,"OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with high direct medical costs and indirect costs resulting from productivity loss. The high prevalence of obesity generates a justified need to identify cost-effective weight loss approaches from a payer''s perspective. Within the variety of weight management techniques, OPTIFAST is a clinically recognized and scientifically proven total meal replacement Low Calorie Diet that provides meaningful results in terms of weight loss and reduction in comorbidities. The objective of this study is assess potential cost-savings of the OPTIFAST program in the US, as compared to ""no intervention"" and pharmacotherapy. METHODS: An event-driven decision analytic model was used to estimate payer''s cost-savings from reimbursement of the 1-year OPTIFAST program over 3 years in the US. The analysis was performed for the broad population of obese persons (BMI >30 kg/m(2)) undergoing the OPTIFAST program vs liraglutide 3 mg, naltrexone/bupropion and vs ""no intervention"". The model included the risk of complications related to increased BMI. Data sources included published literature, clinical trials, official US price/tariff lists, and national population statistics. The primary perspective was that of a US payer; costs were provided in 2016 US dollars. RESULTS: OPTIFAST leads over a period of 3 years to cost-savings of USD 9,285 per class I and II obese patient (BMI 30-39.9 kg/m(2)) as compared to liraglutide and USD 685 as compared to naltrexone/bupropion. In the same time perspective, the OPTIFAST program leads to a reduction of cost of obesity complications of USD 1,951 as compared to ""no intervention"", with the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of USD 6,475 per QALY. Scenario analyses also show substantial cost-savings in patients with class III obesity (BMI >/= 40.0 kg/m(2)) and patients with obesity (BMI = 30-39.9 kg/m(2)) and type 2 diabetes vs all three previous comparators and bariatric surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Reimbursing OPTIFAST leads to meaningful cost-savings for US payers as compared with ""no intervention"" and liraglutide and naltrexone/bupropion in obese patients. Similar results can be expected in matching healthcare settings of other countries.

19822,Amaze: a randomized controlled trial of adjunct surgery for atrial fibrillation,"OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation (AF) reduces survival and quality of life (QoL). It can be treated at the time of major cardiac surgery using ablation procedures ranging from simple pulmonary vein isolation to a full maze procedure. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of adjunct AF surgery as currently performed on sinus rhythm (SR) restoration, survival, QoL and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: In a multicentre, Phase III, pragmatic, double-blinded, parallel-armed randomized controlled trial, 352 cardiac surgery patients with >3 months of documented AF were randomized to surgery with or without adjunct maze or similar AF ablation between 2009 and 2014. Primary outcomes were SR restoration at 1 year and quality-adjusted life years at 2 years. Secondary outcomes included SR at 2 years, overall and stroke-free survival, medication, QoL, cost-effectiveness and safety. RESULTS: More ablation patients were in SR at 1 year [odds ratio (OR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-3.54; P = 0.009]. At 2 years, the OR increased to 3.24 (95% CI 1.76-5.96). Quality-adjusted life years were similar at 2 years (ablation - control -0.025, P = 0.6319). Significantly fewer ablation patients were anticoagulated from 6 months postoperatively. Stroke rates were 5.7% (ablation) and 9.1% (control) (P = 0.3083). There was no significant difference in stroke-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.99, 95% CI 0.64-1.53; P = 0.949] nor in serious adverse events, operative or overall survival, cardioversion, pacemaker implantation, New York Heart Association, EQ-5D-3L and SF-36. The mean additional ablation cost per patient was pound3533 (95% CI pound1321- pound5746). Cost-effectiveness was not demonstrated at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunct AF surgery is safe and increases SR restoration and costs but not survival or QoL up to 2 years. A continued follow-up will provide information on these outcomes in the longer term.

19823,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a fixed-dose combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium as maintenance treatment for COPD,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA)/long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) dual bronchodilator indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) as a maintenance treatment for COPD patients from the perspective of health care payer in Taiwan. Patients and methods: We adopted a patient-level simulation model, which included a cohort of COPD patients aged >/=40 years. The intervention used in the study was the treatment using IND/GLY, and comparators were tiotropium or salmeterol/fluticasone combination (SFC). Data related to the efficacy of drugs, incidence of exacerbation, and utility were obtained from clinical studies. Direct costs were estimated from claims data based on the severity of COPD. The cycle length was 6 months (to match forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV1] data), and the time horizons included 1, 3, 5, 10 years, and lifetime. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model results. Costs were expressed in US dollars with a discount rate of 3.0%. Results: Compared to tiotropium and SFC, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of patients treated with IND/GLY were US$5,987 and US$14,990, respectively. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the improvement in FEV1 provided by IND/GLY, the distribution of patients with regard to the severity of COPD, and acute exacerbation rate ratio were the key drivers behind cost-effectiveness. Adopting a willingness to pay of US$60,000 per QALY gained as the threshold, there was a 98.7% probability that IND/GLY was cost-effective compared to tiotropium. Similarly, there was a 99.9% probability that IND/GLY was cost-effective compared to SFC.

Parameters of the effectiveness of surgery and complications were informed by data from the UK National Bariatric Surgery Registry, the Scandinavian Obesity Registry and the Swedish Obese Subjects study.

19867,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Crohn's Disease Treatment with Vedolizumab and Ustekinumab After Failure of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha Antagonist,"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Crohn''s disease (CD) treatment with vedolizumab and ustekinumab after failure of therapy with tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonists (anti-TNFs). METHODS: The Markov model incorporated the lifetime horizon, synthesis-based estimates of biologics'' efficacy in relation to anti-TNF exposure, and administration of biologics reflecting clinical practice (e.g., sequence of biologics, retreatment, 12-month treatment). The utilities, non-medical costs and indirect costs were derived from a study of 200 adult patients with CD, while the healthcare costs were from a study of 1393 adults with CD who used biologics in Poland. The quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs (the societal perspective) were discounted with the annual rates of 3.5 and 5%, respectively. RESULTS: The addition of vedolizumab (ustekinumab) to the sequence of available anti-TNFs (after first-line infliximab or after second-line adalimumab) led to a gain of 0.364 (0.349) QALYs at an additional cost of euro5600.24 (euro6593.82). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were euro15,369 [95% confidence interval (CI) 7496-61,354] and euro18,878 (95% CI 9213-85,045) per QALY gained with vedolizumab and ustekinumab, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed a high impact on the ICERs of the relapse rate after discontinuation of biologic treatment. The highest value of vedolizumab/ustekinumab was estimated after the failure of therapies with both anti-TNFs.

19870,Projected effectiveness and added value of HIV vaccination campaigns in South Africa: A modeling study,"Promising multi-dose HIV vaccine regimens are being tested in trials in South Africa. We estimated the potential epidemiological and economic impact of HIV vaccine campaigns compared to continuous vaccination, assuming that vaccine efficacy is transient and dependent on immune response. We used a dynamic economic mathematical model of HIV transmission calibrated to 2012 epidemiological data to simulate vaccination with anticipated antiretroviral treatment scale-up in South Africa. We estimate that biennial vaccination with a 70% efficacious vaccine reaching 20% of the sexually active population could prevent 480,000-650,000 HIV infections (13.8-15.3% of all infections) over 10 years. Assuming a launch price of $15 per dose, vaccination was found to be cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $13,746 per quality-adjusted life-year as compared to no vaccination. Increasing vaccination coverage to 50% will prevent more infections but is less likely to achieve cost-effectiveness. Campaign vaccination is consistently more effective and costs less than continuous vaccination across scenarios.

Materials and Methods Cost-utility analysis was performed parallel to a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial in Dutch general practice. A total of 356 patients with traumatic knee symptoms were included from November 2012 to December 2015 (mean age, 33 years +/- 8 [standard deviation]; 222 men [62%]). Patients were randomly assigned to usual care (n = 177; MR imaging was not performed, but patients were referred to an orthopedic surgeon when conservative treatment was unsatisfactory) or MR imaging (n = 179) within 2 weeks after injury. Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs from a healthcare and societal perspective. Multiple imputation was used for missing data. The Student t test was used to assess differences in mean QALYs, costs, and net benefits. Results Mean QALYs were 0.888 in the MR imaging group and 0.899 in the usual care group (P = .255). Healthcare costs per patient were higher in the MR imaging group (euro1109) than in the usual care group (euro837) (P = .050), mainly due to higher costs for MR imaging, with no reduction in the number of referrals to an orthopedic surgeon in the MR imaging group.

This combined with improved harm reduction interventions may lead to HCV elimination especially in people who inject drugs (PWID). We assessed the effectiveness/cost-effectiveness of improvements in harm reduction and chronic hepatitis C (CHC) care cascade in PWID in France. We used a dynamic model of HCV transmission and CHC natural history and evaluated the following: improved needle/syringe programmes-opioid substitution therapies, faster diagnosis/linkage to care, earlier treatment initiation, alone and in combination among active PWID (mean age = 36). Outcomes were as follows: life expectancy in discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); direct lifetime discounted costs; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER); number of infections/reinfections. Under the current practice, life expectancy was 15.846 QALYs, for a mean lifetime cost of euro20 762. Treatment initiation at F0 fibrosis stage alone was less effective and more costly than faster diagnosis/linkage to care combined with treatment initiation at F0, which increased life expectancy to 16.694 QALYs, decreased new infections by 37%, with a ICER = euro5300/QALY.

19879,OPTIMAL and ENSURE trials-based combined cost-effectiveness analysis of erlotinib versus chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of Asian patients with non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Erlotinib, the first generation of epidermoid growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI), has been recommended as an essential treatment in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutation. Although it has improved progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) was limited and erlotinib can be expensive. This cost-effectiveness analysis compares erlotinib monotherapy with gemcitabine-included doublet chemotherapy. SETTING: First-line treatment of Asian patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutation. METHODS: A Markov model was created based on the results of the ENSURE (NCT01342965) and OPTIMAL (CTONG-0802) trials which evaluated erlotinib and chemotherapy. The model simulates cancer progression and all causes of death. All medical costs were calculated from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes are costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: The combined PFS was 11.81 months and 5.1 months for erlotinib and chemotherapy, respectively, while the OS was reversed at 24.68 months for erlotinib and 26.16 months for chemotherapy. The chemotherapy arm gained 0.13 QALYs compared with erlotinib monotherapy (1.17 QALYs vs 1.04 QALYs), while erlotinib had lower costs ($55 230 vs $77 669), resulting in an ICER of $174 808 per QALY for the chemotherapy arm, which exceeds three times the Chinese GDP per capita. The most influential factors were the health utility of PFS, the cost of erlotinib and the health utility of progressed disease. CONCLUSION: Erlotinib monotherapy may be acceptable as a cost-effective first-line treatment for NSCLC compared with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. The results were robust to changes in assumptions.

METHODS: A microsimulation Markov model was constructed to compare 3 strategies for middle-aged patients with symptomatic type II SLAP tears: SLAP repair, biceps tenodesis, or nonoperative management. A failed 6-month trial of nonoperative treatment was assumed. The principal outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in 2017 U.S. dollars using a societal perspective over a 10-year time horizon. Treatment effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). Model results were compared with estimates from the published literature and were subjected to sensitivity analyses to evaluate robustness. RESULTS: Primary biceps tenodesis compared with SLAP repair conferred an increased effectiveness of 0.06 QALY with cost savings of $1,766. Compared with nonoperative treatment, both biceps tenodesis and SLAP repair were cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio values of $3,344/QALY gained and $4,289/QALY gained, respectively).

19884,Switching from sitagliptin to liraglutide to manage patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK: A long-term cost-effectiveness analysis,"AIMS: The recent LIRA-SWITCH trial showed that switching from sitagliptin 100 mg to liraglutide 1.8 mg led to statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1C) and body mass index (BMI). Based on these findings, the aim of the present study was to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of switching from sitagliptin to liraglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model Version 8.5+ was used to project costs and clinical outcomes over patients'' lifetimes. Baseline cohort characteristics and treatment effects were derived from the LIRA-SWITCH trial. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. Costs were accounted in pounds sterling (GBP) and expressed in 2016 values. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Model projections showed improved quality-adjusted life expectancy for patients with poorly controlled HbA1c upon switching from sitagliptin to liraglutide, compared with continuing sitagliptin treatment (9.18 vs 9.02 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]). Treatment switching was associated with increased overall costs (GBP 24737 vs GBP 22362). Higher pharmacy costs were partially offset by reduced diabetes-related complication costs in patients who switched to liraglutide. Switching to liraglutide was associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 15423 per QALY gained vs continuing with sitagliptin treatment.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the Multiple Daily Injections and Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Diabetes (DIAMOND) trial, 158 patients with T1D and HbA1c >/=7.5% were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to CGM or control. Participants were surveyed at baseline and 6 months. Within-trial and lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses were conducted. A modified Sheffield T1D policy model was used to simulate T1D complications. The main outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Within the 6-month trial, the CGM group had similar QALYs to the control group (0.462 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.455 +/- 0.06 years, P = 0.61). The total 6-month costs were $11,032 (CGM) vs. $7,236 (control).

Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of cGRS testing to inform clinical decision making about statin initiation in individuals with low-to-intermediate (2.5%-7.5%) 10-year predicted risk of ASCVD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of testing for a 27-single-nucleotide polymorphism cGRS comparing 4 test/treat strategies: treat all, treat none, test/treat if cGRS is high, and test/treat if cGRS is intermediate or high. We tested a set of clinical scenarios of men and women, aged 45 to 65 years, with 10-year ASCVD risks between 2.5% and 7.5%. Our primary outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Under base case assumptions for statin disutility and cost, the preferred strategy is to treat all patients with ASCVD risk >2.5% without cGRS testing. For certain clinical scenarios, such as a 57-year-old man with a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5%, cGRS testing can be cost-effective under a limited set of assumptions; for example, when statins cost $15 per month and statin disutility is 0.013 (ie, willing to trade 3 months of life in perfect health to avoid 20 years of statin therapy), the preferred strategy (using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained) is to test and treat if cGRS is intermediate or high. Overall, the results were not sensitive to assumptions about statin efficacy and harms.

Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of cGRS testing to inform clinical decision making about statin initiation in individuals with low-to-intermediate (2.5%-7.5%) 10-year predicted risk of ASCVD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of testing for a 27-single-nucleotide polymorphism cGRS comparing 4 test/treat strategies: treat all, treat none, test/treat if cGRS is high, and test/treat if cGRS is intermediate or high.

The trial was designed to test a complex intervention aimed at improving vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) rates through increasing women''s involvement in their care. Prior to developing a robust standardised model to conduct the health economic analysis, an analysis of a hypothetical cohort was performed to estimate the costs and health effects of VBAC compared to elective repeat caesarean delivery (ERCD) for low-risk women in four European countries. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the costs and the health effects, measured using Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), of VBAC compared with ERCD. A cost-effectiveness analysis for the period from confirmation of pregnancy to 6 weeks postpartum was performed for short-term consequences and during lifetime for long-term consequences, based on a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 pregnant women in each of four different countries; Belgium, Germany, Ireland and Italy. A societal perspective was adopted. Where possible, transition probabilities, costs and health effects were adapted from national data obtained from the respective countries. Country-specific thresholds were used to determine the cost-effectiveness of VBAC compared to ERCD. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the uncertainty of model assumptions. RESULTS: Within a 6-week time horizon, VBAC resulted in a reduction in costs, ranging from euro3,334,052 (Germany) to euro66,162,379 (Ireland), and gains in QALYs ranging from 6399 (Italy) to 7561 (Germany) per 100,000 women birthing in each country. Compared to ERCD, VBAC is the dominant strategy in all four countries. Applying a lifetime horizon, VBAC is dominant compared to ERCD in all countries except for Germany (probabilistic analysis, ICER: euro8609/QALY). In conclusion, compared to ERCD, VBAC remains cost-effective when using a lifetime time. CONCLUSIONS: In all four countries, VBAC was cost-effective compared to ERCD for low-risk women.

19898,The Seven-Year Cost-Effectiveness of Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion Versus Cervical Disc Arthroplasty: A Markov Analysis,"STUDY DESIGN: Markov model analysis. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the 7-year cost-effectiveness of single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) versus cervical disc replacement (CDR) for the treatment of cervical disc degeneration. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Both ACDF and CDR are acceptable surgical options for the treatment of symptomatic cervical disc degeneration. Past studies have demonstrated at least equal effectiveness of CDR when compared with ACDF in large randomized Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) studies. Short-term cost-effectiveness analyses at 5 years have suggested that CDR may be the preferred treatment option. However, adjacent segment disease and other postoperative complications may occur after 5 years following surgery. METHODS: A Markov model analysis was used to evaluate data from the LDR Mobi-C IDE study, incorporating five Markov transition states and seven cycles with each cycle set to a length of 1 year. Transition state probabilities were determined from complication rates, as well as index and adjacent segment reoperation rates from the IDE study. Raw SF-12 data were converted to health state utility values using the SF-6D algorithm for 174 CDR patients and 79 ACDF patients. RESULTS: Assuming an ideal operative candidate who is 40-years-old and failed appropriate conservative care, the 7-year cost was $103,924 for ACDF and $105,637 for CDR. CDR resulted in the generation of 5.33 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), while ACDF generated 5.16 QALYs. Both ACDF and CDR were cost-effective, but the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $10,076/QALY in favor of CDR, which was less than the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: ACDF and CDR are both cost-effective strategies for the treatment of cervical disc degeneration. However, CDR is the more cost-effective procedure at 7 years following surgery. Further long-term studies are needed to validate the findings of this model.

19899,Clinical Effect and Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis: A Markov Model,"OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of screening depends on the cost of screening, prevalence of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS), and the potential effect of medical intervention in reducing the risk of stroke. The aim of the study was to determine the threshold values for these parameters in order for screening for ACAS to be cost-effective. METHODS: The clinical effect and cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening for ACAS with subsequent initiation of preventive therapy versus not screening was assessed in a Markov model with a lifetime perspective. Key parameters, including stroke risk, all cause mortality, and costs, were based on contemporary published data, population statistics, and data from an ongoing screening program in Uppsala county (population 300,000), Sweden. Prevalence of ACAS (2%) and the rate of best medical treatment (BMT; 40%) were based on data from a male Swedish population recently screened for ACAS. The required stroke risk reduction from BMT, incremental cost-efficiency ratio (ICER), absolute risk reduction for stroke (ARR), and number needed to screen (NNS) were calculated. RESULTS: Screening was cost-effective at an ICER of euro5744 per incremental quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. ARR was 135 per 100,000 screened, NNS was 741, and QALYs gained were 6700 per 100,000 invited. At a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of euro50,000 per QALY the minimum required stroke risk reduction from BMT was 22%. The assumed degree of stroke risk reduction was the most important determinant of cost-efficiency. CONCLUSION: A moderate (22%) reduction in the risk of stroke was required for an ACAS screening strategy to be cost-effective at a WTP of euro50,000/QALY. Targeting populations with a higher prevalence of ACAS could further improve cost-efficiency.",2018-01-27511,29636252,Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg,Dominika Hogberg,2018,55 / 6,819-827,No,29636252,"Dominika Hogberg; Kevin Mani; Anders Wanhainen; Sverker Svensjo; Clinical Effect and Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis: A Markov Model, Eur J Vasc Endovasc Surg, 2018 Jun; 55(6):1078-5884; 819-827",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Screening,Screening Strategy for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis vs. Standard/Usual Care- No Screening Strategy,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,5744,Euro,2016,6854.07
19900,A cost-utility analysis of artificial urinary sphincter versus AdVance male sling in post prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence: A publicly funded health care perspective,"AIMS: To investigate the long-term cost-utility of the artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) compared with Transobturator Retroluminal Sling (AdVance) in the treatment of patients with severe post prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence (PPSUI) from a Canadian provincial health perspective. METHODS: A Markov model with Monte Carlo simulation was developed with a cycle length of 1 year and time horizon up to 10 years to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Patients were assigned to treatment with either AUS or an AdVance sling. Transition probabilities, efficacy data, and utility indices were derived from published literature and expert opinion. Cost data were obtained from provincial health care system and hospital data in 2016-Canadian dollars. The primary outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life year. A standard discount rate of 1.5% was applied annually. Probabilistic and one way deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: AUS implantation had a 10-year mean total cost of $14 228 (SD +/- 3,509) for 7.58 QALYs. AdVance sling had a mean total cost $18 938 (SD +/- 12,435) for 6.43 QALYs. The incremental cost savings of AUS over 10-years was -$ 4710 with an added effectiveness of 1.15 QALYs. At a willingness to pay threshold of $50 000, AUS remained the most cost-effective option. A limitation of our analysis is the lack of direct long-term comparisons between both scenarios along with standard success definition. CONCLUSIONS: AUS implantation appears to be more economical treatment strategy for severe PPSUI compared with AdVance sling for a publicly funded health care system over a 5- and 10-year time horizon.",2018-01-27514,29635704,Neurourol Urodyn,Samer Shamout,2018,37 / 7,2195-2203,No,29635704,"Samer Shamout; Sara Nazha; Alice Dragomir; Lysanne Campeau; A cost-utility analysis of artificial urinary sphincter versus AdVance male sling in post prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence: A publicly funded health care perspective, Neurourol Urodyn, 2018 Sep; 37(7):0733-2467; 2195-2203",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Medical Procedure, Surgical",ArtificIal Urinary Sphincter vs. AdVance Male Sling; Transobturator Retroluminal Sling,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,1.50,1.50,-4095.65,Canada,2016,-3338.06
