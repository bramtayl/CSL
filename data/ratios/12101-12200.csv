12101,Cataract surgery cost utility revisited in 2012: a new economic paradigm,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the 2012 cost utility of cataract surgery in the United States and to compare 2012 cost-utility data with those from 2000. DESIGN: Value-Based Medicine (Flourtown, PA), patient preference-based, comparative effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis using 2012 real United States dollars. PARTICIPANTS: Previously published Patient Outcomes Research Team Study data and time tradeoff utilities obtained from patients with vision loss. Visual acuity measurements from patients wtih untreated cataract were used as controls. INTERVENTION: Thirteen-year, average, first-eye and second-eye cataract surgery cost-utility analysis using the societal and third-party insurer cost perspectives. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient value gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and percent gain in quality of life as well as the cost-utility ratio using the dollars expended per QALY gained. Patient and financial value outcomes were discounted at 3% annually with net present value analysis. RESULTS: First-eye cataract surgery conferred 1.6212 QALYs over the 13-year model, a 20.8% quality-of-life gain. Bilateral cataract surgery conferred 2.8152 QALYs over 13 years, a 36.2% improvement in quality of life. The direct ophthalmic medical cost for unilateral cataract surgery in 2012 United States nominal dollars was $2653, an inflation-adjusted 34.2% less than in 2000 and 85% less than in 1985. The 2012 inflation-adjusted physician fee was 10.1% of that in 1985. The 13-year societal cost perspective, financial return on investment (ROI) for first-eye cataract surgery was $121,198, a 4567% gain. The third-party insurer cost perspective average cost-utility ratio was $2653/1.6212 = $1636/QALY for unilateral cataract surgery, whereas the societal cost perspective average cost-utility ratio was -$121,198/1.6212 = -$74,759/QALY. The net 13-year $123.4-billion financial ROI from a 1-year cohort of cataract surgery patients was accrued: Medicare, $36.4 billion; Medicaid, $3.3 billion; other insurers, $9.6 billion; patients, $48.6 billion; and increased United States national productivity, $25.4 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Cataract surgery in 2012 greatly improved quality of life and was highly cost effective. It was 34.4% less expensive than in 2000 and 85% less expensive than in 1985.

12103,The societal and economic value of rotator cuff repair,"BACKGROUND: Although rotator cuff disease is a common musculoskeletal problem in the United States, the impact of this condition on earnings, missed workdays, and disability payments is largely unknown. This study examines the value of surgical treatment for full-thickness rotator cuff tears from a societal perspective. METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed to estimate lifetime direct and indirect costs associated with surgical and continued nonoperative treatment for symptomatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears. All patients were assumed to have been unresponsive to one six-week trial of nonoperative treatment prior to entering the model. Model assumptions were obtained from the literature and data analysis. We obtained estimates of indirect costs using national survey data and patient-reported outcomes. Four indirect costs were modeled: probability of employment, household income, missed workdays, and disability payments. Direct cost estimates were based on average Medicare reimbursements with adjustments to an all-payer population. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The age-weighted mean total societal savings from rotator cuff repair compared with nonoperative treatment was $13,771 over a patient''s lifetime. Savings ranged from $77,662 for patients who are thirty to thirty-nine years old to a net cost to society of $11,997 for those who are seventy to seventy-nine years old. In addition, surgical treatment results in an average improvement of 0.62 QALY. Societal savings were highly sensitive to age, with savings being positive at the age of sixty-one years and younger. The estimated lifetime societal savings of the approximately 250,000 rotator cuff repairs performed in the U.S. each year was $3.44 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Rotator cuff repair for full-thickness tears produces net societal cost savings for patients under the age of sixty-one years and greater QALYs for all patients. Rotator cuff repair is cost-effective for all populations. The results of this study should not be interpreted as suggesting that all rotator cuff tears require surgery. Rather, the results show that rotator cuff repair has an important role in minimizing the societal burden of rotator cuff disease.",2013-01-14724,24257656,J Bone Joint Surg Am,Richard C 3rd Mather,2013,95 / 22,1993-2000,No,24257656,"Richard C 3rd Mather; Lane Koenig; Daniel Acevedo; Timothy M Dall; Paul Gallo; Anthony Romeo; John Tongue; Gerald Jr Williams; The societal and economic value of rotator cuff repair, J Bone Joint Surg Am, ; 95(22):0021-9355; 1993-2000",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Open or arthroscopic rotator cuff repair vs. Nonoperative treatment,Not Stated,79 Years,30 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-22211.29,United States,2013,-24676.34
12104,Personalised treatment using serum drug levels of adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: an evaluation of costs and effects,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of personalised treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using clinical response and serum adalimumab levels. METHODS: A personalised treatment algorithm defined, based on clinical (European League Against Rheumatism) response and drug levels at 6 months, whether adalimumab treatment should be continued in a specific dose or discontinued and/or switched to a next biological. Outcomes were simulated using a patient level Markov model, with 3 months cycles, based on a cohort of 272 adalimumab-treated patients with RA for 3 years and data of patients from the Utrecht Rheumatoid Arthritis Cohort. Costs, clinical effectiveness and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) were compared with outcomes as observed in usual care and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Analyses were performed probabilistically. RESULTS: Clinical effectiveness was higher for the cohort simulated to receive personalised care compared with usual care; the average difference in QALYs was 3.84 (95 percentile range -8.39 to 16.20). Costs were saved on drugs: euro2 314 354. Testing costs amounted to euro10 872. Mean total savings were euro2 561 648 (95 percentile range -3 252 529 to -1 898 087), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro666 500 or euro646 266 saved per QALY gained from a societal or healthcare perspective, respectively. In 72% of simulations personalised care saved costs and resulted in more QALYs, in 28% it was cost saving with lower QALYs. Scenario analyses showed cost saving along with QALYs gain or limited loss.

The costs and health outcomes were simulated for three pairs of eligible HAE patient groups (active treatment and corresponding placebo). The incremental costs of each intervention compared with placebo were listed together (direct or indirect comparisons between options were impossible due to limited clinical data available). RESULTS: The incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) for the evaluated interventions compared with placebo were as follows: EUR 15,226 per QALY (Ruconest((R))) and EUR 27,786 per QALY (Berinert((R)) P). The probability of cost-utility (ICUR < EUR 24,279 per QALY) assessed for Ruconest((R)) administered in the case of acute angioedema attack was 61% and 41% for Berinert((R)) P.

METHODS: Three treatment strategies were compared: universal clopidogrel therapy, universal ticagrelor therapy and genotyping CYP2C19 with use of ticagrelor for individuals with a LoF allele and clopidogrel for individuals without a LoF allele. Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years for each treatment strategy were estimated using a Markov model. The risks of events were primarily derived from the genetic substudy of the pivotal randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: CYP2C19 genotyping resulted in greater effectiveness and was cost-effective when compared with universal use of clopidogrel. However, universal use of ticagrelor was the most effective strategy overall and the incremental cost-effectiveness compared with the genotyping strategy was generally within what is considered acceptable.

12109,Cost-effectiveness of apixaban compared to warfarin in the management of atrial fibrillation in Australia,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with a moderate to severe risk of stroke, from an Australian government-perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus warfarin, based on data from the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in AF (ARISTOTLE) trial. The model comprised five health states: ''Alive, no major bleeding or stroke'', ''Alive, no major bleeding, post stroke/systemic embolism'', ''Alive, post major bleeding, no stroke'', ''Alive, post-major bleeding and stroke'' and ''Dead''. Disease cost data was derived from the North-East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study and the Australian Refined Diagnose Related Groups. Costs of medications were based on data from the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. Utility data was derived from published sources, and an annual discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. The main outcome of interest was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per life year gained (LYG) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: Over 20 years, in the sample of 1000 subjects the model predicted that compared to warfarin, apixaban led to a (discounted) of 0.33 LYG and 0.31 QALYs gained, at a net cost of $4,308 per-person. These equated to ICERs of $AUD12, 914 per LYG and $AUD13, 679 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that apixaban was cost-effective at 99.0% probability using willingness to pay thresholds of $AUD45 000 per LYG and QALY.

12110,The cost-effectiveness of a structured education pulmonary rehabilitation programme for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in primary care: the PRINCE cluster randomised trial,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a structured education pulmonary rehabilitation programme (SEPRP) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) relative to usual practice in primary care. The programme consisted of group-based sessions delivered jointly by practice nurses and physiotherapists over 8 weeks. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis alongside a cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 32 general practices in Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: 350 adults with COPD, 69% of whom were moderately affected. INTERVENTIONS: Intervention arm (n=178) received a 2 h group-based SEPRP session per week over 8 weeks delivered jointly by a practice nurse and physiotherapist at the practice surgery or nearby venue. The control arm (n=172) received the usual practice in primary care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire (CRQ) scores, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained estimated using the generic EQ5D instrument, and expected cost-effectiveness at 22 weeks trial follow-up. RESULTS: The intervention was associated with an increase of euro944 (95% CIs 489 to 1400) in mean healthcare cost and euro261 (95% CIs 226 to 296) in mean patient cost. The intervention was associated with a mean improvement of 1.11 (95% CIs 0.35 to 1.87) in CRQ Total score and 0.002 (95% CIs -0.006 to 0.011) in QALYs gained. These translated into incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of euro850 per unit increase in CRQ Total score and euro472 000 per additional QALY gained. The probability of the intervention being cost-effective at respective threshold values of euro5000, euro15 000, euro25 000, euro35 000 and euro45 000 was 0.980, 0.992, 0.994, 0.994 and 0.994 in the CRQ Total score analysis compared to 0.000, 0.001, 0.001, 0.003 and 0.007 in the QALYs gained analysis. CONCLUSIONS: While analysis suggests that SEPRP was cost-effective if society is willing to pay at least euro850 per one-point increase in disease-specific CRQ, no evidence exists when effectiveness was measured in QALYS gained.

12111,Cost-effectiveness of one year dementia follow-up care by memory clinics or general practitioners: economic evaluation of a randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of post-diagnosis dementia treatment and coordination of care by memory clinics compared to general practitioners'' care. METHODS: A multicentre randomised trial with 175 community dwelling patients newly diagnosed with mild to moderate dementia, and their informal caregivers, with twelve months'' follow-up. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated from a societal point of view and presented as incremental cost per quality adjusted life year. To establish cost-effectiveness, a cost-utility analysis was conducted using utilities based on the EQ-5D. Uncertainty surrounding the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (difference in costs divided by difference in effects) was calculated by bootstrapping from the original data. RESULTS: Compared to general practitioners'' care, treatment by the memory clinics was on average euro1024 (95% CI: -euro7723 to euro5674) cheaper, and showed a non-significant decrease of 0.025 (95% CI: -0.114 to 0.064) quality adjusted life years. The incremental cost-effectiveness point estimate from the bootstrap simulation was euro 41 442 per QALY lost if one would use memory clinic care instead of general practitioner care. CONCLUSION: No evidence was found that memory clinics were more cost-effective compared to general practitioners with regard to post-diagnosis treatment and coordination of care of patients with dementia in the first year after diagnosis.

METHODS: An age-structured cohort model was developed for the 2011 Indonesia birth cohort. We compared four interventions in scenarios: (i) base-case (I(0)) reflecting the current situation for the population of under-5-years-old, (ii) with an additional breastfeeding education intervention (I(1)), (iii) with a support intervention on initiation and duration (I(2)) and (iv) with both of these two interventions combined (I(3)). The model applied a 5-years time horizon, with 1 month analytical cycles for children less than 1 year of age and annually thereafter. Monte Carlo simulations were used to examine the economic acceptability and affordability of rotavirus vaccination. RESULTS: Rotavirus immunization would effectively reduce severe cases of rotavirus during the first 5 years of a child''s life even assuming various breastfeeding promotion interventions. The total yearly vaccine cost would amount to US$ 64 million under the market vaccine price. Cost-effectiveness would increase to US$ 153 per quality-adjusted-life-year (societal perspective) with an optimal breastfeeding promotion intervention. Obviously, this is much lower than the 2011 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita of US$ 3,495. Affordability results showed that at the market vaccine price, rotavirus vaccination could be affordable for the Indonesian health system.

12116,Cost-utility of self-managed computer therapy for people with aphasia,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the potential cost-effectiveness of self-managed computer therapy for people with long-standing aphasia post stroke and to estimate the value of further research. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of computer therapy in addition to usual stimulation compared with usual stimulation alone was considered in people with long-standing aphasia using data from the CACTUS trial. A model-based approach was taken. Where possible the input parameters required for the model were obtained from the CACTUS trial data, a United Kingdom-based pilot randomized controlled trial that recruited thirty-four people with aphasia and randomized them to computer treatment or usual care. Cost-effectiveness was described using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) together with cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. A value of information analysis was undertaken to inform future research priorities. RESULTS: The intervention had an ICER of pound3,058 compared with usual care. The likelihood of the intervention being cost-effective was 75.8 percent at a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained. The expected value of perfect information was pound37 million. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that computer therapy for people with long-standing aphasia is likely to represent a cost-effective use of resources. However, our analysis is exploratory given the small size of the trial it is based upon and therefore our results are uncertain. Further research would be of high value, particularly with respect to the quality of life gain achieved by people who respond well to therapy.",2013-01-14801,24290333,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Nicholas R Latimer,2013,29 / 4,402-9,No,24290333,"Nicholas R Latimer; Simon Dixon; Rebecca Palmer; Cost-utility of self-managed computer therapy for people with aphasia, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, ; 29(4):0266-4623; 402-9",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Self-managed computer therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,3058,United Kingdom,2011,5644.71
12117,"Cost effectiveness of first-line treatment with doxorubicin/ifosfamide compared to trabectedin monotherapy in the management of advanced soft tissue sarcoma in Italy, Spain, and sweden","Background. Doxorubicin/ifosfamide is a first-line systemic chemotherapy for the majority of advanced soft tissue sarcoma (ASTS) subtypes. Trabectedin is indicated for the treatment of ASTS after failure of anthracyclines and/or ifosfamide; however it is being increasingly used off-label as a first-line treatment. This study estimated the cost effectiveness of these two treatments in the first-line management of ASTS in Italy, Spain, and Sweden. Methods. A Markov model was constructed to estimate the cost effectiveness of doxorubicin/ifosfamide compared to trabectedin monotherapy, defined as the cost per QALY gained, in each country. Results. First-line treatment with doxorubicin/ifosfamide resulted in lower two-year healthcare costs and more QALYs than first-line treatment with trabectedin monotherapy in all three countries.

12120,"All-oral, interferon-free treatment for chronic hepatitis C: cost-effectiveness analyses","Interferon-based standard of care treatments (SOC) for chronic hepatitis C are unable to provide high cure rates in certain subgroups of the infected population and can cause debilitating side effects. Clinical trials evaluating all-oral, interferon-free treatments have demonstrated high rates of sustained virologic response with no resistance or major adverse events in most populations. As these drug regimens move towards FDA approval, it will be important to assess their cost-effectiveness in addition to their clinical efficacy. A decision-analytic Markov model with a lifetime, societal perspective was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a generalized all-oral drug regimen compared to SOC by modelling the progression of a 50-year-old, HCV-positive cohort through disease natural history and treatment. In base case analysis, all-oral treatment dominated SOC across a range of willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$44,514/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In sensitivity analyses, the model was sensitive to all-oral drug costs as well as rates of SVR and treatment uptake among noncirrhotic subjects, but robust to variations in all other parameters. All-oral treatment was most cost-effective among genotype 1 subjects but remained cost-effective for genotypes 2 and 3 at WTP thresholds >/=$80,000/QALY. Quality-adjusted life years gained per dollar spent were maximized in younger treatment cohorts. Using this model, the degree of cost-effectiveness depended on the WTP threshold and the final cost set for approved drug combinations.",2013-01-14819,24304454,J Viral Hepat,L M Hagan,2013,20 / 12,847-57,No,24304454,"L M Hagan; Z Yang; M Ehteshami; R F Schinazi; All-oral, interferon-free treatment for chronic hepatitis C: cost-effectiveness analyses, J Viral Hepat, ; 20(12):1352-0504; 847-57",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,All-oral drug regimen vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,64 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,44514,United States,2012,50178.63

12126,Cost-effectiveness of a genetic test for breast cancer risk,"Genetic testing of seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (7SNP) can improve estimates of risk of breast cancer relative to the Gail risk test alone, for the purpose of recommending MRI screening for women at high risk. A simulation of breast cancer and health care processes was used to conduct a virtual trial comparing the use of the 7SNP test with the Gail risk test to categorize patients by risk. Average-risk patients received annual mammogram, whereas high-risk patients received annual MRI. Cancer incidence was based on Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data and validated to Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort data.

12131,Managing to low-density lipoprotein particles compared with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses of clinical trials have shown that using statins to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces cardiovascular events, and more intensive lowering of LDL-C further decreases the risk of occlusive vascular events. Lipoprotein studies suggest treating patients more aggressively when low-density lipoprotein particle (LDL-P) number is discordantly high in the presence of normal LDL-C levels. Failure to manage LDL-P numbers may lead to additional direct and indirect costs. OBJECTIVE: This analysis modeled direct and indirect costs associated with cardiovascular events due to suboptimal treatment resulting from discordance between LDL-C and LDL-P levels. METHODS: The analysis was conducted from the payer perspective and the employer perspective, respectively, over a 3-year time period. Clinical data were obtained from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a community-based population study. The employer perspective included indirect costs and quality-adjusted life years in addition to the direct costs and cardiovascular disease events considered in the payer analysis. All costs are reported in 2011 dollars. RESULTS: From the payer perspective, managing LDL-C and LDL-P in comparison with LDL-C alone reduced costs ($21,212) and cardiovascular events (9 events). Similar patterns were observed for managing LDL-P alone in comparison with LDL-C. From the employer perspective, managing both LDL-P alone or in combination with LDL-C also resulted in lower costs, fewer cardiovascular disease events, and increased quality-adjusted life years in comparison with LDL-C.

12135,"A prospective trial of GreenLight PVP (HPS120) versus transurethral resection of the prostate in the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in Ontario, Canada","BACKGROUND: Photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) is a bloodless, relatively painless alternative to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). OBJECTIVE: We compare the effectiveness, safety and cost-effectiveness of Greenlight Laser PVP (HPS-120) and TURP. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, non-randomized trial in 3 Ontario centres from March 2008 to February 2011. Assessments were completed at baseline, 1 and 6 months following surgery at the physicians'' offices and at 12 and 24 months by phone. The primary outcome was the change in International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) score at 6 months versus baseline. Secondary outcomes were changes in flow rate, postvoid residual (PVR), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) scores. Adverse events, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), resource utilization and productivity losses were collected. RESULTS: Although the IPSS decreased in both arms (n = 140 for PVP and n = 24 for TURP) between baseline and 6 months, the difference in change over time between the groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.718). Other outcomes improved equally from baseline and 6 months (Qmax, SHIM, PSA and HRQoL), with only changes in PVR favouring PVP (p = 0.018). There were no statistical differences in serious adverse events. In total, 130 of 140 PVP patients were outpatients, all TURP subjects were inpatients. PVP was less costly than TURP ($3891 vs. $4863; p < 0.001) with similar quality-adjusted life years (0.448 vs. 0.441; p = 0.658).

12136,"Mifamurtide for high-grade, resectable, nonmetastatic osteosarcoma following surgical resection: a cost-effectiveness analysis","OBJECTIVES: Mifamurtide is an immune macrophage stimulant that when added to standard chemotherapy has demonstrated survival benefit for newly diagnosed osteosarcoma. The objectives of this study were to investigate the cost-effectiveness of adding mifamurtide to standard three- or four-agent chemotherapy for high-grade, resectable, nonmetastatic osteosarcoma following surgical resection and the issues of obtaining robust cost-effectiveness estimates for ultra-orphan drugs, given the shortage of data. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted from the perspective of the UK''s National Health Service as part of the manufacturer''s submission to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The disease process was simplified to a transition through a series of health states, modeled by using a Markov approach. Data to inform the model were derived from patient-level data of Study INT-0133, published literature, and expert opinion. The final efficacy measure was life-years gained (LYG), and utilities were used to obtain quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: For a 60-year time frame and a discount rate of 3.5% for outcomes, patients receiving mifamurtide benefited from an average additional 1.57 years of life and 1.34 QALYs, compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound58,737 per LYG and pound68,734 per QALY. Because treatment effects were both substantial in restoring health and sustained over a very long period, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence changed its guidance to allow a discount of 1.5% for outcomes to be applied in these special circumstances. By using this discount factor, it was found that patients receiving mifamurtide had an average additional 2.58 years of life and 2.20 QALYs compared with patients receiving chemotherapy alone, resulting in an ICER of pound35,765 per LYG and pound41,933 per QALY.

12137,Treating to the target of remission in early rheumatoid arthritis is cost-effective: results of the DREAM registry,"BACKGROUND: Where health economic studies are frequently performed using modelling, with input from randomized controlled trials and best guesses, we used real-life data to analyse the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a treatment strategy aiming to the target of remission compared to usual care in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: We used real-life data from comparable cohorts in the Dutch Rheumatoid Arthritis Monitoring (DREAM) registry: the DREAM remission induction cohort (treat-to-target, T2T) and the Nijmegen early RA inception cohort (usual care, UC). Both cohorts were followed prospectively using the DREAM registry methodology. All patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA and were included in the cohort at the time of diagnosis. The T2T cohort was treated according to a protocolised strategy aiming at remission (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) < 2.6). The UC cohort was treated without DAS28-guided treatment decisions. EuroQol-5D utility scores were estimated from the Health Assessment Questionnaire. A health care perspective was adopted and direct medical costs were collected. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) per patient in remission and incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were calculated over two and three years of follow-up. RESULTS: Two year data were available for 261 T2T patients and 213 UC patients; an extended follow-up of three years was available for 127 and 180 patients, respectively. T2T produced higher remission percentages and a larger gain in QALYs than UC. The ICER was euro 3,591 per patient in remission after two years and T2T was dominant after three years. The ICUR was euro 19,410 per QALY after two years and T2T was dominant after three years.

12139,Economic evaluation of first-line adjuvant chemotherapies for resectable gastric cancer patients in China,"BACKGROUND: First-line postoperative adjuvant chemotherapies with S-1 and capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) were first recommended for resectable gastric cancer patients in the 2010 and 2011 Chinese NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology: Gastric Cancer; however, their economic impact in China is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy with XELOX, with S-1 and no treatment after a gastrectomy with extended (D2) lymph-node dissection among patients with stage II-IIIB gastric cancer. METHODS: A Markov model, based on data from two clinical phase III trials, was developed to analyse the cost-effectiveness of patients in the XELOX group, S-1 group and surgery only (SO) group. The costs were estimated from the perspective of Chinese healthcare system. The utilities were assumed on the basis of previously published reports. Costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated with a lifetime horizon. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For the base case, XELOX had the lowest total cost ($44,568) and cost-effectiveness ratio ($7,360/QALY). The relative scenario analyses showed that SO was dominated by XELOX and the ICERs of S-1 was $58,843/QALY compared with XELOX. The one-way sensitivity analysis showed that the most influential parameter was the utility of disease-free survival. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted a 75.8% likelihood that the ICER for XELOX would be less than $13,527 compared with S-1. When ICER was more than $38,000, the likelihood of cost-effectiveness achieved by S-1 group was greater than 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that for patients in China with resectable disease, first-line adjuvant chemotherapy with XELOX after a D2 gastrectomy is a best option comparing with S-1 and SO in view of our current study.

The treatments were compared with each other and with no treatment. METHODS: We performed this economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial. The study included 250 women aged 18-70, with SUI >/= 1 time/week, who were randomized to 3 months of pelvic floor muscle training via either an Internet-based program including e-mail support from an urotherapist (n = 124) or a program sent by post (n = 126).

Treatment costs were continuously registered. Data on participants'' time for training, incontinence aids, and laundry were collected at baseline, 4 months, and 1 year. We also measured quality of life with the condition-specific questionnaire ICIQ-LUTSqol, and calculated the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained.

12145,C-QUALITY: cost and quality-of-life pharmacoeconomic analysis of antidepressants used in major depressive disorder in the regional Italian settings of Veneto and Sardinia,"BACKGROUND: Major depression is a commonly occurring, seriously impairing, and often recurrent mental disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the treatments most commonly used for major depressive disorder. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of major depressive disorder in two Italian regional settings, ie, Veneto and Sardinia. METHODS: A decision analytic model was adapted from the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency to reflect current clinical practice in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the most significant Italian regions. This adaptation was possible as a result of collaboration with an expert panel of Italian psychiatrists and health economists. The population comprised patients with a first diagnosis of major depressive disorder and initiating one SSRI or SNRI drug for the first time. The time frame used was 12 months. Efficacy and utility data for the model were retrieved from the literature and validated by the expert panel. Local data were used for resource utilization and for treatment costs based on the perspective of each regional health service. Scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Base case analysis showed that escitalopram is associated with the largest health gain (in quality-adjusted life years) and a lower total cost at one year for Sardinia (except for sertraline, against which it was cost-effective) and for Veneto, and therefore dominates the other treatment strategies, given that more quality-adjusted life years are achieved at a lower total cost.

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of SSRIs and SNRIs in the treatment of major depressive disorder in two Italian regional settings, ie, Veneto and Sardinia. METHODS: A decision analytic model was adapted from the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency to reflect current clinical practice in the treatment of major depressive disorder in the most significant Italian regions. This adaptation was possible as a result of collaboration with an expert panel of Italian psychiatrists and health economists. The population comprised patients with a first diagnosis of major depressive disorder and initiating one SSRI or SNRI drug for the first time. The time frame used was 12 months. Efficacy and utility data for the model were retrieved from the literature and validated by the expert panel. Local data were used for resource utilization and for treatment costs based on the perspective of each regional health service. Scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Base case analysis showed that escitalopram is associated with the largest health gain (in quality-adjusted life years) and a lower total cost at one year for Sardinia (except for sertraline, against which it was cost-effective) and for Veneto, and therefore dominates the other treatment strategies, given that more quality-adjusted life years are achieved at a lower total cost.

12159,Magnesium sulphate for fetal neuroprotection: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of administering magnesium sulphate to patients in whom preterm birth at < 32+0 weeks gestation is either imminent or threatened for the purpose of fetal neuroprotection. METHODS: Multiple decision tree models and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to compare the administration of magnesium sulphate with the alternative of no treatment. Two separate cost perspectives were utilized in this series of analyses: a health system and a societal perspective. In addition, two separate measures of effectiveness were utilized: cases of cerebral palsy (CP) averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: From a health system and a societal perspective, respectively, a savings of $2,242 and $112,602 is obtained for each QALY gained and a savings of $30,942 and $1,554,198 is obtained for each case of CP averted when magnesium sulphate is administered to patients in whom preterm birth is imminent. From a health system perspective and a societal perspective, respectively, a cost of $2,083 is incurred and a savings of $108,277 is obtained for each QALY gained and a cost of $28,755 is incurred and a savings of $1,494,500 is obtained for each case of CP averted when magnesium sulphate is administered to patients in whom preterm birth is threatened. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of magnesium sulphate to patients in whom preterm birth is imminent is a dominant (i.e. cost-effective) strategy, no matter what cost perspective or measure of effectiveness is used.

Two separate cost perspectives were utilized in this series of analyses: a health system and a societal perspective. In addition, two separate measures of effectiveness were utilized: cases of cerebral palsy (CP) averted and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: From a health system and a societal perspective, respectively, a savings of $2,242 and $112,602 is obtained for each QALY gained and a savings of $30,942 and $1,554,198 is obtained for each case of CP averted when magnesium sulphate is administered to patients in whom preterm birth is imminent. From a health system perspective and a societal perspective, respectively, a cost of $2,083 is incurred and a savings of $108,277 is obtained for each QALY gained and a cost of $28,755 is incurred and a savings of $1,494,500 is obtained for each case of CP averted when magnesium sulphate is administered to patients in whom preterm birth is threatened. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of magnesium sulphate to patients in whom preterm birth is imminent is a dominant (i.e. cost-effective) strategy, no matter what cost perspective or measure of effectiveness is used. Administration of magnesium sulphate to patients in whom preterm birth is threatened is a dominant strategy from a societal perspective and is very likely to be cost-effective from a health system perspective.",2013-01-14903,24350635,BMC Health Serv Res,Celeste D Bickford,2013,13 /,527,Yes,24350635,"Celeste D Bickford; Laura A Magee; Craig Mitton; Marie Kruse; Anne R Synnes; Diane Sawchuck; Melanie Basso; Vyta M Senikas; Peter von Dadelszen; MAG-CP Working Group; Magnesium sulphate for fetal neuroprotection: a cost-effectiveness analysis, BMC Health Serv Res, ; 13():1472-6963; 527",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Magnesium sulphate, threatened preterm birth vs. None",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-109359.99,Canada,2011,-127270.24
12161,Cost-effectiveness analysis of intracranial stent placement versus contemporary medical management in patients with symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis,"BACKGROUND: Intracranial angioplasty and stent placement has been increasingly evaluated as a new method for treatment of symptomatic intracranial stenosis in select patients. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved intracranial stent treatment of symptomatic atherosclerotic intracranial lesions. PURPOSE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of intracranial artery stent placement compared with contemporary medical management for secondary stroke prevention among patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis. METHODS: Clinical outcome data were obtained from the aspirin treatment arm of the Comparison of Warfarin and Aspirin for Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial (n = 280) and 12 case series (n = 216) of patients who underwent stent placement of symptomatic intracranial stenosis with comparable characteristics. Total cost of procedure and medical management-only was calculated using the rates of major stroke, minor stroke, or death in each group. All costs are expressed in 2010 US$. The quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of each intervention strategy was estimated using the frequency of the outcomes of major and minor stroke, death, and baseline health. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was formulated for a 1-year period. RESULTS: The total rate of stroke at one year was 10.2% (6.1-14.2%) and the rate of all-cause mortality was 3.7% (1.2-6.2%) in the stent group. The corresponding annualized rates of stroke and all-cause mortality in the medical management-only group were 15% (10.8-19.2%) and 2.4% (0.6-4.2%), respectively. The calculated net costs at one year for intracranial stent placement and contemporary medical management were US$16,898 and US$3,468, respectively. Overall, QALYs for the two groups were 0.82 and 0.81 (in a range of 0 to 0.89 corresponding to death and baseline health), respectively. The cost per QALY gained after intracranial stent placement and contemporary medical therapy was US$20,542 and US$4,265, respectively. The corresponding ICER for stent versus medical treatment alone was US$1,416,268. CONCLUSION: The reduced risk of stroke following intracranial stent placement is offset by significantly higher procedure-associated net costs. Select procedures in patients with symptomatic stenosis of 70% or greater are more likely to be cost-effective.",2013-01-14915,24358413,J Vasc Interv Neurol,Amir Khan,2013,6 / 2,25-9,No,24358413,"Amir Khan; Ameer Hassan; Fareed Suri; Adnan Qureshi; Cost-effectiveness analysis of intracranial stent placement versus contemporary medical management in patients with symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis, J Vasc Interv Neurol, ; 6(2):1941-5893; 25-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intracranial artery stent placement vs. contemporary medical management,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,1416268,United States,2010,1680970.66
12162,Economic evaluation of Manitoba Health Lines in the management of congestive heart failure,"OBJECTIVE: This one-year study investigated whether the Manitoba Provincial Health Contact program for congestive heart failure (CHF) is a cost-effective intervention relative to the standard treatment. DESIGN: Individual patient-level, randomized clinical trial of cost-effective model using data from the Health Research Data Repository at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, University of Manitoba. METHODS: A total of 179 patients aged 40 and over with a diagnosis of CHF levels II to IV were recruited from Winnipeg and Central Manitoba and randomized into three treatment groups: one receiving standard care, a second receiving Health Lines (HL) intervention and a third receiving Health Lines intervention plus in-house monitoring (HLM). A cost-effectiveness study was conducted in which outcomes were measured in terms of QALYs derived from the SF-36 and costs using 2005 Canadian dollars. Costs included intervention and healthcare utilization. Bootstrap-resampled incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were computed to take into account the uncertainty related to small sample size. RESULTS: The total per-patient mean costs (including intervention cost) were not significantly different between study groups. Both interventions (HL and HLM) cost less and are more effective than standard care, with HL able to produce an additional QALY relative to HLM for $2,975. The sensitivity analysis revealed that there is an 85.8% probability that HL is cost-effective if decision-makers are willing to pay $50,000. CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate that the HL intervention from the Manitoba Provincial Health Contact program for CHF is an optimal intervention strategy for CHF management compared to standard care and HLM.",2013-01-14916,24359716,Healthc Policy,Yang Cui,2013,9 / 2,36-50,No,24359716,"Yang Cui; Malcolm Doupe; Alan Katz; Paul Nyhof; Evelyn L Forget; Economic evaluation of Manitoba Health Lines in the management of congestive heart failure, Healthc Policy, ; 9(2):1715-6572; 36-50",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Health Lines vs. in-house monitoring,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,2975,Canada,2005,3256.28
12163,Routine HIV screening in Portugal: clinical impact and cost-effectiveness,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of routine HIV screening in Portugal to the current practice of targeted and on-demand screening. DESIGN: We used Portuguese national clinical and economic data to conduct a model-based assessment. METHODS: We compared current HIV detection practices to strategies of increasingly frequent routine HIV screening in Portuguese adults aged 18-69. We considered several subpopulations and geographic regions with varying levels of undetected HIV prevalence and incidence. Baseline inputs for the national case included undiagnosed HIV prevalence 0.16%, annual incidence 0.03%, mean population age 43 years, mean CD4 count at care initiation 292 cells/muL, 63% HIV test acceptance, 78% linkage to care, and HIV rapid test cost euro6 under the proposed routine screening program. Outcomes included quality-adjusted survival, secondary HIV transmission, cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: One-time national HIV screening increased HIV-infected survival from 164.09 quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) to 166.83 QALMs compared to current practice and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro28,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Screening more frequently in higher-risk groups was cost-effective: for example screening annually in men who have sex with men or screening every three years in regions with higher incidence and prevalence produced ICERs of euro21,000/QALY and euro34,000/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: One-time HIV screening in the Portuguese national population will increase survival and is cost-effective by international standards. More frequent screening in higher-risk regions and subpopulations is also justified.

DESIGN: We used Portuguese national clinical and economic data to conduct a model-based assessment. METHODS: We compared current HIV detection practices to strategies of increasingly frequent routine HIV screening in Portuguese adults aged 18-69. We considered several subpopulations and geographic regions with varying levels of undetected HIV prevalence and incidence. Baseline inputs for the national case included undiagnosed HIV prevalence 0.16%, annual incidence 0.03%, mean population age 43 years, mean CD4 count at care initiation 292 cells/muL, 63% HIV test acceptance, 78% linkage to care, and HIV rapid test cost euro6 under the proposed routine screening program. Outcomes included quality-adjusted survival, secondary HIV transmission, cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: One-time national HIV screening increased HIV-infected survival from 164.09 quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) to 166.83 QALMs compared to current practice and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro28,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY).

DESIGN: Model based economic analysis using data from the randomised controlled arm of the PLUTO (percutaneous vesico-amniotic shunting for lower urinary tract obstruction) trial. SETTING: Fetal medicine departments in United Kingdom, Ireland and Netherlands. POPULATION OR SAMPLE: Pregnant women with a male, singleton fetus with LUTO. METHODS: Costs and outcomes were prospectively collected in the trial; three separate base case analyses were performed using the intention to treat (ITT), per protocol and uniform prior methods. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore data uncertainty. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Survival at 28 days, 1 year and disease free survival at 1 year. RESULTS: VAS was more expensive but appeared to result in higher rates of survival compared with conservative management in patients with LUTO. Using ITT analysis the incremental cost effectiveness ratios based on outcomes of survival at 28 days, 1 year, or 1 morbidity-free year on the VAS arm were pound 15,506, pound 15,545, and pound 43,932, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: VAS is a more expensive option compared to the conservative approach in the management of individuals with LUTO. Data from the RCT suggest that VAS improves neonatal survival but does not result in significant improvements in morbidity. Our analysis concludes that VAS is not likely to be cost effective in the management of these patients given the NICE (National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence) cost threshold of pound 20,000 per QALY.",2013-01-14940,24376546,PLoS One,Lavanya Diwakar,2013,8 / 12,e82564,No,24376546,"Lavanya Diwakar; Rachel K Morris; Pelham Barton; Lee J Middleton; Mark D Kilby; Tracy E Roberts; Evaluation of the cost effectiveness of vesico-amniotic shunting in the management of congenital lower urinary tract obstruction (based on data from the PLUTO Trial), PLoS One , ; 8(12):1932-6203; e82564",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vesico Amniotic Shunt vs. conservative management,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,14263.63,United Kingdom,2011,26328.99
12176,Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR-guided targeted biopsy versus systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in diagnosing prostate cancer: a modelling study from a health care perspective,"BACKGROUND: The current diagnostic strategy using transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSGB) raises concerns regarding overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer (PCa). Interest in integrating multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance-guided biopsy (MRGB) into the diagnostic pathway to reduce overdiagnosis and improve grading is gaining ground, but it remains uncertain whether this image-based strategy is cost-effective. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of multiparametric MRI and MRGB compared with TRUSGB. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A combined decision tree and Markov model for men with elevated prostate-specific antigen (>4 ng/ml) was developed. Input data were derived from systematic literature searches, meta-analyses, and expert opinion. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and health care costs of both strategies were modelled over 10 yr after initial suspicion of PCa. Probabilistic and threshold analyses were performed to assess uncertainty. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Despite uncertainty around the presented cost-effectiveness estimates, our results suggest that the MRI strategy is cost-effective compared with the standard of care. Expected costs per patient were euro 2423 for the MRI strategy and euro 2392 for the TRUSGB strategy. Corresponding QALYs were higher for the MRI strategy (7.00 versus 6.90), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 323 per QALY. Threshold analysis revealed that MRI is cost-effective when sensitivity of MRGB is >/= 20%. The probability that the MRI strategy is cost-effective is around 80% at willingness to pay thresholds higher than euro 2000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Total costs of the MRI strategy are almost equal with the standard of care, while reduction of overdiagnosis and overtreatment with the MRI strategy leads to an improvement in quality of life. PATIENT SUMMARY: We compared costs and quality of life (QoL) of the standard ""blind"" diagnostic technique with an image-based technique for men with suspicion of prostate cancer. Our results suggest that costs were comparable, with higher QoL for the image-based technique.",2013-01-14942,24377803,Eur Urol,Maarten de Rooij,2014,66 / 3,,No,24377803,"Maarten de Rooij; Simone Crienen; J Alfred Witjes; Jelle O Barentsz; Maroeska M Rovers; Janneke P C Grutters; Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and MR-guided targeted biopsy versus systematic transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy in diagnosing prostate cancer: a modelling study from a health care perspective, Eur Urol, 2014 Sep; 66(3):0302-2838",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Magnetic resonance imaging vs. transrectal ultrasound–guided biopsy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,10 Years,4.00,1.50,323,Euro,2011,517.16
12177,Routine prophylactic central neck dissection for low-risk papillary thyroid cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Routine prophylactic central neck dissection (pCND) after total thyroidectomy (TTX) for low-risk papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) offers the potential to decrease disease recurrence but may increase operative complications. We hypothesized that routine pCND is not cost-effective in low-risk PTC. METHODS: A Markov transition-state model was constructed to compare TTX with and without pCND. Outcome probabilities, utilities, and costs were estimated on the basis of literature review. The threshold for cost-effectiveness was $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis was used to examine model uncertainty. RESULTS: pCND cost $10,315 and produced an effectiveness of 23.785 quality-adjusted life years. This strategy was more costly and less effective than TTX without pCND and was therefore dominated. pCND became cost-effective when the probability of recurrence increased from 6% to 10.3%, cost of reoperation for recurrence increased from $8,900 to $26,120, or added probabilities of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypoparathyroidism due to pCND were less than 0.20% and 0.18% during 2-way sensitivity analysis. Monte Carlo simulation showed that pCND was not cost-effective in 97.3% of iterations. CONCLUSION: Routine pCND for low-risk PTC is not cost-effective unless the recurrence rate is greater than 10.3%.

By evaluating the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance in Singaporean Chinese, this study aimed to inform the implementation of such a program in a population with a low to intermediate GC risk. METHODS: USING A REFERENCE STRATEGY OF NO OGD INTERVENTION, WE EVALUATED FOUR STRATEGIES: 2-yearly OGD surveillance, annual OGD surveillance, 2-yearly OGD screening and 2-yearly screening plus annual surveillance in Singaporean Chinese aged 50-69 years. From a perspective of the healthcare system, Markov models were built to simulate the life experience of the target population. The models projected discounted lifetime costs ($), quality adjusted life year (QALY), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) indicating the cost-effectiveness of each strategy against a Singapore willingness-to-pay of $46,200/QALY. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to identify the influential variables and their associated thresholds, and to quantify the influence of parameter uncertainties respectively. RESULTS: With an ICER of $44,098/QALY, the annual OGD surveillance was the optimal strategy while the 2-yearly surveillance was the most cost-effective strategy (ICER = $25,949/QALY). The screening-based strategies were either extendedly dominated or cost-ineffective. The cost-effectiveness heterogeneity of the four strategies was observed across age-gender subgroups. Eight influential parameters were identified each with their specific thresholds to define the choice of optimal strategy. Accounting for the model uncertainties, the probability that the annual surveillance is the optimal strategy in Singapore was 44.5%.

12182,Cost-Effectiveness of Infliximab for the Treatment of Acute Exacerbations of Ulcerative Colitis in the Netherlands,"INTRODUCTION: Infliximab is registered for the treatment of moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis (UC) adult patients who have had an inadequate response, or are intolerant, or have medical contraindications to therapy including corticosteroids and 5-aminosalicylates or thiopurines (6-mercaptopurine [6-MP] or azathioprine [AZA]). The authors estimate the costs and effects and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of infliximab at the licensed dose of 5 mg/kg versus cyclosporine or surgery for the treatment of adult Dutch patients hospitalized with acute exacerbations of UC, refractory to intravenous steroids. METHOD: An existing decision analytical model was updated to simulate disease progression of hospitalized UC patients in the Netherlands, refractory to intravenous corticosteroids, and to estimate the costs and benefits associated with infliximab compared to cyclosporine and surgery over a 1-year time horizon. Colectomy rates were derived from infliximab and cyclosporine randomized trials and synthesized using multiple treatment comparison methods. The utility estimates associated with health states of ulcerative colitis patients were obtained from the literature. Resource use and drug use frequencies as well as unit costs were obtained from Dutch sources. The primary effectiveness measure used in the analysis was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: For a typical UC patient with body weight of 70 kg, the costs of treatment with infliximab, cyclosporine, and surgery over a 1-year treatment period were euro17,062, euro14,784, euro13,979, respectively. The associated numbers of QALYs were 0.80, 0.70, and 0.58 for infliximab, cyclosporine, and surgery respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for infliximab was euro24,277 per QALY gained compared to cyclosporine, and euro14,639 per QALY gained compared to surgery.

Resource use and drug use frequencies as well as unit costs were obtained from Dutch sources. The primary effectiveness measure used in the analysis was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: For a typical UC patient with body weight of 70 kg, the costs of treatment with infliximab, cyclosporine, and surgery over a 1-year treatment period were euro17,062, euro14,784, euro13,979, respectively. The associated numbers of QALYs were 0.80, 0.70, and 0.58 for infliximab, cyclosporine, and surgery respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for infliximab was euro24,277 per QALY gained compared to cyclosporine, and euro14,639 per QALY gained compared to surgery.

12184,Cost effectiveness of modified fractionation radiotherapy versus conventional radiotherapy for unresected non-small-cell lung cancer patients,"INTRODUCTION: Modified fractionation radiotherapy (RT), delivering multiple fractions per day or shortening the overall treatment time, improves overall survival for non -small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients compared with conventional fractionation RT (CRT). However, its cost effectiveness is unknown. Therefore, we aimed to examine and compare the cost effectiveness of different modified RT schemes and CRT in the curative treatment of unresected NSCLC patients. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was developed based on individual patient data from the meta-analysis of radiotherapy in lung cancer (N = 2000). Dutch health care costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs) were compared between two accelerated schemes (very accelerated RT [VART] and moderately accelerated RT [MART]), two hyperfractionated schemes (using an identical (HRT) or higher (HRT) total treatment dose than CRT) and CRT. RESULTS: All modified fractionations were more effective and costlier than CRT (1.12 QALYs, &OV0556;24,360). VART and MART were most effective (1.30 and 1.32 QALYs) and cost &OV0556;25,746 and &OV0556;26,208, respectively. HRT and HRT yielded less QALYs than the accelerated schemes (1.27 and 1.14 QALYs), and cost &OV0556;26,199 and &OV0556;29,683, respectively.

12188,Cost utility of hub-and-spoke telestroke networks from societal perspective,"BACKGROUND: A hub-and-spoke telestroke network is an effective way to extend quality emergency stroke care to remote hospitals and improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost utility of a telestroke network in the management of acute ischemic stroke from the societal perspective. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A lifetime Markov model was developed to compare the incremental costs and effectiveness of a telestroke network. One-year transition probabilities between the 3 health states based on the modified Rankin scale--minimal-to-no disability, moderate-to-severe disability, and death--were derived from literature. Costs included telemedicine setup and maintenance, initial and recurrent stroke treatment, rehabilitation, long-term care, and caregiver costs. Effectiveness was defined as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Model inputs were obtained from the literature supplemented by data from Georgia Health Sciences University and Mayo Clinic. The base case network included 1 hub and 7 spokes, and assumed no survival benefits from acute treatment in a network. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Compared with no network, patients treated in a telestroke network incurred $1436 lower costs and gained 0.02 QALYs over a lifetime. Incremental costs decreased from $444 for the first year to -$1436 over a lifetime; incremental QALYs increased from 0.002 for the first year to 0.02 over a lifetime. Overall, results were robust in the 1-way sensitivity analyses. A telestroke network became less cost-effective with increasing spoke-to-hub transfer rates.

BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness of NT-proBNP guidance in HF patients is unclear. It may create additional costs with uncertain benefits.

For cost-effectiveness analysis, 467 (94%) patients (age 76 +/- 7 years, 66% male) were eligible. Incremental cost-effectiveness was calculated as incremental costs per gained life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) within the 18-month trial period, as defined per protocol. RESULTS: NT-proBNP-guided therapy was dominant (i.e., more effective and less costly) over symptom-guided therapy, saving $2,979 USD (2.5 to 97.5% confidence interval [CI]: $8,758 to $3,265) per patient, with incremental effectiveness of +0.07 life-years and +0.05 QALYs. The probability of NT-proBNP-guided therapy being dominant was 80%, and the probability of saving 1 life-year or QALY at a cost of $50,000 was 97% and 93%, respectively. Exclusion of residence costs resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $5,870 per life-year gained. Cost-effectiveness of NT-proBNP-guided therapy was most pronounced in patients <75 years old and in those with <2 significant comorbidities, being dominant in all sensitivity analyses. In the worst-case scenario (excluding residence costs in those with >/=2 comorbidities), the ICER was $11,935 per life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP-guided therapy has a high probability of being cost effective in HF patients with reduced LVEF, particularly in patients age 60 to 75 years or with less than 2 comorbidities.

12196,Modified FLOX as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer patients in the public health system in Brazil: Effectiveness and cost-utility analysis,"Incorporation of new drugs for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has led to a clear improvement in overall patient survival, the added cost of treatment, however, is a major concern worldwide. The cost-effectiveness of using a modified FLOX (mFLOX) regimen for treating mCRC patients was delineated. In this study, 82 consecutive mCRC patients were treated with leucovorin (LV) at 20 mg/m2 in combination with weekly bolus of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (500 mg/m2) for 6 consecutive weeks and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2) at weeks 1, 3 and 5, every 8 weeks. Overall survival (OS) and toxicity were evaluated. A Markov Model with a 2-year time horizon and 2-week cycles was developed, comparing mFLOX and mFOLFOX6 in a Brazilian environment. Health outcomes were measured in quality-ajusted life years (QALYs). The median overall period of survival was 19 months, while the estimated 1-year survival was 75%. Response by RECIST was assessed in 33 patients. Partial response was observed in 39.4% of patients, while 36.3% were stable. The mFLOX regimen cost was BRL 9,000, while the mFOLFOX6 BRL 22,000 (1 EUR=2.29 BRL), leading to an incremental costed of BRL 13,000, considering a 20-week period of first-line therapy. The incremental effect of the mFOLFOX was of 0,117 QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of mFOLFOX6 was of BRL 110,344/QALY. The sensitivity analysis detected no differences in the outcome measures. In conclusion, the mFLOX is an active regimen in mCRC patients, possibly providing a cost-effective option in public health systems.",2013-01-15168,24649143,Mol Clin Oncol,Daniela R Nebuloni,2013,1 / 1,175-179,No,24649143,"Daniela R Nebuloni; Milena P Mak; Fabiano Hahn Souza; Daniel F Saragiotto; Thiago Julio; Gilberto Jr de Castro; Jorge Sabbaga; Paulo M Hoff; Modified FLOX as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer patients in the public health system in Brazil: Effectiveness and cost-utility analysis, Mol Clin Oncol, ; 1(1):2049-9450; 175-179",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Modified FOLFOX6 regimen vs. mFLOX regimen (20 mg/m2 leucovorin (LV) and 500 mg/m2 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and 85 mg/m2 oxaliplatin),Not Stated,70 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,5.00,5.00,110344,Brazil,2011,76152.12
12197,An economic evaluation of trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment of early HER2-positive breast cancer patients in Colombia,"OBJECTIVE: Trastuzumab (Herceptin), a recombinant, humanized, monoclonal antibody targeting HER2 is well established as an effective treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer. Evidence from developed countries showed that trastuzumab was cost-effective; but there are few evidences in developing countries. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment in Colombia. METHODS: A Markov health-state transition model was built to estimate clinical and economic outcomes in HER2-positive breast cancer with or without 12 months trastuzumab adjuvant chemotherapy over a lifetime perspective with annual transition cycles. The model incorporated five health states (diseasefree, local recurrence, distant recurrence, cardiac failure, and death). Baseline event rates and 3-year hazard ratio (HR=0.51, IC 95% 0.44-0.59; p<0.0001) were derived from 4-year follow up of the N9831 and NSABP B-31 trial. Costs and utility weights were obtained from the literature and were discounted by 5% annually. RESULTS: The model showed that the utilization of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment in early breast cancer can prolong 0.80 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), compared with standard chemotherapy, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$ 71,491 per QALY gained.

12198,Offering assisted peritoneal dialysis is a cost-effective alternative to the current care pathway in frail elderly Dutch patients,"BACKGROUND: With the Dutch population aging, the number of individuals 75 years old or more needing dialysis is growing. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding nurse-assisted peritoneal dialysis (aPD) to the usual care pathway in frail Dutch end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. METHODS: THE CURRENT DUTCH TREATMENT PATHWAY (CONSERVATIVE MANAGEMENT, CM: 40% and PD in nursing home, nhPD: 60%) was compared in a decision-tree model with a new approach where the proportion of patients on dialysis would increase to 80% (i.e. CM: 20%; nhPD: 20%; and aPD: 60%). In-center hemodialysis was added in a secondary analysis. Inputs included survival (from literature), utility (from literature), and costs (2009 official tariffs). A healthcare payer's perspective was used with a 5-year horizon. RESULTS: The new approach was almost cost neutral in the primary analysis (despite more patients on dialysis) and dominant (more effective and less expensive) in the secondary analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was only euro52/QALY. In the sensitivity analyses (primary and secondary analyses), the new approach was either dominant or cost-effective in approximately 75% of the simulations.
