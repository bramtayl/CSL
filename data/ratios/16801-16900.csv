16801,Cost-utility analysis of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C in Japan,"OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis C is the result of a ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus (hepatitis C virus; HCV). The Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH) estimated that 1.5-2 million people in Japan carry HCV. Six major HCV genotypes (GT) and a large number of subtypes have been described in the literature. In Japan, around 70% to 80% of people are infected with HCV genotype 1b. The progress of the disease primarily affects the liver and may lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nucleotide analogue NS5B inhibitor and ledipasvir (LDV) is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein. They are combined in a single tablet regimen for the treatment of GT1 patients and resulted in sustained virological response (SVR) above 94% in large phase III trials. This analysis assesses the cost-utility of LDV/SOF in GT1 patients in Japan. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 10,000 patients was followed through a Markov model until they reached 100 years of age. GT1 treatment-naive and experienced, non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients were studied separately. LDV/SOF was compared to several treatment regimens containing pegylated interferon (PEGIFN), telaprevir (TVR), simeprevir (SMV), daclatasvir (DCV), asunaprevir (ASV) and ribavirin (RBV). Discount rates of 2% were applied to costs and outcomes according to the Japanese guidelines. RESULTS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective against most comparators with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below JPY 5,000,000. By applying a societal perspective, LDV/SOF was the dominant treatment strategy in all cases. Moreover, LDV/SOF reduced the number of cases of advanced liver disease. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective compared to most of the currently recommended treatments. Furthermore, LDV/SOF extends treatments to HCV-infected patients who are ineligible for interferon and RBV-based regimens. LDV/SOF thus has the potential to help reduce the burden of HCV in Japan.",2017-01-22177,27609424,Curr Med Res Opin,Ataru Igarashi,2017,33 / 1,11-21,No,27609424,"Ataru Igarashi; Wentao Tang; Ines Guerra; Lucile Marie; Sandrine Cure; Michael Lopresti; Cost-utility analysis of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for the treatment of genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C in Japan, Curr Med Res Opin, 2017 Jan; 33(1):0300-7995; 11-21",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,12 week treatment of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir vs. telaprevir + pegylated interferon alfa-2b + ribavirin,genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C; non-cirrhotic; treatment naiive,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,2.00,2.00,Not Stated,Japan,2015,Not Stated

The Japan Society of Hepatology (JSH) estimated that 1.5-2 million people in Japan carry HCV. Six major HCV genotypes (GT) and a large number of subtypes have been described in the literature. In Japan, around 70% to 80% of people are infected with HCV genotype 1b. The progress of the disease primarily affects the liver and may lead to liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is a nucleotide analogue NS5B inhibitor and ledipasvir (LDV) is an inhibitor of the HCV NS5A protein. They are combined in a single tablet regimen for the treatment of GT1 patients and resulted in sustained virological response (SVR) above 94% in large phase III trials. This analysis assesses the cost-utility of LDV/SOF in GT1 patients in Japan. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort of 10,000 patients was followed through a Markov model until they reached 100 years of age. GT1 treatment-naive and experienced, non-cirrhotic and cirrhotic patients were studied separately. LDV/SOF was compared to several treatment regimens containing pegylated interferon (PEGIFN), telaprevir (TVR), simeprevir (SMV), daclatasvir (DCV), asunaprevir (ASV) and ribavirin (RBV). Discount rates of 2% were applied to costs and outcomes according to the Japanese guidelines. RESULTS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective against most comparators with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) below JPY 5,000,000. By applying a societal perspective, LDV/SOF was the dominant treatment strategy in all cases. Moreover, LDV/SOF reduced the number of cases of advanced liver disease. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: LDV/SOF was cost-effective compared to most of the currently recommended treatments.

Current treatment options have several limitations due to side effects, interferon intolerability and ineligibility, long treatment durations and low sustained virological responses (SVR) rates, especially for the most severe patients. Sofosbuvir (SOF) is the first nucleotide analog NS5B polymerase inhibitor with pan-genotypic activity. SOF, administered in combination with ribavirin (RBV) with or without pegylated interferon (PEGIFN) resulted in high SVR rates across genotype (GT) 1-6 patients.

SOF, administered in combination with ribavirin (RBV) with or without pegylated interferon (PEGIFN) resulted in high SVR rates across genotype (GT) 1-6 patients. It is also the first available regimen for patients that are unsuitable for interferon. This analysis assessed the cost-utility ratio of sofosbuvir in GT2 patients in Japan. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model followed a cohort of 10,000 GT2 patients until patients reached 100 years of age. Approximately 20% of patients initiated treatment at the cirrhotic stage. Comparators were based on the current recommendations in Japan, including PEGIFN with ribavirin (RBV), telaprevir (TVR) in combination with PEGIFN + RBV and no treatment. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 2%. RESULTS: Sofosbuvir was cost-effective across all the studied indications, especially in patients unsuitable for interferon, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) lower than JPY 5,000,000. Compared to the other treatments included in the analysis, SOF + RBV resulted in improved clinical outcomes. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: SOF combined with RBV was shown to be cost-effective in GT2 patients in Japan. Compared to PEGIFN + RBV, TVR + PEGIFN + RBV and no treatment SOF offers a more efficacious, shorter and better tolerated treatment option and extends treatment to reach HCV-infected patients who are ineligible for interferon-based regimens.

16826,Economic evaluation of long-term impacts of universal newborn hearing screening,"OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the long-term efficacious and economic impacts of universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS).

By estimating intervention and long-term costs on treatment and productivity losses and the utility of life years determined by the status of hearing loss, we computed base-case estimates of the incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs). The scattered plot of ICUR and acceptability curve was used to assess the economic results of aABR versus TEOAE or both versus no screening. STUDY SAMPLE: A hypothetical cohort of 200,000 Taiwanese newborns. RESULTS: TEOAE and aABR dominated over no screening strategy (ICUR = $-4800.89 and $-4111.23, indicating less cost and more utility). Given $20,000 of willingness to pay (WTP), the probability of being cost-effective of aABR against TEOAE was up to 90%.

16829,Clinical outcomes and economic impact of transcatheter mitral leaflet repair in heart failure patients,"BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a common valvular heart disorder requiring intervention once it becomes severe. Transcatheter mitral repair with the MitraClip device is a safe and effective therapy for selected patients denied surgery. The authors sought to evaluate the clinical outcomes and economic impact of this therapy compared to medical management in heart-failure patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study was comprised of two phases; an observational study of patients with heart failure and mitral regurgitation treated with either medical therapy or the MitraClip, and an economic model. Results of the observational study were used to estimate parameters for the decision model, which estimated costs, and benefits in a hypothetical cohort of patients with heart failure and moderate-to-severe mitral regurgitation treated with either standard medical therapy or MitraClip. The cohort of patients treated with the MitraClip was propensity matched to a population of heart failure patients, and their outcomes compared. At a mean follow-up of 22 months, all-cause mortality was 21% in the MitraClip cohort and 42% in the medical management cohort (p = .007). The decision model demonstrated that MitraClip increased life expectancy from 1.87-3.60 years and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) from 1.13-2.76 years. The incremental cost was $52,500 Canadian dollars, corresponding to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $32,300.00 per QALY gained. Results were sensitive to the survival benefit.

METHODS: A Microsoft Excel-based partitioned survival model comprising three health states (progression-free survival [PFS], post-progression survival, and death) was developed. Relevant comparators were chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy (C/R) and C/R with intent to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT). Data were obtained from the pivotal phase II single-arm trial in 102 patients (SG035-0003; NCT00848926), a systematic literature review and clinical expert opinions (where empirical evidence was unavailable). PFS and overall survival for brentuximab vedotin were estimated using 5-year follow-up data from SG035-0003, and extrapolated using event rates observed for comparator treatments from published survival data. Resource use included drug acquisition and administration; alloSCT; treatment of adverse events; and long-term follow-up. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base case, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for brentuximab vedotin was pound38,769 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) vs C/R, whereas C/R with intent to alloSCT was dominated by brentuximab vedotin. ICERs for brentuximab vedotin generated by the deterministic sensitivity analysis ranged between pound32,000- pound54,000 per QALY. Including productivity benefits reduced the ICER to pound28,881 per QALY. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include lack of comparative data from this single arm study and the heterogeneous population. Inconsistent baseline characteristic reporting across studies prevented complete assessment of heterogeneity and the extent of potential bias in clinical and cost-effectiveness estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Although the base case ICER is above the threshold usually applied in Scotland, it is relatively low compared with other orphan drugs, and lower than the ICER generated using a previous data cut of SG035-0003 that informed a positive recommendation from the Scottish Medicines Consortium, under its decision-making framework for assessment of ultra-orphan medicines.",2017-01-22463,27472034,J Med Econ,Christopher Parker,2017,20 / 1,8-18,Yes,27472034,"Christopher Parker; Beth Woods; James Eaton; Esprit Ma; Ross Selby; Eugene Benson; Andreas Engstrom; Peter Sajosi; Andrew Briggs; Vijayveer Bonthapally; Brentuximab vedotin in relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma post-autologous stem cell transplant: a cost-effectiveness analysis in Scotland, J Med Econ, 2017 Jan; 20(1):1369-6998; 8-18",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Brentuximab vedotin (1.8mg/kg IV once every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Multi-agent chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy without follow-up allogeneic stem cell translplant,Model specifically from Scottish patient perspective and in line with the the SG035-0003 trial that evaluated brentuximab vedotin in patients who have failed high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant,77 Years,15 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,38769,United Kingdom,2013,67371.33

16837,Cost utility analysis of endoscopic sinus surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyposis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) compared to medical therapy for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) with and without nasal polyposis (NP). STUDY DESIGN: Cohort-style Markov decision-tree economic model with a 36-year time horizon. METHODS: Two cohorts of 229 CRS patients with and without NP who underwent ESS were compared with a matched cohort of 229 CRS patients from the Medical Expenditures Survey Panel database (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, Rockville, MD) who underwent medical management. Utility scores were calculated from sequential patient responses to the EuroQol five-dimensions questionnaire. Decision-tree analysis and a 10-state Markov model utilized published event probabilities and primary data to calculate long-term costs and utility. The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Thorough sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The reference case for CRS with NP yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ESS versus medical therapy of $5,687.41/QALY. The reference case for CRS without NP yielded an ICER of $5,405.44/QALY. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve in both cases demonstrated 95% certainty that the ESS strategy was the most cost-effective option at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000/QALY or higher. These results were robust to one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of ESS compared to medical therapy alone for the management of CRS patients both with and without NP.

However, the literature pertaining to lumbar interlaminar epidural injections is lacking, specifically in reference to cost utility analysis derived from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a pragmatic approach in a practical setting. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost utility of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections in managing chronic low back and/or lower extremity pain secondary to lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and axial or discogenic low back pain. STUDY DESIGN: Analysis based on 3 previously published randomized trials of effectiveness of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections assessing their role in disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and axial or discogenic pain. SETTING: A contemporary, private, specialty referral interventional pain management center in the United States. METHODS: Cost utility of lumbar interlaminar epidural injections with or without steroids in managing lumbar disc herniation, central spinal stenosis, and discogenic or axial low back pain was conducted with data derived from 3 RCTs that included a 2-year follow-up, with inclusion of 360 patients. The primary outcome was significant improvement defined as at least a 50% in pain reduction and disability status. Direct payment data from 2016 was utilized for assessment of procedural costs. Overall costs, including drug costs, were determined by multiplication of direct procedural payment data by a factor of 1.4 to accommodate for indirect payments respectively for disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain. RESULTS: The results of 3 RCTs showed direct cost utility for one year of quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of $2,050.87 for disc herniation, $2,112.25 for axial or discogenic pain without disc herniation, and $1,773.28 for spinal stenosis, with an average cost per one year QALY of $1,976.58, with total estimated costs of $2,871.22, $2,057.15, $2482.59, and $2761.21 respectively. LIMITATIONS: The limitation of this cost utility analysis includes that it is a single center evaluation, even though 360 patients were included in this analysis. Further, only the costs of interventional procedures and physician visits were assessed based on the data, with extrapolation of indirect costs presenting the overall total costs.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate LF progression in HCV and ALD for a cohort of 40-year-old men with abnormal levels of transaminases. Three different testing alternatives were studied: a single liver biopsy; annual Enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) followed by liver stiffness measurement (LSM) imaging as a confirmation test if the ELF test is positive; and annual ELF test without LSM. The analysis was performed from the perspective of a university hospital in Spain. Clinical data were obtained from published literature. Costs were sourced from administrative databases of the hospital. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In HCV patients, annual sequential ELF test/LSM and annual ELF test alone prevented respectively 12.9 and 13.3 liver fibrosis-related deaths per 100 persons tested, compared to biopsy.

16854,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Corneal Collagen Crosslinking for Progressive Keratoconus,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of corneal collagen crosslinking (CXL) for progressive keratoconus from the healthcare payer''s perspective. DESIGN: A probabilistic Markov-type model using data from published clinical trials and cohort studies. PARTICIPANTS: Two identical cohorts, each comprising 1000 virtual patients with progressive bilateral keratoconus, were modeled; one cohort underwent CXL and the other cohort received no intervention. METHODS: Both cohorts were modeled and evaluated annually over a lifetime. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total cost, disease progression, and the probability of corneal transplantation, graft failure, or both were calculated based on data from published trials and cohort studies. These outcomes were compared between the 2 cohorts. In our base scenario, the stabilizing effect of CXL was assumed to be 10 years; however, longer durations also were analyzed. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), defined as euros per QALY. RESULTS: Assuming a 10-year effect of CXL, the ICER was euro54 384/QALY ($59 822/QALY). When we adjusted the effect of CXL to a lifelong stabilizing effect, the ICER decreased to euro10 149/QALY ($11 163/QALY). Other sensitivity and scenario analyses that had a relevant impact on ICER included the discount rate, visual acuity before CXL, and healthcare costs. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal collagen crosslinking for progressive keratoconus is cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times the current gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Moreover, a longer stabilizing effect of CXL increases cost effectiveness. If CXL had a stabilizing effect on keratoconus of 15 years or longer, then the ICER would be less than the 1 x GDP per capita threshold and thus very cost effective.",2017-01-23098,28532974,Ophthalmology,Daniel A Godefrooij,2017,/,,No,28532974,"Daniel A Godefrooij; Marie-Josee J Mangen; Elsie Chan; David P S O'Brart; Saskia M Imhof; G Ardine de Wit; Robert P L Wisse; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Corneal Collagen Crosslinking for Progressive Keratoconus, Ophthalmology, 2017 May 19; ():0161-6420",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Corneal Collagen Crosslinking vs. None,Simulated cohort with progressive bilateral keratoconus,22 Years,22 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 10 years",3.00,3.00,10149,Euro,2015,12298.25
16855,Cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole compared with piperacillin/tazobactam as empiric therapy for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections based on the in-vitro surveillance of bacterial isolates in the UK,"AIMS: An increase in the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative pathogens has been noted recently.[1] A challenge in empiric treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) is identifying initial appropriate antibiotic therapy, which is associated with reduced length of stay and mortality compared with inappropriate therapy. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole compared with piperacillin/tazobactam (commonly used in this indication) in the treatment of patients with cIAI in United Kingdom (UK) hospitals. METHODS: A decision-analytic Monte Carlo simulation model was used to compare costs (antibiotic and hospitalization costs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of patients infected with gram-negative cIAI and treated empirically with either ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole or piperacillin/tazobactam. Bacterial isolates were randomly drawn from the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS) database, a surveillance database of non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected from patients in the UK infected with gram-negative pathogens. Susceptibility to initial empiric therapy was based on the measured susceptibilities reported in the PACTS database. RESULTS: Ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole was cost-effective when compared with piperacillin/tazobactam with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound4,350/QALY and 0.36 hospitalisation days/patient saved. Costs in the ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole arm were pound2,576/patient compared with pound2,168/patient in the piperacillin/tazobactam arm. The ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole arm experienced a greater number of QALYs than the piperacillin/tazobactam arm (14.31/patient vs. 14.21/patient, respectively). Ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole remained cost-effective in one-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Economic models can help to identify the appropriate choice of empiric therapy for the treatment of cIAI. Results indicated that empiric use of ceftolozane/tazobactam+metronidazole is cost-effective versus piperacillin/tazobactam in UK patients with cIAI at risk of resistant infection.

16856,Cost effectiveness of omalizumab add-on to standard-of-care therapy in patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma in a Brazilian healthcare setting,"OBJECTIVE: Omalizumab add-on to standard-of-care therapy has proven to be efficacious in severe asthma patients for whom exacerbations cannot be controlled otherwise. Moreover, evidence from different healthcare settings suggests reduced healthcare resource utilization with omalizumab. Based on these findings, we aimed to assess the cost effectiveness of the addition of omalizumab to standard-of-care therapy in patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma in a Brazilian healthcare setting. METHODS: A previously published Markov model was adapted using Brazil-specific unit costs to compare the costs and outcomes of the addition of omalizumab to standard-of-care therapy versus standard-of-care therapy alone. Model inputs were largely based on the eXpeRience study. Costs and health outcomes were calculated for lifetime-years and were annually discounted at 5%. Both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: An additional cost of R$280,400 for 5.20 additional quality-adjusted life-years was estimated with the addition of omalizumab to standard-of-care therapy, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R$53,890. One-way sensitivity analysis indicated that discount rates, standard-of-care therapy exacerbation rates, and exacerbation-related mortality rates had the largest impact on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. LIMITATIONS: Assumptions of lifetime treatment adherence and rate of future exacerbations independent of previous events might affect the findings. Lack of Brazilian patients in the eXpeRience study may affect the findings, although sample size and baseline characteristics suggest that the modelled population closely resembles Brazilian severe allergic asthma patients. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that omalizumab as an add-on therapy is more cost-effective than standard-of-care therapy alone for Brazilian patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma, based on the World Health Organization''s cost-effectiveness threshold of up to 3 times the gross domestic product.",2017-01-23101,28532191,J Med Econ,Cibele Suzuki,2017,/,1-15,Yes,28532191,"Cibele Suzuki; Nilceia Lopes da Silva; Praveen Kumar; Purnima Pathak; Siew Hwa Ong; Cost effectiveness of omalizumab add-on to standard-of-care therapy in patients with uncontrolled severe allergic asthma in a Brazilian healthcare setting, J Med Econ, 2017 May 22; ():1369-6998; 1-15",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Standard-of-care therapy+omalizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care,"The Brazilian population with severe, allergic, uncontrolled asthma",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,53890,Brazil,2015,17943.68
16857,Potential health gains for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma in daily clinical practice: A real-world cost-effectiveness analysis of sequential first- and second-line treatments,"INTRODUCTION: Randomised controlled trials have shown that targeted therapies like sunitinib are effective in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Little is known about the current use of these therapies, and their associated costs and effects in daily clinical practice. We estimated the real-world cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies comprising one or more sequentially administered drugs. METHODS: Analyses were performed using patient-level data from a Dutch population-based registry including patients diagnosed with primary mRCC from January 2008 to December 2010 (i.e., treated between 2008 and 2013). The full disease course of these patients was estimated using a patient-level simulation model based on regression analyses of the registry data. A healthcare sector perspective was adopted; total costs included healthcare costs related to mRCC. Cost-effectiveness was expressed in cost per life-year and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the overall uncertainty surrounding cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: In current daily practice, 54% (336/621) of all patients was treated with targeted therapies. Most patients (84%; 282/336) received sunitinib as first-line therapy. Of the patients receiving first-line therapy, 30% (101/336) also received second-line therapy; the majority was treated with everolimus (40%, 40/101) or sorafenib (28%, 28/101). Current treatment practice (including patients not receiving targeted therapy) led to 0.807 QALYs; mean costs were euro58,912. This resulted in an additional euro105,011 per QALY gained compared to not using targeted therapy at all. Forty-six percent of all patients received no targeted therapy; of these patients, 24% (69/285) was eligible for sunitinib. If these patients were treated with first-line sunitinib, mean QALYs would improve by 0.062-0.076 (where the range reflects the choice of second-line therapy). This improvement is completely driven by the health gain seen amongst patients eligible to receive sunitinib but did not receive it, who gain 0.558-0.684 QALYs from sunitinib. Since additional costs would be euro7,072-9,913, incremental costs per QALY gained are euro93,107-111,972 compared to current practice. DISCUSSION: Health can be gained if more treatment-eligible patients receive targeted therapies. Moreover, it will be just as cost-effective to treat these patients with sunitinib as current treatment practice.",2017-01-23103,28531203,PLoS One,S De Groot,2017,12 / 5,e0177364,No,28531203,"S De Groot; H M Blommestein; W K Redekop; S Sleijfer; L A L M Kiemeney; E Oosterwijk; C A Uyl-de Groot; Potential health gains for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma in daily clinical practice: A real-world cost-effectiveness analysis of sequential first- and second-line treatments, PLoS One , 2017; 12(5):1932-6203; e0177364",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Real-world treatment mix vs. no targeted therapy,Not Stated,97 Years,23 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,105011,Euro,2014,152650.19
16858,Cost-effectiveness of strategies to increase cervical screening uptake at first invitation (STRATEGIC),"Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of strategies to increase cervical cancer screening uptake at first invitation (STRATEGIC trial). Methods We performed an economic analysis alongside the STRATEGIC trial, comparing each of seven novel interventions for improving cervical screening uptake with control general practices in Greater Manchester and Grampian (United Kingdom). A template was developed to measure the intervention costs. Trial estimates of screening uptake were combined with data from the literature to estimate healthcare costs of each intervention. The added lifetime costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of attending cervical screening were estimated by a systematic literature review, with relevant results pooled and weighted by study quality.

16865,Clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of brief guided parent-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy and solution-focused brief therapy for treatment of childhood anxiety disorders: a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Half of all lifetime anxiety disorders emerge before age 12 years; however, access to evidence-based psychological therapies for affected children is poor. We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of two brief psychological treatments for children with anxiety referred to routine child mental health settings. We hypothesised that brief guided parent-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) would be associated with better clinical outcomes than solution-focused brief therapy and would be cost-effective. METHODS: We did this randomised controlled trial at four National Health Service primary child and mental health services in Oxfordshire, UK. Children aged 5-12 years referred for anxiety difficulties were randomly allocated (1:1), via a secure online minimisation tool, to receive brief guided parent-delivered CBT or solution-focused brief therapy, with minimisation for age, sex, anxiety severity, and level of parental anxiety. The allocation sequence was not accessible to the researcher enrolling participants or to study assessors. Research staff who obtained outcome measurements were masked to group allocation and clinical staff who delivered the intervention did not measure outcomes. The primary outcome was recovery, on the basis of Clinical Global Impressions of Improvement (CGI-I). Parents recorded patient-level resource use. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for use in cost-utility analysis were derived from the Child Health Utility 9D. Assessments were done at baseline (before randomisation), after treatment (primary endpoint), and 6 months after treatment completion. We did analysis by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the ISCRTN registry, number ISRCTN07627865. FINDINGS: Between March 23, 2012, and March 31, 2014, we randomly assigned 136 patients to receive brief guided parent-delivered CBT (n=68) or solution-focused brief therapy (n=68). At the primary endpoint assessment (June, 2012, to September, 2014), 40 (59%) children in the brief guided parent-delivered CBT group versus 47 (69%) children in the solution-focused brief therapy group had an improvement of much or very much in CGI-I score, with no significant differences between groups in either clinical (CGI-I: relative risk 1.01, 95% CI 0.86-1.19; p=0.95) or economic (QALY: mean difference 0.006, -0.009 to 0.02; p=0.42) outcome measures. However, brief guided parent-delivered CBT was associated with lower costs (mean difference - pound448; 95% CI -934 to 37; p=0.070) and, taking into account sampling uncertainty, was likely to represent a cost-effective use of resources compared with solution-focused brief therapy. No treatment-related or trial-related adverse events were reported in either group. INTERPRETATION: Our findings show no evidence of clinical superiority of brief guided parent-delivered CBT. However, guided parent-delivered CBT is likely to be a cost-effective alternative to solution-focused brief therapy and might be considered as a first-line treatment for children with anxiety problems.

16866,Modeling the Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of IDegLira in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Who are Failing To Meet Glycemic Targets on Basal Insulin Alone in The Netherlands,"INTRODUCTION: Insulin degludec/liraglutide (IDegLira) is the first basal insulin and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in a single pen injection device, and a once-daily treatment option for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who are uncontrolled on basal insulin and require treatment intensification. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of IDegLira versus basal-bolus therapy (insulin glargine U100 + 3x daily insulin aspart) for patients with T2DM uncontrolled on basal insulin [HbA1c >53 mmol/mol (>7%)] in the Netherlands. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the validated IMS CORE Diabetes Model from a healthcare payer perspective. Outcomes were modeled over patient lifetimes in a cohort with baseline characteristics from the DUAL II trial. Treatment effect data were sourced from a statistical indirect comparison (pooled analysis) of IDegLira with basal-bolus therapy. RESULTS: Treatment with IDegLira resulted in mean increases in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.43 quality-adjusted life years versus basal-bolus therapy. Improved clinical outcomes resulted from fewer diabetes-related complications and a delayed time to their onset. IDegLira was associated with lower costs of EUR 4679 versus basal-bolus therapy, a result of lower pharmacy costs and avoided diabetes-related complications. Thus, IDegLira was dominant, i.e., both more effective and less costly than basal-bolus therapy. CONCLUSIONS: IDegLira is an effective treatment option to improve glycemic control without incurring an increased risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain.

16867,Cost-utility analysis of certolizumab pegol in combination with methotrexate in patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis in Greece,"We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of certolizumab pegol (CZP), a pegylated fc-free anti-TNF, as add-on therapy to methotrexate (MTX) versus etanercept, adalimumab, or golimumab in patients with moderate-to-severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) not responding to the conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs). A Markov model (6-month cycle length) assessed health and cost outcomes of CZP versus other anti-TNFs recommended for RA in Greece over a patient''s lifetime. Following discontinuation of first-line anti-TNF, patients switched to second anti-TNF and then to a biologic with another mode of action. Sequential use of csDMARDs followed third biologic. Clinical data and utilities were extracted from published literature. Analysis was conducted from third-party payer perspective in Greece. Costs (drug acquisition, administration, monitoring, and patient management) were considered for 2014. Results presented are incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) ascertained robustness of base-case findings. Base-case analysis indicated that CZP+MTX was more costly and more effective compared with Etanercept+MTX (base-case ICER: euro3,177 per QALY), whilst versus adalimumab/golimumab, CZP was dominant (less costly, more effective). For all comparisons, CZP treatment resulted in greater improvements in life expectancy and QALYs. PSA indicated that at the willingness-to-pay threshold of euro34,000/QALY, CZP+MTX was associated with a 71.6, 97.9, or 99.2% probability of being cost-effective versus etanercept, golimumab, or adalimumab, respectively, in combination with MTX.

16870,Cost-effectiveness analysis of rivaroxaban for treatment and secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Until recently, standard treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) concerned a combination of short-term low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and long-term vitamin-K antagonist (VKA). Risk of bleeding and the requirement for regular anticoagulation monitoring are, however, limiting their use. Rivaroxaban is a novel oral anticoagulant associated with a significantly lower risk of major bleeds (hazard ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.37-0.79) compared to LMWH/VKA therapy and does not require regular anticoagulation monitoring. AIMS: To evaluate the health economic consequences of treating acute VTE patients with rivaroxaban compared to treatment with LMWH/VKA, viewed from the Dutch societal perspective. METHODS: A life-time Markov model was populated with the findings of the EINSTEIN phase III clinical trial to analyze cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban therapy in treatment and prevention of VTE from a Dutch societal perspective. Primary model outcomes were total and incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), as well as life expectancy and costs. RESULTS: Over a patient''s life-time, rivaroxaban was shown to be dominant, with health gains of 0.047 QALYs and cost savings of euro304 compared to LMWH/VKA therapy. Dominance was robustly present in all sensitivity analyses. Major drivers of the differences between the two treatment arms were related to anticoagulation monitoring (medical costs, travel costs, and loss of productivity) and the occurrence of major bleeds.

16872,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C treatment using generic direct-acting antivirals available in India,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Availability of directly-acting antivirals (DAAs) has changed the treatment landscape of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The high price of DAAs has restricted their use in several countries. However, in some countries such as India, generic DAAs are available at much cheaper price. This study examined whether generic DAAs could be cost-saving and how long it would take for the treatment to become cost-saving/effective. METHODS: A previously-validated, mathematical model was adapted to the HCV-infected population in India to compare the outcomes of no treatment versus treatment with DAAs. Model parameters were estimated from published studies. Cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment using available DAAs was calculated, using a payer''s perspective. We estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DAAs versus no treatment. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Compared with no treatment, the use of generic DAAs in Indian HCV patients would increase the life expectancy by 8.02 years, increase QALYs by 3.89, avert 19.07 DALYs, and reduce the lifetime healthcare costs by $1,309 per-person treated. Treatment became cost-effective within 2 years, and cost-saving within 10 years of its initiation overall and within 5 years in persons with cirrhosis. Treating 10,000 HCV-infected persons could prevent 3400-3850 decompensated cirrhosis, 1800-2500 HCC, and 4000-4550 liver-related deaths. The results were sensitive to the costs of DAAs, pre- and post-treatment diagnostic tests and management of cirrhosis, and quality of life after sustained virologic response.

16878,Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis C treatment using generic direct-acting antivirals available in India,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Availability of directly-acting antivirals (DAAs) has changed the treatment landscape of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The high price of DAAs has restricted their use in several countries. However, in some countries such as India, generic DAAs are available at much cheaper price. This study examined whether generic DAAs could be cost-saving and how long it would take for the treatment to become cost-saving/effective. METHODS: A previously-validated, mathematical model was adapted to the HCV-infected population in India to compare the outcomes of no treatment versus treatment with DAAs. Model parameters were estimated from published studies. Cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment using available DAAs was calculated, using a payer''s perspective. We estimated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), total costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of DAAs versus no treatment. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Compared with no treatment, the use of generic DAAs in Indian HCV patients would increase the life expectancy by 8.02 years, increase QALYs by 3.89, avert 19.07 DALYs, and reduce the lifetime healthcare costs by $1,309 per-person treated. Treatment became cost-effective within 2 years, and cost-saving within 10 years of its initiation overall and within 5 years in persons with cirrhosis. Treating 10,000 HCV-infected persons could prevent 3400-3850 decompensated cirrhosis, 1800-2500 HCC, and 4000-4550 liver-related deaths.

16881,Economic evaluation of strategies for restarting anticoagulation therapy after a first event of unprovoked venous thromboembolism,"BACKGROUND: Following at least three months of anticoagulation therapy after a first unprovoked Venous Thromboembolism (VTE), there is uncertainty about the duration of therapy. Further anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of having a potentially fatal recurrent VTE but at the expense of a higher risk of bleeding which can also be fatal. OBJECTIVE: An economic evaluation sought to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of using a decision rule for restarting anticoagulation therapy versus no extension of therapy in patients based on their risk of a further unprovoked VTE. METHODS: A Markov patient-level simulation model was developed which adopted a lifetime time horizon with monthly time cycles and was from a UK National Health Service (NHS) /Personal Social Services (PSS) perspective. RESULTS: Base case model results suggest that treating patients with a predicted one year VTE risk of 17.5% or higher may be cost-effective if decision makers are willing to pay up to pound20,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained. However probabilistic sensitivity analysis show the model was highly sensitive to overall parameter uncertainty and warrants caution in selecting the optimal decision rule on cost-effectiveness grounds. Univariate sensitivity analyses indicate variables such as anticoagulation therapy disutility and mortality risks were very influential for driving model results. CONCLUSION: This represents the first economic model to consider the use of a decision rule for restarting therapy for unprovoked VTE patients.

Further anticoagulation therapy reduces the risk of having a potentially fatal recurrent VTE but at the expense of a higher risk of bleeding which can also be fatal. OBJECTIVE: An economic evaluation sought to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of using a decision rule for restarting anticoagulation therapy versus no extension of therapy in patients based on their risk of a further unprovoked VTE.

RESULTS: Base case model results suggest that treating patients with a predicted one year VTE risk of 17.5% or higher may be cost-effective if decision makers are willing to pay up to pound20,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained.

16893,Cost-effectiveness of mirabegron compared to tolterodine ER 4 mg for overactive bladder in Canada,"INTRODUCTION: This analysis compared the cost-effectiveness of once-daily regimens of mirabegron 50 mg and generic tolterodine ER 4 mg in a hypothetical cohort of previously treated patients with overactive bladder (OAB) in Canada. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to represent different health states according to OAB symptoms (frequency, incontinence), presence/absence of adverse events (AEs; dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision), and treatment status (on-treatment, discontinue treatment, restart previous treatment). The time horizon used was one year, with monthly transitions between health states. The model was populated using data from a phase 3, placebo-controlled trial of mirabegron that included tolterodine as an active comparator (SCORPIO), as well as other published literature and expert opinion. Cost-effectiveness was calculated from Canadian public payer (based on Quebec list prices) and societal perspectives. RESULTS: The incremental one-year cost per patient for mirabegron over tolterodine was $182 CAD and $157 CAD from the payer and societal perspectives, respectively. The incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain for mirabegron was 0.0066 when using EQ-5D health-state utilities. Mirabegron was cost-effective compared with tolterodine, from both payer and societal perspectives, and remained cost-effective vs. tolterodine across the majority of sensitivity analyses. The model was based on limited clinical trial evidence supplemented with expert opinion and assumptions; a select number of OAB symptoms, AEs, and direct and indirect medical costs associated with OAB; and a timeframe of only one year.

16895,Cost-effectiveness evaluation of aspirin in primary prevention of myocardial infarction amongst males with average cardiovascular risk in Iran,"Aspirin is one of the certified medicines commonly used for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI). Aspirin side effects and gastrointestinal bleeding, in particular, have arisen debates on its use for the primary prevention of MI. The present research evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the use of aspirin in the primary prevention of MI among Iranian men with average cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, using Markov modeling technique. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) estimated to be 864 USA dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and 782 USD per life years gained (LYG) for each patient in the base-case scenario (public tariffs and no discounting). This research proves cost-effectiveness of the use of aspirin in the primary prevention of MI in targeted population, since the assessed ICERs are quite under the recommended threshold by WHO which is one gross domestic product (GDP) per capita ($5315.1 for Iran in 2015).",2017-01-23131,28515767,Res Pharm Sci,Mohammadreza Amirsadri,2017,12 / 2,144-153,No,28515767,"Mohammadreza Amirsadri; Mohammad Javad Sedighi; Cost-effectiveness evaluation of aspirin in primary prevention of myocardial infarction amongst males with average cardiovascular risk in Iran, Res Pharm Sci, 2017 Apr; 12(2):1735-5362; 144-153",QALY,Iran,Not Stated,Not Stated,Aspirin 80 mg vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,45 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1653,United States,2015,1805
16896,Cost-effectiveness of telehealthcare to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: results from the Danish 'TeleCare North' cluster-randomised trial,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of a telehealthcare solution in addition to usual care compared with usual care. DESIGN: A 12-month cost-utility analysis conducted alongside a cluster-randomised trial. SETTING: Community-based setting in the geographical area of North Denmark Region in Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 26 municipality districts define randomisation clusters with 13 districts in each arm. 1225 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were enrolled, of which 578 patients were randomised to telehealthcare and 647 to usual care. INTERVENTIONS: In addition to usual care, patients in the intervention group received a set of telehealthcare equipment and were monitored by a municipality-based healthcare team. Patients in the control group received usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-years gained from baseline up to 12 months follow-up. RESULTS: From a healthcare and social sector perspective, the adjusted mean difference in total costs between telehealthcare and usual care was euro728 (95% CI -754 to 2211) and the adjusted mean difference in quality-adjusted life-years gained was 0.0132 (95% CI -0.0083 to 0.0346). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was euro55 327 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Decision-makers should be willing to pay more than euro55 000 to achieve a probability of cost-effectiveness >50%. This conclusion is robust to changes in the definition of hospital contacts and reduced intervention costs. Only in the most optimistic scenario combining the effects of all sensitivity analyses, does the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio fall below the UK thresholds values (euro21 068 per quality-adjusted life-year). CONCLUSIONS: Telehealthcare is unlikely to be a cost-effective addition to usual care, if it is offered to all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and if the willingness-to-pay threshold values from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence are applied.

16897,Do men and women need to be screened differently with faecal immunochemical testing? A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Several studies suggest test characteristics for the faecal immunochemical test (FIT) differ by gender, triggering a debate whether men and women should be screened differently. We used the microsimulation model MISCAN-Colon to evaluate whether screening stratified by gender is cost-effective. METHODS: We estimated gender-specific FIT characteristics based on first round positivity and detection rates observed in a FIT screening pilot (CORERO-1). Subsequently, we used the model to estimate harms, benefits and costs of 480 gender-specific FIT screening strategies and compared them with uniform screening. RESULTS: Biennial FIT screening from age 50-75 was less effective in women than men (35.7 versus 49.0 QALYs gained, respectively) at higher costs (euro42,161 versus -euro5,471 respectively). However, the incremental QALYs gained and costs and of annual screening compared to biennial screening were more similar for both gender (8.7 QALYs gained and euro26,394 for women versus 6.7 QALYs gained and euro20,863 for men). Considering all evaluated screening strategies, optimal gender-based screening yielded at most 7% more QALYs gained than optimal uniform screening and even resulted in equal costs and QALYs gained from a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro1300. CONCLUSIONS: FIT screening is less effective in women, but the incremental cost-effectiveness is similar in men and women.
