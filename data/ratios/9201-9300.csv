9201,Screening Based on Risk for Colorectal Cancer Is the Most Cost-Effective Approach,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Performing single endoscopic examinations or selective screening based on risk might be more practical than recommended screening strategies for colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated the cost effectiveness of these strategies, under real-life conditions of suboptimal compliance, and the societal cost perspective. METHODS: We used Markov modeling to analyze data from 787,000 individuals in Singapore, aged 50 to 75 years, with an age-standardized rate of CRC of 30 to 40/100,000 in 2009. Potential outcomes, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and net health benefit were compared between single sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy and current recommended screening strategies, and also with a strategy of selective screening based on risk of CRC. RESULTS: Performing single sigmoidoscopies on individuals when they are 60 years old was the cheapest screening strategy; it would reduce CRC incidence by 19% and mortality by 16%, compared with no screening. A single colonoscopy is less cost effective than a single sigmoidoscopy, unless the proportion of right-sided lesions exceeds 65%. The fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) had the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio when all strategies were compared with no screening; iFOBT and colonoscopic examinations every 10 years each had extended dominance over other strategies. Screening subjects 50 to 60 years old by iFOBT and subjects 60 to 72 years old with colonoscopies every 10 years was the most cost-effective strategy (US$25,000/quality-adjusted life-years). Risk for CRC, adherence, and cost of colonoscopy were the main determinants of cost effectiveness, based on sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Markov modeling analysis indicates that selectively screening individuals for CRC based on risk is the most cost-effective approach; it limits the cost and number of colonoscopies needed and significantly reduces CRC mortality.",2012-01-08319,22100624,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,Yock Young Dan,2012,/,,No,22100624,"Yock Young Dan; Benjamin Y S Chuah; Dean C S Koh; Khay Guan Yeoh; Screening Based on Risk for Colorectal Cancer Is the Most Cost-Effective Approach, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, ; ():1542-3565",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Single sigmoidoscopy at age 60 for colorectal cancer screening vs. None,Not Stated,75 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,23666.67,United States,2010,28090

9210,Adding docetaxel to cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with unresectable head and neck cancer: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Adding docetaxel (Taxotere, T) to induction chemotherapy with platinum/infusional 5-FU (PF) has been shown to improve overall survival of patients with head and neck cancer. The aim of the study was to analyze the cost-utility of TPF in patients with unresectable disease.Design: We developed a Markov model to represent patient's weekly transitions among different health states, related to treatment or disease status. Transition probabilities were obtained from the TAX 324 clinical trial report and from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 24971/TAX 323 raw data. Costs were estimated in Italy from a Regional Healthcare System perspective. A 5-year temporal horizon was adopted and a 3.5% yearly discount rate was applied. RESULTS: When compared with PF, TPF treatment increases life expectancy by 0.33 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) in TAX 323 and 0.41 QALYs in TAX 324. The benefit was achieved at a cost of ?11?822/QALY for TAX 323 and ?6757/QALY for TAX 324. Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis showed that 69% (TAX 323) and 99% (TAX 324) of the results lie below the threshold of ?50?000/QALY saved. CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis, TPF induction chemotherapy proved to be cost-effective when compared with PF, having a cost-utility ratio comparable to other widely accepted healthcare interventions.",2012-01-08326,22104577,Ann Oncol,N L Liberato,2012,23 / 7,,No,22104577,"N L Liberato; C Rognoni; S Rubrichi; S Quaglini; M Marchetti; T Gorlia; L Licitra; J B Vermorken; Adding docetaxel to cisplatin and fluorouracil in patients with unresectable head and neck cancer: a cost-utility analysis, Ann Oncol, ; 23(7):0923-7534",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Addition of docetaxel to cisplatin and platinum/infusional 5-fluorouracil (TPF) vs. Chemotherapy plus platinum/infusional 5-fluorouracil (PF),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,11822,Euro,2010,18569.87

Results were similar whether or not a universal influenza immunization program was used in other age groups; projections were robust in the face of wide-ranging sensitivity analyses.Based on the best available data, it is projected that replacement of traditional trivalent influenza vaccines with MF59-adjuvanted vaccines would confer substantial benefits to vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and would be economically attractive relative to other widely-used preventive interventions.",2012-01-08332,22110645,PLoS One,David N Fisman,2011,6 /,e27420,No,22110645,"David N Fisman; Ashleigh R Tuite; Estimation of the health impact and cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccination with enhanced effectiveness in Canada, PLoS One , ; 6 ():1932-6203; e27420",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Immunization of older adults with adjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccine (ATIV) vs. Immunization with trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,2111,Canada,2009,2241.92

9238,Historical clinical and economic consequences of anemia management in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis using erythropoietin stimulating agents versus routine blood transfusions: a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis,"Abstract Objective: To determine whether Medicare's decision to cover routine administration of erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) to treat anemia of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been a cost-effective policy relative to standard of care at the time. Methods: The authors used summary statistics from the actual cohort of ESRD patients receiving ESAs between 1995 and 2004 to create a simulated patient cohort, which was compared with a comparable simulated cohort assumed to rely solely on blood transfusions. Outcomes modeled from the Medicare perspective included estimated treatment costs, life-years gained, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated relative to the hypothetical reference case of no ESA use in the transfusion cohort. Sensitivity of the results to model assumptions was tested using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Estimated total costs incurred by the ESRD population were $155.47B for the cohort receiving ESAs and $155.22B for the cohort receiving routine blood transfusions. Estimated QALYs were 2.56M and 2.29M, respectively, for the two groups. The ICER of ESAs compared to routine blood transfusions was estimated as $873 per QALY gained. The model was sensitive to a number of parameters according to one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Limitations: This model was counter-factual as the actual comparison group, whose anemia was managed via transfusion and iron supplements, rapidly disappeared following introduction of ESAs. In addition, a large number of model parameters were obtained from observational studies due to the lack of randomized trial evidence in the literature. Conclusions: This study indicates that Medicare's coverage of ESAs appears to have been cost effective based on commonly accepted levels of willingness-to-pay. The ESRD population achieved substantial clinical benefit at a reasonable cost to society.",2012-01-08340,22115328,J Med Econ,Huseyin Naci,2012,/,,Yes,22115328,"Huseyin Naci; Gregory de Lissovoy; Christopher Hollenbeak; Brian Custer; Axel Hofmann; William McClellan; Matthew Gitlin; Historical clinical and economic consequences of anemia management in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis using erythropoietin stimulating agents versus routine blood transfusions: a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis, J Med Econ, ; ():1369-6998",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) for treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure vs. Blood transfusion,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,873,United States,2008,1049.41

9245,Cost-Effectiveness of Minimally Invasive Versus Open Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion for Degenerative Spondylolisthesis Associated Low-Back and Leg Pain Over Two Years,"OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) for lumbar spondylolisthesis allows for surgical treatment of back and leg pain while theoretically minimizing tissue injury and accelerating overall recovery. Although the authors of previous studies have demonstrated shorter length of hospital stay and reduced blood loss with MIS versus open-TLIF, short- and long-term outcomes have been equivocal. No studies to date have evaluated the comprehensive health care costs associated with TLIF procedures or assessed the cost-utility of MIS- versus open-TLIF. As such, we set out to assess previously unstudied end points of health care cost and cost-utility associated with MIS- versus open-TLIF. METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing MIS-TLIF (n = 15) or open-TLIF (n = 15) for grade I degenerative spondylolisthesis associated back and leg pain were prospectively studied. Total back-related medical resource use, missed work, and health-state values (quality-adjusted life years [QALYs], calculated from EQ-5D with U.S. valuation) were assessed after two-year follow-up. Two-year resource use was multiplied by unit costs on the basis of Medicare national allowable payment amounts (direct cost) and work-day losses were multiplied by the self-reported gross-of-tax wage rate (indirect cost). Difference in mean total cost per QALY gained for MIS- versus open-TLIF was assessed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER: COSTmis - COSTopen/QALYmis - QALYopen). RESULTS: MIS versus open-TLIF cohorts were similar at baseline. By two years postoperatively, patients undergoing MIS- versus open-TLIF reported similar mean QALYs gained (0.50 vs. 0.41, P = 0.17). Mean total two-year cost of MIS- and open-TLIF was $35,996 and $44,727, respectively. The $8,731 two-year cost savings of MIS- versus open-TLIF did not reach statistical significance (P= 0.18) for this sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Although our limited sample size prevented statistical significance, MIS- versus open-TLIF was associated with reduced costs over two years while providing equivalent improvement in QALYs. MIS-TLIF allows patients to leave the hospital sooner, achieve narcotic independence sooner, and return to work sooner than open-TLIF. In our experience, MIS- versus open-TLIF is a cost reducing technology in the surgical treatment of medically refractory low-back and leg pain from grade I lumbar spondylolisthesis.",2012-01-08348,22120269,World Neurosurg,Scott L Parker,2012,78 / 1-2,,No,22120269,"Scott L Parker; Owoicho Adogwa; Ali Bydon; Joseph Cheng; Matthew J McGirt; Cost-Effectiveness of Minimally Invasive Versus Open Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion for Degenerative Spondylolisthesis Associated Low-Back and Leg Pain Over Two Years, World Neurosurg , ; 78(1-2):1878-8750",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) surgery vs. Open transforaminal lumber interbody fusion (TLIF) surgery,Not Stated,70 Years,17 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-97011.11,United States,2009,-117031.29

PURPOSE To assess the economic value of sunitinib as fi rst-line therapy in mRCC within the Spanish healthcare system. METHODS An adapted Markov model with a 10-year time horizon was used to analyse the cost effectiveness of sunitinib vs. sorafenib (SFN) and bevacizumab/interferon-a (BEV/IFN) as first-line mRCC therapy from the Spanish third-party payer perspective. Progression-free survival (PFS) and OS data from sunitinib, SFN and BEV/IFN pivotal trials were extrapolated to project survival and costs in 6-week cycles. Results, in progression-free life-years (PFLY), life years (LY) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, expressed as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) with costs and benefits discounted annually at 3%, were obtained using deterministic and probabilistic analyses. RESULTS Sunitinib was more effective and less costly than both SFN (gains of 0.52 PFLY, 0.16 LY, 0.17 QALY) and BEV/IFN (gains of 0.19 PFLY, 0.23 LY, 0.16 QALY) with average cost savings/patients of ?1,124 and ?23,218, respectively. Using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of ?50,000/QALY, sunitinib achieved an incremental net benefit (INB) of ?9,717 and ?31,211 compared with SFN and BEV/IFN, respectively.

At this WTP, the probability of sunitinib providing the highest INB was 75%.

9248,A cost-effectiveness model of genetic testing for the evaluation of families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"BackgroundTraditional management of families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) involves periodic lifetime clinical screening of family members, an approach that does not identify all gene carriers owing to incomplete penetrance and significant clinical heterogeneity. Limitations in availability and cost have meant genetic testing is not part of routine clinical management for many HCM families.ObjectiveTo determine the cost-effectiveness of the addition of genetic testing to HCM family management, compared with clinical screening alone.MethodsA probabilistic Markov decision model was used to determine cost per quality-adjusted life-year and cost for each life-year gained when genetic testing is included in the management of Australian families with HCM, compared with the conventional approach of periodic clinical screening alone.ResultsThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $A785 (?510 or ?587) per quality-adjusted life-year gained, and $A12?720 (?8261 or ?9509) per additional life-year gained making genetic testing a very cost-effective strategy. Sensitivity analyses showed that the cost of proband genetic testing was an important variable. As the cost of proband genetic testing decreased, the ICER decreased and was cost saving when the cost fell below $A248 (?161 or ?185). In addition, the mutation identification rate was also important in reducing the overall ICER, although even at the upper limits, the ICER still fell well within accepted willingness to pay bounds.ConclusionsThe addition of genetic testing to the management of HCM families is cost-effective in comparison with the conventional approach of regular clinical screening. This has important implications for the evaluation of families with HCM, and suggests that all should have access to specialised cardiac genetic clinics that can offer genetic testing.",2012-01-08362,22128210,Heart,Jodie Ingles,2012,/,,No,22128210,"Jodie Ingles; Julie McGaughran; Paul A Scuffham; John Atherton; Christopher Semsarian; A cost-effectiveness model of genetic testing for the evaluation of families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Heart, ; ():1468-201X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) screening and management with proband genetic testing vs. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) screening and management with no proband genetic testing,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,785,Australia,2009,750.65
9249,The cost effectiveness of Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques for the diagnosis of tuberculosis,"There is wide variation in the techniques deployed to diagnose tuberculosis in the UK, with little agreement on which tools or strategies are cost effective. This analysis therefore comprehensively evaluated the cost effectiveness of currently available diagnostic strategies for routine diagnosis of TB in the NHS.The analysis compared strategies consisting of Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques, culture and microscopy. A decision tree was used to estimate costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) from a UK health service perspective. The sensitivity and specificity of each test determined the true and false positive and negative results in patients suspected of having active tuberculosis. These results led to either early, correct diagnosis or delayed diagnosis and the associated costs and QALYs. The presence of active tuberculosis combined with the side effects of treatment was associated with reduction in quality of life. Costs included were test costs, drug costs and the management of tuberculosis. Drug costs were based on generic UK list prices. Uncertainty in the model was explored through probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses.The cost effective strategy at threshold of ?20,000 per QALY was a strategy using only sputum microscopy and culture routinely, meaning Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques are not cost effective at baseline. When the prevalence of tuberculosis was increased, however, nucleic acid amplification became cost effective at the same threshold. Aside from the prevalence, the results were shown to be robust.

9251,Economic evaluation of genomic test-directed chemotherapy for early-stage lymph node-positive breast cancer,"Multi-parameter genomic tests identify patients with early-stage breast cancer who are likely to derive little benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. These tests can potentially spare patients the morbidity from unnecessary chemotherapy and reduce costs. However, the costs of the test must be balanced against the health benefits and cost savings produced. This economic evaluation compared genomic test-directed chemotherapy using the Oncotype DX 21-gene assay with chemotherapy for all eligible patients with lymph node-positive, estrogen receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer.We performed a cost-utility analysis using a state transition model to calculate expected costs and benefits over the lifetime of a cohort of women with estrogen receptor-positive lymph node-positive breast cancer from a UK perspective. Recurrence rates for Oncotype DX-selected risk groups were derived from parametric survival models fitted to data from the Southwest Oncology Group 8814 trial. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed as the cost (in 2011 GBP) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Confidence in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was expressed as a probability of cost-effectiveness and was calculated using Monte Carlo simulation. Model parameters were varied deterministically and probabilistically in sensitivity analysis. Value of information analysis was used to rank priorities for further research.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for Oncotype DX-directed chemotherapy using a recurrence score cutoff of 18 was ?5529 (US $8852) per QALY. The probability that test-directed chemotherapy is cost-effective was 0.61 at a willingness-to-pay threshold of ?30?000 per QALY. Results were sensitive to the recurrence rate, long-term anthracycline-related cardiac toxicity, quality of life, test cost, and the time horizon. The highest priority for further research identified by value of information analysis is the recurrence rate in test-selected subgroups.There is substantial uncertainty regarding the cost-effectiveness of Oncotype DX-directed chemotherapy. It is particularly important that future research studies to inform cost-effectiveness-based decisions collect long-term outcome data.",2012-01-08374,22138097,J Natl Cancer Inst,Peter S Hall,2012,104 /,56-66,No,22138097,"Peter S Hall; Christopher McCabe; Robert C Stein; David Cameron; Economic evaluation of genomic test-directed chemotherapy for early-stage lymph node-positive breast cancer, J Natl Cancer Inst, ; 104 ():0027-8874; 56-66",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genomic test-directed chemotherapy using Oncotype DX-21 gene assay with chemotherapy vs. Standard of care (chemotherapy for all patients),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,5529,United Kingdom,2011,10205.89

9262,Incremental benefits and cost of coordinated anxiety learning and management for anxiety treatment in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Improving the quality of mental health care requires integrating successful research interventions into 'real-world' practice settings. Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) is a treatment-delivery model for anxiety disorders encountered in primary care. CALM offers cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medication, or both; non-expert care managers assisting primary care clinicians with adherence promotion and medication optimization; computer-assisted CBT delivery; and outcome monitoring. This study describes incremental benefits, costs and net benefits of CALM versus usual care (UC).MethodThe CALM randomized, controlled effectiveness trial was conducted in 17 primary care clinics in four US cities from 2006 to 2009. Of 1062 eligible patients, 1004 English- or Spanish-speaking patients aged 18-75 years with panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with or without major depression were randomized. Anxiety-free days (AFDs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and expenditures for out-patient visits, emergency room (ER) visits, in-patient stays and psychiatric medications were estimated based on blinded telephone assessments at baseline, 6, 12 and 18 months. RESULTS: Over 18 months, CALM participants, on average, experienced 57.1 more AFDs [95% confidence interval (CI) 31-83] and $245 additional medical expenses (95% CI $-733 to $1223). The mean incremental net benefit (INB) of CALM versus UC was positive when an AFD was valued ?$4. For QALYs based on the Short-Form Health Survey-12 (SF-12) and the EuroQol EQ-5D, the mean INB was positive at ?$5000.

We projected lifetime clinical and economic outcomes based on the results from the DPP+DPPOS, from a 3rd-party payer perspective in Australia. METHODS: A semi-Markov, 2nd-order Monte Carlo model was developed with four health states: ""normal glucose regulation"" (NGR); IGT; T2D and 'dead'. Outcomes were discounted at 5% annually. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: Cumulative incidence (standard deviation) of T2D was 89.7% (0.2), 83.8% (0.2) and 73.4% (0.3%) for control, metformin and ILC respectively. Lifetime incremental direct costs were $1217 (4411) per subject for metformin versus control, with cost savings of $289 (4296) for ILC versus control. ILC therefore dominated control, with improvements in clinical outcomes and overall cost savings. Incremental costs per QALY-gained for metformin versus control were $10,142. Probability of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 was 78% and 100% for metformin or ILC respectively. Results were most sensitive to probabilities of developing T2D and costs of implementing the interventions.

Strategy for its early detection is still controversial. This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of population strategy, i.e. mass screening, and Japan's health checkup reform. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out to compare test modalities in the context of reforming Japan's mandatory annual health checkup for adults. A decision tree and Markov model with societal perspective were constructed to compare dipstick test to check proteinuria only, serum creatinine (Cr) assay only, or both. RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of mass screening compared with do-nothing were calculated as ?1,139,399/QALY (US?$12,660/QALY) for dipstick test only, ?8,122,492/QALY (US?$90,250/QALY) for serum Cr assay only and ?8,235,431/QALY (US?$91,505/QALY) for both.

Research design and methods: The treatment sequences were compared among 3000 hypothetical Finnish msRA patients using a probabilistic microsimulation model in a lifetime scenario. Adalimumab?+?methotrexate, etanercept?+?methotrexate, or tocilizumab?+?methotrexate were used as first biologics followed by rituximab?+?methotrexate and infliximab?+?methotrexate. Best supportive care (BSC), including tDMARDs, was assumed to be used after the exhaustion of the biologics. Methotrexate alone was added as a further comparator. Efficacy was based on ACR responses that were obtained from a mixed treatment comparison. The resources were valued with Finnish unit costs (year 2010) from the healthcare payer perspective. Additional analyses were carried out, including productivity losses. The Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) values were mapped to the EQ-5D values using the tocilizumab trials; 3% annual discounting for costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and extensive sensitivity analyses were completed. Main outcome measures: Incremental cost per QALY gained and multinomial expected value of perfect information (mEVPI). Results: bDMARDs significantly increase the QALYs gained when compared to methotrexate alone. Tocilizumab?+?methotrexate was more cost-effective than adalimumab?+?methotrexate or etanercept?+?methotrexate in comparison with methotrexate alone, and adalimumab?+?methotrexate was dominated by etanercept?+?methotraxate.

9286,Cost-utility of lumbar decompression with or without fusion for patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis,"The most common surgical treatment of symptomatic degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis (DLS) is decompression and instrumented fusion. However, contemporary, midline-sparing, microdecompressive techniques have shown good results for selected patients with stable Grade 1 DLS. Growing concerns over the rising cost and rates of spinal fusion warrant both clinical and economic comparative effectiveness research in this common spinal diagnosis.To determine the relative cost-utility of decompression with and without concomitant instrumented fusion for selected patients with DLS.Comparative cost-effectiveness study.Probabilities and utilities were estimated from an observational cohort study and the current literature. Costing information was obtained from our institution (microcase costing data/patient) and the literature. Probabilities considered were perioperative and general mortality, probability of clinical improvement and clinical worsening, and reoperation.The primary outcome was the incremental cost/utility ratio (ICUR) expressed as the differential cost per relative gain in quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).A Markov model with 10-year follow-up was developed. The analyses were carried out from the hospital's perspective. Sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the model.The cost-utility of decompression with fusion and decompression alone at 10 years postintervention was $3,281/QALY and $1,040/QALY, respectively. Compared with decompression alone, decompression plus instrumented fusion was associated with an improvement in quality of life at a cost of $185,878 per QALY in the base-case analysis. The ICUR was invariant to changes in clinical effectiveness of decompression alone, percentage of inpatient decompressions, and varying cost or QALY discounting rates. The ICUR was sensitive to change in QALY and cost structure changes.For a select subgroup of patients with DLS (leg-dominant pain with a stable Grade 1 spondylolisthesis), decompression without fusion is significantly more cost effective than instrumented fusion and provides an opportunity for increased service delivery and/or cost savings for this growing population.",2012-01-08422,22169001,Spine J,Salin Kim,2012,12 /,44-54,No,22169001,"Salin Kim; Soroush Mortaz Hedjri; Peter C Coyte; Y Raja Rampersaud; Cost-utility of lumbar decompression with or without fusion for patients with symptomatic degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis, Spine J, ; 12 ():1529-9430; 44-54",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Decompression with instrumental fusion (DF) vs. Midline-sparing decompression,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,185878,Canada,2010,214308.8

The main driver of cost was the requirement for electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring of users of QTc-prolonging drugs.

9288,The cost and cost-effectiveness of opportunistic screening for Chlamydia trachomatis in Ireland,"ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to estimate the cost and cost-effectiveness of opportunistic screening for Chlamydia trachomatis in Ireland.MethodsProspective cost analysis of an opportunistic screening programme delivered jointly in three types of healthcare facility in Ireland. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using an existing dynamic modelling framework to compare screening to a control of no organised screening. A healthcare provider perspective was adopted with respect to costs and included the costs of screening and the costs of complications arising from untreated infection. Two outcome measures were examined: major outcomes averted, comprising cases of pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility in women, neonatal conjunctivitis and pneumonia, and epididymitis in men; and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained. Uncertainty was explored using sensitivity analyses and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.ResultsThe average cost per component of screening was estimated at ?26 per offer, ?66 per negative case, ?152 per positive case and ?74 per partner notified and treated. The modelled screening scenario was projected to be more effective and more costly than the control strategy. The incremental cost per major outcomes averted was ?6093, and the incremental cost per QALY gained was ?94?717. For cost-effectiveness threshold values of ?45?000 per QALY gained and lower, the probability of the screening being cost effective was estimated at <1%.ConclusionsAn opportunistic chlamydia screening programme, as modelled in this study, would be expensive to implement nationally and is unlikely to be judged cost effective by policy makers in Ireland.",2012-01-08463,22213681,Sex Transm Infect,Paddy Gillespie,2012,/,,No,22213681,"Paddy Gillespie; Ciaran O'Neill; Elisabeth Adams; Katherine Turner; Diarmuid O'Donovan; Ruairi Brugha; Deirdre Vaughan; Emer O'Connell; Martin Cormican; Myles Balfe; Claire Coleman; Margaret Fitzgerald; Catherine Fleming; The cost and cost-effectiveness of opportunistic screening for Chlamydia trachomatis in Ireland, Sex Transm Infect, ; ():1368-4973",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening program for Chlamydia trachomatis vs. None,Not Stated,29 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,94717,Euro,2008,167661.58
9289,Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Term Outpatient Buprenorphine-Naloxone Treatment for Opioid Dependence in Primary Care,"BACKGROUND: Primary care physicians with appropriate training may prescribe buprenorphine-naloxone (bup/nx) to treat opioid dependence in US office-based settings, where many patients prefer to be treated. Bup/nx is off patent but not available as a generic. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of long-term office-based bup/nx treatment for clinically stable opioid-dependent patients compared to no treatment. DESIGN, SUBJECTS, AND INTERVENTION: A decision analytic model simulated a hypothetical cohort of clinically stable opioid-dependent individuals who have already completed 6 months of office-based bup/nx treatment. Data were from a published cohort study that collected treatment retention, opioid use, and costs for this population, and published quality-of-life weights. Uncertainties in estimated monthly costs and quality-of-life weights were evaluated in probabilistic sensitivity analyses, and the economic value of additional research to reduce these uncertainties was also evaluated. MAIN MEASURES: Bup/nx, provider, and patient costs in 2010 US dollars, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness (CE) ratios ($/QALY); costs and QALYs are discounted at 3% annually. KEY RESULTS: In the base case, office-based bup/nx for clinically stable patients has a CE ratio of $35,100/QALY compared to no treatment after 24?months, with 64% probability of being < $100,000/QALY in probabilistic sensitivity analysis. With a 50% bup/nx price reduction the CE ratio is $23,000/QALY with 69% probability of being < $100,000/QALY. Alternative quality-of-life weights result in CE ratios of $138,000/QALY and $90,600/QALY. The value of research to reduce quality-of-life uncertainties for 24-month results is $6,400 per person eligible for treatment at the current bup/nx price and $5,100 per person with a 50% bup/nx price reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Office-based bup/nx for clinically stable patients may be a cost-effective alternative to no treatment at a threshold of $100,000/QALY depending on assumptions about quality-of-life weights. Additional research about quality-of-life benefits and broader health system and societal cost savings of bup/nx therapy is needed.",2012-01-08468,22215271,J Gen Intern Med,Bruce R Schackman,2012,27 / 6,,No,22215271,"Bruce R Schackman; Jared A Leff; Daniel Polsky; Brent A Moore; David A Fiellin; Cost-Effectiveness of Long-Term Outpatient Buprenorphine-Naloxone Treatment for Opioid Dependence in Primary Care, J Gen Intern Med, ; 27(6):1525-1497",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Buprenorphine-naloxone treatment for opioid dependence vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,24 Months,3.00,3.00,35100,United States,2010,41660.24

Methods: A Markov model was developed to simulate the progression of a cohort of patients with RRMS, during a period of 10 years. Seven health states, defined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), were considered in the model. Patients with an EDSS score less than 6.0 were assumed to be treated with one of the DMD. In addition, all patients were assumed to receive symptomatic treatment. The monthly transition probabilities of the model were obtained from the literature. The analysis was performed from the societal perspective, in which both direct and indirect (losses in productivity) healthcare costs (?, 2010) were included. A discount rate of 3% was applied to both costs and efficacy results. Results: GA was the less costly strategy (?322,510), followed by IM IFN?-1a (?329,595), SC IFN?-1b (? 333,925), and SC IFN?-1a (?348,208). IM IFN?-1a has shown the best efficacy results, with 4.176 quality-adjusted life years (QALY), followed by SC IFN?-1a (4.158 QALY), SC IFN?-1b (4.157 QALY), and GA (4.117 QALY). Incremental costs per QALY gained with IM IFN?-1a were ?-1,005,194/QALY, ?-223,397/QALY, and ?117,914/QALY in comparison to SC IFN?-1a, SC IFN?-1b, and GA, respectively. Conclusions: First-line treatment with GA is the less costly strategy for the treatment of patients with RRMS. Treatment with IM IFN?-1a is a dominant strategy (lower cost and higher QALY) compared with SC IFN?-1a and SC IFN?-1b. However, IM IFN?-1a is not a cost-effective strategy vs GA, because incremental cost per QALY gained with IM IFN?-1a exceeds the ?30,000 per QALY threshold commonly used in Spain. Limitations: The highly-restrictive inclusion criteria of clinical trials limits generalization of the results on efficacy to all patients with multiple sclerosis.

Incremental costs per QALY gained with IM IFN?-1a were ?-1,005,194/QALY, ?-223,397/QALY, and ?117,914/QALY in comparison to SC IFN?-1a, SC IFN?-1b, and GA, respectively. Conclusions: First-line treatment with GA is the less costly strategy for the treatment of patients with RRMS. Treatment with IM IFN?-1a is a dominant strategy (lower cost and higher QALY) compared with SC IFN?-1a and SC IFN?-1b. However, IM IFN?-1a is not a cost-effective strategy vs GA, because incremental cost per QALY gained with IM IFN?-1a exceeds the ?30,000 per QALY threshold commonly used in Spain.

9296,Cost-effectiveness analysis on the surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma in liver cirrhosis patients using contrast-enhanced ultrasonography,"Aim: Sonazoid is a new contrast agent for ultrasonography (US). Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) using Sonazoid enables Kupffer imaging, which improves the sensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) detection. However, there are no studies on the cost-effectiveness of HCC surveillance using Sonazoid. Methods: We constructed a Markov model simulating the natural history of HCV-related liver cirrhosis (LC) patients, and compared three strategies (no surveillance, US surveillance and CEUS surveillance). The transition probability and cost data were obtained from published data. The simulation and analysis were performed using TreeAge pro 2009 software. Results: When compared to the no surveillance group, the US and CEUS surveillance groups increased the life expectancy by 1.67 and 1.99 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), respectively, and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) were 17 296 $US/QALY and 18 384 $US/QALY, respectively. These results were both less than the commonly-accepted threshold of $US 50 000/QALY. Even if the CEUS surveillance group was compared with the US surveillance group, the ICER was $US 24 250 and thus cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis showed that the annual incidence of HCC and CEUS sensitivity were two critical parameters. However, when the annual incidence of HCC is more than 2% and/or the CEUS sensitivity is more than 80%, the ICER was also cost-effective. Conclusions: Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography surveillance for HCC is a cost-effective strategy for LC patients and gains their longest additional life years, with similar degree of ICER in the US surveillance group.

9299,Cost-Effectiveness of Clopidogrel Plus Aspirin for Stroke Prevention in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation in Whom Warfarin Is Unsuitable,"Guidelines for atrial fibrillation (AF) recommend clopidogrel plus aspirin as an alternative stroke prevention strategy in patients in whom warfarin is unsuitable. A Markov model was conducted from a Medicare prospective using data from the Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events-A (ACTIVE-A) trial and other published studies. Base-case analysis evaluated patients 65 years old with AF, a CHADS(2) (congestive heart failure, 1 point; hypertension defined as blood pressure consistently >140/90 mm Hg or antihypertension medication, 1 point; age =75 years, 1 point; diabetes mellitus, 1 point; previous stroke or transient ishemic attack, 2 points) score of 2, and a lower risk for major bleeding. Patients received clopidogrel 75 mg/day plus aspirin or aspirin alone. Patients were followed for up to 35 years. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs (in 2011 American dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Quality-adjusted life expectancy and costs were 9.37 QALYs and $88,751 with clopidogrel plus aspirin and 9.01 QALYs and $79,057 with aspirin alone. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for clopidogrel plus aspirin was $26,928/QALY. With 1-way sensitivity analysis using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, clopidogrel plus aspirin was no longer cost effective when the CHADS(2) score was =1, major bleeding risk with aspirin was =2.50%/patient-year, the relative risk decrease for ischemic stroke with clopidogrel plus aspirin versus aspirin alone was <25%, and the utility of being healthy with AF on combination therapy decreased to 0.95. Monte Carlo simulation demonstrated that clopidogrel plus aspirin was cost effective in 55% and 73% of 10,000 iterations assuming willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000/QALY. In conclusion, clopidogrel plus aspirin appears cost-effective compared to aspirin alone for stroke prevention in patients with AF with a CHADS(2) of =2 and a lower risk of bleeding.",2012-01-08475,22221944,Am J Cardiol,Craig I Coleman,2012,/,,No,22221944,"Craig I Coleman; Andrew D Straznitskas; Diana M Sobieraj; Jeffrey Kluger; Moise W Anglade; Cost-Effectiveness of Clopidogrel Plus Aspirin for Stroke Prevention in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation in Whom Warfarin Is Unsuitable, Am J Cardiol, ; ():0002-9149",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Clopidogrel plus aspirin vs. Aspirin alone,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,26928,United States,2011,30982.9
9300,A cost-effectiveness analysis of an in-hospital clinical pharmacist service,"Objective A randomised controlled study performed from 2007 to 2008 showed beneficial effects of a composite clinical pharmacist service as regards a simple health status instrument. The present study aimed to evaluate if the intervention was cost-effective when evaluated in a decision-theoretic model. Design A piggyback cost-effectiveness analysis from the healthcare perspective. Setting Two internal medicine wards at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, G?teborg, Sweden. Participants Of 345 patients (61% women; median age: 82 years; 181 control and 164 intervention patients), 240 patients (62% women, 82 years; 124 control and 116 intervention patients) had EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) utility scores at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Outcome measures Costs during a 6-month follow-up period in all patients and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in patients with EQ-5D utility scores. Inpatient and outpatient care was extracted from the VEGA database. Drug costs were extracted from the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. A probabilistic analysis was performed to characterise uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness model. Results No significant difference in costs between the randomisation groups was found; the mean total costs per individual?SD, intervention costs included, were ?10?748?13?799 (intervention patients) and ?10?344?14?728 (control patients) (p=0.79). For patients in the cost-effectiveness analysis, the corresponding costs were ?10?912?13?999 and ?9290?12?885. Intervention patients gained an additional 0.0051 QALYs (unadjusted) and 0.0035 QALYs (adjusted for baseline EQ-5D utility score). These figures result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ?316?243 per unadjusted QALY and ?463?371 per adjusted QALY. The probabilistic uncertainty analysis revealed that, at a willingness-to-pay of ?50?000/QALY, the probability that the intervention was cost-effective was approximately 0.2. Conclusions The present study reveals that an intervention designed like this one is probably not cost-effective. The study thus illustrates that the complexity of healthcare requires thorough health economics evaluations rather than simplistic interpretation of data.",2012-01-08479,22223840,BMJ Open,Susanna M Wallerstedt,2012,2 /,e000329,No,22223840,"Susanna M Wallerstedt; Lina Bladh; Joakim Ramsberg; A cost-effectiveness analysis of an in-hospital clinical pharmacist service, BMJ Open , ; 2 ():2044-6055; e000329",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Composite clinical pharmacist service to improve drug treatment vs. None,Not Stated,82 Years,82 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,46857.14,Euro,2010,73602.7
