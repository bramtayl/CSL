4601,A second-order simulation model of the cost-effectiveness of managing dyspepsia in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The ""gold-standard'' evidence of effectiveness for a clinical practice guideline is the randomized controlled trial (RCT), although RCTs have a limited ability to explore potential management strategies for a chronic disease where these interact over time. Modeling can be used to fill this gap, and models have become increasingly complex, with both dynamic sampling and representation of second-order uncertainty to provide more precise estimates. However, both simulation modeling and probabilistic sensitivity analysis are rarely used together. The objective of this study was to explore uncertainty in controversial areas of the 2005 American Gastroenterology Association position statement on the management of dyspepsia. METHODS: Individual sampling model, incorporating a second-order probabilistic sensitivity analysis. POPULATION: US adult patients presenting in primary care with dyspepsia. Interventions compared: empirical acid suppression, test and treat for Helicobacter pylori, initial endoscopy, acid suppression then endoscopy, test and treat then proton pump inhibitor (PPI) then endoscopy. OUTCOMES: Cost-effectiveness, quality-adjusted life years, and costs in US dollars from a societal perspective, measured over a 5-year period. Data sources: mainly Cochrane meta-analyses. RESULTS: Endoscopy was dominated at all ages by other strategies. PPI therapy was the most cost-effective strategy in 30-year-olds with a low prevalence of H. pylori. In 60-year-olds, H. pylori test and treat was the most cost-effective option.

4605,"Cost effectiveness of hormone therapy in women at high risks of fracture in Sweden, the US and the UK--results based on the Women's Health Initiative randomised controlled trial","OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to assess the cost effectiveness of hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women without menopausal symptoms at an increased risk of fracture in Sweden, the UK and the US. METHODS: Using a state-transition model, the cost effectiveness of 50 year old women was assessed based on a societal perspective and the medical evidence found in the Women Health Initiative (WHI) trials. The model had a lifetime horizon divided into cycle lengths of 1 year and comprised the following disease states: hip fracture, vertebral fracture, wrist fracture, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke and venous thromboembolic events. An intervention was modelled by its impact on the disease risks during and after the cessation of treatment. The model required data on clinical effects, risks, mortality rates, quality of life weights and costs valid for Sweden, the UK and the US. The main outcome of the model was cost per QALY gained of HT compared to no treatment. RESULTS: The results indicated that HT compared to no treatment was cost-effective for most sub-groups of hysterectomised women, whereas for women with an intact uterus without a previous fracture, HT was commonly dominated by no treatment. Fracture risks were the single most important determinant of the cost effectiveness results. CONCLUSIONS: HT is cost-effective in women with a hysterectomy irrespective of prior fracture status. In women with an intact uterus, opposed HT was cost-effective in those with a prior vertebral fracture, but cost-ineffective in women without a prior vertebral fracture.

4617,Cost of preventing variceal rebleeding with transjugular intrahepatic portal systemic shunt and distal splenorenal shunt,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: We examined the cost and cost effectiveness of distal splenorenal shunt (DSRS) and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) in the prevention of variceal rebleeding. METHODS: Patients participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing DSRS to TIPS. Quality of life (QOL) was measured using SF-36 preceding randomization and yearly thereafter. Cost utility analysis was performed using TreeAge DATA. Costs for both in- and out-patient events and interventions were obtained for each patient. Costs using coated stents were estimated using different rates of stenosis. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were determined at 1, 3 and 5 years. RESULTS: The average yearly costs of managing patients after TIPS and DSRS over 5 years were similar, $16,363 and $13,492, respectively. Cost of TIPS for surviving patients exceeded the cost of DSRS at years 3 and 5 but not significantly. ICERs per life saved favored TIPS at year 5 ($61,000). If coated rather than bare stents were used the cost effectiveness of TIPS increased slightly. CONCLUSIONS: TIPS is as effective as DSRS in preventing variceal rebleeding and may be more cost effective.

The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of FE(NO) measurement at a reimbursement price of euro34 using NIOX MINO, a portable non-invasive FE(NO) monitor, in asthma diagnosis and management. METHODS: Two decision trees were constructed to capture the different alternatives and consequences in asthma diagnosis and management, comparing FE(NO) measurement against standard diagnostics and treatment guidelines. The impact of asthma management with FE(NO) measurement on resource use and health outcomes was evaluated over a 1-year timeframe. A German payer perspective was chosen. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS: Asthma diagnosis based on FE(NO) measurement results in a cost of euro38 per patient compared with euro26 for standard diagnostics. In mild to severe patients, asthma management with FE(NO) measurement instead of standard guidelines results in cost-savings of euro30 per patient and year. In a more severe population, management with FE(NO) measurement would save costs of euro160 per patient.

4621,Greater first year effectiveness drives favorable cost-effectiveness of brand risedronate versus generic or brand alendronate: modeled Canadian analysis,"The RisedronatE and ALendronate (REAL) study provided a unique opportunity to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses based on effectiveness data from real-world clinical practice. Using a published osteoporosis model, the researchers found risedronate to be cost-effective compared to generic or brand alendronate for the treatment of Canadian postmenopausal osteoporosis in patients aged 65 years or older. INTRODUCTION: The REAL study provides robust data on the real-world performance of risedronate and alendronate. The study used these data to assess the cost-effectiveness of brand risedronate versus generic or brand alendronate for treatment of Canadian postmenopausal osteoporosis patients aged 65 years or older. METHODS: A previously published osteoporosis model was populated with Canadian cost and epidemiological data, and the estimated fracture risk was validated. Effectiveness data were derived from REAL and utility data from published sources. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was estimated from a Canadian public payer perspective, and comprehensive sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The base case analysis found fewer fractures and more QALYs in the risedronate cohort, providing an incremental cost per QALY gained of $3,877 for risedronate compared to generic alendronate. The results were most sensitive to treatment duration and effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: The REAL study provided a unique opportunity to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses based on effectiveness data taken from real-world clinical practice.

4622,An estimate of lifelong costs and QALYs in renal replacement therapy based on patients' life expectancy,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate lifelong costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) of hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) and renal transplantation (Tx) in Greece, based on individual patient life expectancy. METHODS: A nationally representative patient sample on each modality, HD: N=642, PD: N=65 and Tx: N=167, was self-administered the SF-36 Health Survey, from which the preference-based SF-6D utility index was derived. Lifelong QALYs were estimated from literature-based expected remaining life years according to age, gender and modality. Cost analyses were performed from the perspective of the health system. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 5% and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Estimated lifelong QALYs were 4.37 (HD), 3.94 (PD) and 16.11 (Tx) (P<0.001). Annual HD and PD costs per patient were estimated at euro36,247 and euro30,719 respectively. For Tx, average 1st year, 3-year and lifelong (undiscounted) costs were euro31,714, euro43,275 and euro151,274 respectively. Cost per QALY was higher in HD (euro60,353) compared to PD (euro54,504) and 1st year Tx (euro45,523). CONCLUSIONS: HD is used by 75% of the Greek ESRD patients, hence cost-saving efforts must be intensified.

4625,Cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronization therapy in combination with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (CRT-D) for the treatment of chronic heart failure from a German health care systemperspective,"AIM : The aim of the study was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in combination with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (CRT-D) plus Optimal Pharmacological Therapy (OPT) compared to OPT alone in patients with chronic heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision analytic model was used to estimate the ICER from a German Health Care System perspective. Effectiveness data were used as reported in the COMPANION study. Direct medical costs were considered for inpatient and outpatient treatments. Resource utilization was valued by the prices charged in 2005. Costs and effects were discounted by a discount rate of 3% per year. Oneway and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed. The basecase analysis resulted in accumulated discounted QALYs of 0.958 for OPT, respectively 1.261 for CRT-D + OPT. Accumulated discounted costs were 4618 Euro for OPT, and 31 292 Euro for CRT-D + OPT, respectively, thus resulting in incremental costs per QALY gained of 88 143 Euro after two years. Considering a device longevity of seven years, this resulted in incremental costs per QALY of 24 650 Euro.

4628,Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment with epoietin-alpha for patients with anaemia due to renal failure: the case of Sweden,"OBJECTIVE: Anaemia is a common complication of renal failure. It can be treated with erythropoietin (EPO) administration, red blood cell transfusion (RBCT), or a combination of both. EPO has been registered for the treatment of renal anaemia in Sweden since the beginning of the 1990s, and is the primary treatment regimen for anaemia related to renal failure. The objective of this study was to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis from a provider perspective of a treatment strategy comprising EPO and complementary RBCT compared to the traditional treatment of RBCT alone for patients with anaemia associated with renal failure in Sweden. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with EPO (epoietin-alpha) treatment compared to the traditional therapy of RBCT were estimated. The QALY gains were estimated using a modified version of a Markov model, which is used by the UK National Institute of Clinical Excellence in their evaluations of EPO treatment in the UK. Swedish treatment practice (i.e. EPO doses and iron supplementation), patient characteristics and unit costs were used throughout the study. RESULTS: The estimated cost per QALY gained from administration of EPO to renal patients falls within the range acceptable in Sweden for both haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients. CONCLUSIONS: EPO administration to renal patients is much more costly in Sweden than in the UK, primarily due to the higher dosage of EPO and iron supplementation used in Sweden.

4630,Cost-effectiveness of motivational interviewing for smoking cessation and relapse prevention among low-income pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: Low-income women have high rates of smoking during pregnancy, but little is known about the costs, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of motivational interviewing (MI), focused on the medical and psychosocial needs of this population, as an intervention for smoking cessation and relapse prevention. METHODS: A sample of 302 low-income pregnant women was recruited from multiple obstetrical sites in the Boston metropolitan area into a randomized controlled trial of a motivational intervention for smoking cessation and relapse prevention versus usual care (UC). The findings of this clinical trial were used to estimate the costs, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of the intervention from a societal perspective, incorporating published quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and life-year (LY) estimates. Outcomes included smoking cessation and relapse, maternal and infant outcomes, economic costs, LYs and QALYs saved, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of MI for relapse prevention compared to UC was estimated to be $851/LY saved and $628/QALY saved. Including savings in maternal medical costs in sensitivity analyses resulted in cost savings for MI for relapse prevention compared to UC. For smoking cessation, MI cost more but did not provide additional benefit compared to UC. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness of MI versus UC would have been $117,100/LY saved and $86,300/QALY saved if 8% of smokers had quit. In two-way sensitivity analyses, MI was still relatively cost-effective for relapse prevention ($17,300/QALY saved) even if it cost as much as $2000/participant and was less effective. For smoking cessation, however, a higher level of effectiveness (9/110) and higher cost ($400/participant) resulted in higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ($112,000/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Among low-income pregnant women, MI helps prevent relapse at relatively low cost, and may be cost-saving when net medical cost savings are considered. For smoking cessation, MI cost more but provided no additional benefit compared to UC, but might offer benefits at costs comparable to other clinical preventive interventions if 8-10% of smokers are induced to quit.",2008-01-03090,17854434,Value Health,Jennifer Prah Ruger,2008,11 / 2,191-8,Yes,17854434,"Jennifer Prah Ruger; Milton C Weinstein; S Katherine Hammond; Margaret H Kearney; Karen M Emmons; Milton C Weinstein; S Katherine Hammond; Margaret H Kearney; Karen M Emmons; Cost-effectiveness of motivational interviewing for smoking cessation and relapse prevention among low-income pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial, Value Health, 2008 Mar-Apr; 11(2):1098-3015; 191-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Motivational interviewing vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,-7600,United States,1997,-12255.22

A scientific base for policy targets for the Dutch national plan for action","OBJECTIVES: To gain insight in realistic policy targets for overweight at a population level and the accompanying costs. Therefore, the effect on overweight prevalence was estimated of large scale implementation of a community intervention (applied to 90% of general population) and an intensive lifestyle program (applied to 10% of overweight adults), and costs and cost-effectiveness were assessed. METHODS: Costs and effects were based on two Dutch projects and verified by similar international projects. A markov-type simulation model estimated long-term health benefits, health care costs and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Combined implementation of the interventions--at the above mentioned scale--reduces prevalence rates of overweight by approximately 3 percentage points and of physical inactivity by 2 percentage points after 5 years, at a cost of 7 euros per adult capita per year. The cost-effectiveness ratio of combined implementation amounts to euro 6000 per life-year gained and euro 5700 per QALY gained (including costs of unrelated diseases in life years gained). Sensitivity analyses showed that these ratios are quite robust.

4635,Cost-effectiveness of Add-on Therapy with Pregabalin in Patients with Refractory Partial Epilepsy,"Purpose: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of pregabalin as add-on therapy in patients with refractory partial epilepsy. Methods: We developed a model to estimate clinical and economic outcomes over 1 year in a hypothetical cohort of patients with refractory partial epilepsy assumed alternatively to receive add-on therapy with pregabalin (300 mg/day) or no add-on therapy. For each patient in the model, we estimated the occurrence of seizure and side effects, using techniques of stochastic simulation. We assigned health-state utilities to each day of follow-up based on whether or not seizure or side effects were predicted to occur. Patients could discontinue therapy due to lack of efficacy or side effects. Outcomes included expected numbers of days without seizure (""seizure-free [SF] days""), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs of therapy. Cost-effectiveness was assessed alternatively in terms of incremental cost per SF day gained and incremental cost per QALY gained. Results: Add-on therapy with pregabalin was estimated to result in an average gain of 23.8 SF days over one year; the estimated additional cost of therapy was $678. Incremental cost (mean, 95% CI) per SF day gained was $28.45 ($27.25, $29.44); corresponding estimates of incremental cost per QALY gained were $52,893 ($49,249, $56,983).

4636,An economic analysis of aspirin desensitization in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease,"BACKGROUND: Aspirin desensitization is an effective therapy for moderate-to-severe aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Desensitization also allows the use of aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the cost-effectiveness of aspirin desensitization with subsequent aspirin therapy in patients with AERD. METHODS: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was used, together with average reimbursements from a large Midwestern health care plan, to model the costs of aspirin desensitization for therapeutic and prophylactic use in patients with AERD. Event probabilities were based on the published literature. RESULTS: Ambulatory desensitization for AERD cost $6768 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved ($18.54 per additional symptom-free day). Aspirin desensitization for AERD remained cost-effective (<$50,000 per QALY saved) across a wide range of assumptions. When secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis was considered, ambulatory aspirin desensitization was less expensive than an alternative antiplatelet agent, clopidogrel. Clopidogrel cost $106,453 per incremental QALY saved when compared with desensitization.

4639,An economic analysis of aspirin desensitization in aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease,"BACKGROUND: Aspirin desensitization is an effective therapy for moderate-to-severe aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD). Desensitization also allows the use of aspirin for secondary cardiovascular prevention. OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the cost-effectiveness of aspirin desensitization with subsequent aspirin therapy in patients with AERD. METHODS: The Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project was used, together with average reimbursements from a large Midwestern health care plan, to model the costs of aspirin desensitization for therapeutic and prophylactic use in patients with AERD. Event probabilities were based on the published literature. RESULTS: Ambulatory desensitization for AERD cost $6768 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved ($18.54 per additional symptom-free day). Aspirin desensitization for AERD remained cost-effective (<$50,000 per QALY saved) across a wide range of assumptions. When secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis was considered, ambulatory aspirin desensitization was less expensive than an alternative antiplatelet agent, clopidogrel. Clopidogrel cost $106,453 per incremental QALY saved when compared with desensitization.

4640,Cost-effectiveness of the surveillance program of hepatocellular carcinoma depends on the medical circumstances,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: The clinical features of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the medical environment are diverse in different geographic areas. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the surveillance of HCC in different medical circumstances. METHODS: The Markov model focused on variables that differ from country to country and may change in the future, especially in regards to the proportion of small HCC detected incidentally. The target population was 45-year-old patients with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis, and the intervention was surveillance with ultrasonography every 6 months. RESULTS: The additional cost of the surveillance was $US15 100, the gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was 0.50 years, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $US29 900/QALY in a base-case analysis (annual incidence of HCC = 4%). If 40% of small HCC were detected incidentally without surveillance, the gain in QALY decreased to 0.15 and the ICER increased to $US47 900/QALY. The increase in the annual incidence of HCC to 8% resulted in the increase of QALYs to 0.81, and the decrease of the ICER to $US25 400/QALY. The adoption of liver transplantation increased the gain in QALYs and the ICER to 0.84 and $US59 900/QALY, respectively.

4642,Cost-effectiveness analyses of health promotion programs: a case study of smoking prevention and cessation among Dutch students,"Little research has been done to connect health promotion programs to outcomes in terms of life expectancy, health care costs and cost-effectiveness. For a policy maker, economic evaluation may be an important tool to support decisions on how to allocate the health care budget. The aim of this paper was to determine the cost-effectiveness of a Dutch school-based smoking education program. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the school program was estimated at euro19 900 per quality adjusted life year gained. For a complete analysis, not only intervention costs but also savings for smoking-related diseases and differences in total health care costs should be taken into account. As several assumptions had to be made in order to estimate cost-effectiveness, the study outcomes should be interpreted with caution. Main problem in estimating the cost-effectiveness was the lack of proper effectiveness data on daily smokers among adolescents. Absence of specific effectiveness data often is an obstacle in the economic evaluation of public health interventions. While some problems may be the result of insufficient sample size or follow-up, another possible explanation might be the different basic principles of analysis of health promoters and economists.",2008-01-03166,17675649,Health Educ Res,S M C Vijgen,2008,23 / 2,310-8,No,17675649,"S M C Vijgen; P H M van Baal; R T Hoogenveen; G A de Wit; T L Feenstra; P H M van Baal; R T Hoogenveen; G A de Wit; T L Feenstra; Cost-effectiveness analyses of health promotion programs: a case study of smoking prevention and cessation among Dutch students, Health Educ Res, 2008-Apr; 23(2):0268-1153; 310-8",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dutch school-based smooking education program to prevent or stop smoking in adolescents vs. No program,Not Stated,14 Years,14 Years,"Female, Male",Full,100 Years,4.00,4.00,19900,Euro,2004,33912.53
4643,Cost-effectiveness of letrozole versus tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with hormone-receptor positive early breast cancer from a Canadian perspective,"BACKGROUND: In the primary core analysis of BIG 1-98, a randomized, double-blind trial comparing 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with letrozole versus tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early breast cancer, letrozole significantly improved disease-free survival by 19% and reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence by 28% and distant recurrence by 27%. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with letrozole versus tamoxifen from a Canadian healthcare system perspective. Probabilities of recurrence and side effects for tamoxifen were based on published results of BIG 1-98 and other published population-based studies. Corresponding probabilities for letrozole were calculated by multiplying probabilities for tamoxifen by estimated relative risks for letrozole versus tamoxifen from BIG 1-98. Other probabilities, costs of breast-cancer care and treatment of side effects, and health-state utilities were obtained from published studies. Costs and QALYs were estimated over the lifetime of a cohort of postmenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer, aged 60 years at initiation of therapy, and discounted at 5% annually. RESULTS: Compared with tamoxifen, letrozole yields an additional 0.368 life-years (12.453 vs. 12.086) and 0.343 QALYs (11.582 vs. 11.239). These benefits are obtained at an additional cost of $Can 8,110 ($Can 30,819 vs. $Can 22,709). Cost per QALY gained for letrozole versus tamoxifen is $Can 23,662 (95% CI $Can 15,667-$Can 52,014).

METHODS: We use a dynamic computer simulation model to estimate health and economic impacts of raising taxes on cigarettes (up to 100% price increase) for the entire population of the USA over 20 years. We also perform sensitivity analysis on price elasticity. RESULTS: A 40% tax-induced cigarette price increase would reduce smoking prevalence from 21% in 2004 to 15.2% in 2025 with large gains in cumulative life years (7 million) and quality adjusted life years (13 million) over 20 years. Total tax revenue will increase by $365 billion in that span, and total smoking-related medical costs would drop by $317 billion, resulting in total savings of $682 billion.

4651,Echocardiographic risk stratification for early surgery with endocarditis: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Despite widespread acceptance of echocardiography for diagnosis of infective endocarditis, few investigators have evaluated its utility as a risk-stratification tool to aid therapeutic decision-making. METHODS: A decision tree and Markov analysis model were constructed using published and institutional data to estimate the cost-effectiveness of an echocardiographic risk-stratification strategy for infective endocarditis. The models compared surgery for high-risk patients based on clinical factors (""standard care"") and surgery for high-risk patients based on echocardiographic findings (""echocardiography-guided""). RESULTS: The cost per patient for standard care and echocardiography-guided strategies was $47,766 and $53,669, respectively. The expected quality-adjusted life years (QALY) for standard care and echocardiography-guided strategies were 5.86 years and 6.10 years, respectively. Compared with standard care, the echocardiography-guided strategy cost an additional $23,867 per QALY saved. In one-way sensitivity analyses, the incremental cost of this strategy remained <$50,000/QALY across a broad range of scenarios. Baseline stroke risk had the greatest effect on cost-effectiveness. For populations with stroke risk less than 3.65%, the echocardiography-guided strategy was not cost-attractive (ICER >$50,000/QALY). At stroke risk between 3.65% and 14%, the ICER for the echocardiography-guided strategy was attractive (<$50,000 /QALY).

4652,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of height-screening programmes during the primary school years: a systematic review,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of height screening (of children aged 4 to 11) to identify height-related conditions. DESIGN: Systematic review and economic modelling. SETTING AND INTERVENTION: We included published and unpublished screening studies of any design, except case reports, conducted in any setting that measured children's height as part of a population-level assessment. Studies were identified by electronic database searches, contact with experts and from bibliographies of retrieved studies. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged between 4 and 11 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Diagnostic yield of height-related conditions and change in quality of life, as measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), for early versus late treatment of underlying conditions. RESULTS: Twelve studies described a height-screening programme and provided data on the diagnostic yield of newly diagnosed height-related conditions. Where reported, yield for growth-hormone deficiency (per 1000 children screened) ranged from 0.05 (1 in 20,000) to 0.62 (approximately 1 in 1500) and for Turner syndrome (per 1000 children screened) was between 0.02 (1 in 50,000) and 0.07 (approximately 1 in 14,000). As a secondary gain, children with other potentially treatable conditions were identified; diagnostic yields ranged from 0.22 to 1.84 per 1000 children screened. Three studies did not detect any new cases, but all of these studies had methodological limitations. Economic modelling suggested that height screening is associated with health improvements and is cost effective for a willingness to pay threshold of pound 30,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates the utility and acceptable cost-effectiveness of height screening arising from increased detection of height-related disorders and secondary pick-up of other undiagnosed conditions. Further research is needed to obtain more reliable data on quality of life gains and costs associated with early interventions for height-related conditions.

4653,Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nebivolol Compared with Standard Care in Elderly Patients with Heart Failure: An Individual Patient-Based Simulation Model,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The SENIORS trial demonstrated that nebivolol is effective in the treatment of heart failure in elderly patients (e.g. >/=70 years). This analysis evaluates the cost effectiveness of nebivolol compared with standard treatment. METHODS: An individual patient-simulation model based on a Markov modelling framework was developed to compare costs and outcomes for nebivolol and standard care in patients with heart failure starting treatment at the age of 70 years. Health states were defined by New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and death. At a given NYHA class and a given cycle, patients could die, be hospitalized for cardiovascular disease or remain stable. Risks for these events were derived from individual patient data from the SENIORS trial. The risk of each event in a given cycle was based on the subject's baseline characteristics and time in the current health state. The economic analysis was conducted from the UK NHS perspective with a lifetime horizon. The costs (euro; year 2006 values) considered were drug costs for nebivolol and other cardiac drugs, costs of GP visits, outpatient specialist visits and cardiovascular-related hospitalizations. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: In the baseline analysis, the total cost per patient was euro6740 and euro9288, and QALYs were 5.194 and 5.843 for patients aged 70 years at the start of treatment for the standard treatment and nebivolol groups, respectively. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis provided an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro3926 (95% CI 3731, 4159) per QALY.

4659,Cost effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for primary prevention in a belgian context,"BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy was traditionally applied in patients who survived a cardiac arrest or who experienced a symptomatic ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Its use in primary prevention (i.e. in patients who have yet to experience a serious arrhythmic event, but who are considered at high risk for sudden cardiac death) has become more common, and policy makers question whether ICD therapy should be reimbursed in these instances. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of primary prevention ICD therapy versus conventional therapy from the perspective of the Belgian health insurance system. METHOD: A lifetime 1-month cycle Markov model was constructed and populated with clinical and effectiveness data from the SCD-HeFT study and real-world Belgian cost data expressed in year 2005 values. Probabilistic modelling and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: ICD therapy results in 1.22 life-years gained (LYG) or 1.03 QALYs gained. The lifetime cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were euro59 989 (95% CI 35 873, 113 518) per LYG and euro71 428 (95% CI 40 225, 134 623) per QALY gained, respectively. A cost-effectiveness ratio <euro50 000 per QALY gained was obtained in 15.5% of 1000 simulations. Increasing the service life of the device from 5 to 7 years would improve the cost effectiveness to euro57 229 (95% CI 32 568, 106 410) per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: ICD therapy may not be judged cost effective for the primary prevention of death in patients with a SCD-HeFT profile in the Belgian context using current technology and patient selection.

4660,The cost-effectiveness of treatment with erythropoietin compared to red blood cell transfusions for patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia: a Markov model,"BACKGROUND: Anaemia is a common complication of chemotherapy. As anaemia can lead to e.g. fatigue, depression, social isolation and chest pain it diminishes physical capacity and quality of life. It is generally accepted that symptomatic anaemia should be corrected. Treatment options include red blood cell transfusion (RBCT), erythropoietin (EPO) administration or a combination of both. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to carry out a cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment with EPO (epoetin alfa), compared to treatment with RBCT for patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia in Sweden from a health care perspective. METHOD: A model was developed for estimating incremental costs and QALY gains associated with EPO treatment compared to treatment with RBCTs, based on a model commissioned by the UK National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and adjusted to reflect Swedish treatment practice. Data regarding patient characteristics, response rates, and RBCT was derived from a Swedish observational study of EPO treatment in cancer patients with chemotherapy related anaemia. Swedish guidelines and unit costs were used throughout the study. A systematic review of EPO for treatment of anaemia associated with cancer was used to estimate QALY gains associated with changes in Hb-concentrations in our model. RESULTS: The model's results validate well to real world data from three major hospitals in Sweden. The cost per QALY gained from administration of EPO was estimated at EUR 24,700 in the base case analysis. Practicing an EPO treatment target Hb-level of 12 g/dl yields a cost per QALY about 40% lower than practicing a Hb-target level of 13 g/dl, which is in agreement with updated recommendations of using a 12 g/dl target. CONCLUSION: The estimated cost per QALY falls well within the range acceptable in Sweden when practicing a Hb-target level of 12 g/dl. The incremental cost of elevating Hb-levels above 13 g/dl is very high in relation to the incremental QALY gain achieved.",2008-01-03571,18770060,Acta Oncol,Sixten Borg,2008,47 / 6,1009-17,No,18770060,"Sixten Borg; Anna H Glenngård; Anders Osterborg; Ulf Persson; The cost-effectiveness of treatment with erythropoietin compared to red blood cell transfusions for patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia: a Markov model, Acta Oncol, 2008; 47(6):0284-186X; 1009-17",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,EPO(epoitin alfa) starting at hemoglobin level 12g/dl vs. Red blood cell transfusion treatment (RBCT) alone with a trigger of 10g/dl,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,24700,Euro,2007,42271.71
4661,An economic evaluation of vasoactive agents used to treat acute bleeding oesophageal varices in Belgium,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Increasingly, cost influences all areas of healthcare, including the management of life threatening events, such as bleeding oesophageal varices (BOV). In light of the need to control costs, an economic evaluation of vasoactive agents used to treat cirrhotic patients with BOV within the emergency setting in Belgium has been assessed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A previously reported economic evaluation of vasoactive agents used to treat BOV was identified and adapted to the Belgium hospital setting. The economic evaluation was based on double-blind randomised controlled trials of vasoactive agents previously reported as Cochrane meta-analyses. Belgian cost data was obtained from local published sources and hospital databases. We assessed average disaggregated and aggregated treatment costs, average and incremental cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and life-years gained (LYG). RESULTS: Total treatment costs at 1 year were: terlipressin Euro 2,734; somatostatine Euro 2,972; octreotide Euro 2,801; and placebo Euro 2,874. The average costs per QALY were: terlipressin Euro 4,672; somatostatine Euro 5,878; octreotide Euro 5,540; and placebo Euro 5,687. In the cost per LYG analysis terlipressin achieved the lowest cost per life-year. Results from the incremental cost per QALY and LYG analysis indicated that terlipressin was the most cost-effective agent. CONCLUSIONS: One year simulations indicate somatostatine is the most expensive treatment option and terlipressin the least costly.

Amongst the vasoactive products, the incremental analysis indicated terlipressin was dominant when compared with octreotide and somatostatine because of improved survival and cost-saving potential that is likely attributed to avoiding additional and more costly interventions.",2008-01-03573,18720934,Acta Gastroenterol Belg,Mark Connolly,2008,71 / 2,230-6,No,18720934,"Mark Connolly; Aomesh Bhatt; Jaro Wechowski; Isabelle Colle; An economic evaluation of vasoactive agents used to treat acute bleeding oesophageal varices in Belgium, Acta Gastroenterol Belg, 2008 Apr-Jun; 71(2):0001-5644; 230-6",QALY,Belgium,Not Stated,Not Stated,Octreotide vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,303000,Euro,2005,499858.9
4663,A cost-utility analysis of pregabalin in the management of peripheral neuropathic pain,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost per QALY (quality-adjusted life years) of pregabalin in the management of peripheral neuropathic pain. METHODS: We compared pregabalin on top of ""usual care"" with ""usual care"" alone. In this study, usual care was defined as a mix of drug therapies, excluding anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), because the latter represented only 9% of current use, and clinical evidence of pregabalin was demonstrated versus usual care without anti-epileptic drugs. A Markov model was developed to simulate the evolution of a patient cohort over 1 year, and applied cycles of 4 weeks. During each cycle, patients remained in 1 out of 4 possible states: severe, moderate or mild pain, and therapy withdrawal. The health care payers perspective was taken into account. Clinical data were obtained from a trial comparing usual care plus placebo to usual care plus pregabalin, at either 150, 300, or 300/600 mg/day (the latter depending on clearance of creatinin). Resulting effects on pain were transformed into transition-probabilities between different pain levels. Cost and SF36 utility data of pain levels were obtained from a 1-month observational study in 88 patients. RESULTS: Usual care resulted in a yearly cost of Euros 6,200 compared to Euros 5,984 for an all dose pregabalin-mix, meaning a cost saving of Euros 216 per patient. Utility increase was 0.01 for the pregabalin-mix (QALY 0.510 usual care; 0.520 pregabalin-mix). Monte Carlo analysis showed cost savings were not significant. However, the utility gain, albeit small, was statistically significant.

4667,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a universal vaccination programme with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) in Sweden,"The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) has proved to be highly effective against invasive pneumococcal disease and has also provided some protection against all-cause pneumonia and acute otitis media. The objective of this study was to evaluate the projected health benefits, costs and cost-effectiveness of vaccination with the 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine compared with no vaccination, in all infants in Sweden, taking herd immunity into account. A Markov model was used and a hypothetical birth cohort was simulated for a lifelong perspective. The results show that vaccination of 1 cohort could potentially prevent 9 cases of pneumococcal meningitis, 22 cases of pneumococcal septicaemia, 509 cases of hospitalized pneumonia, 7812 cases of acute otitis media, and 2.7 fatalities, among children 0-4 y of age and 6 episodes of pneumococcal meningitis and 167 cases of pneumococcal septicaemia among adults. The incremental cost per QALY and LY gained was estimated to euro29,200 and euro51,400, respectively. When herd immunity was accounted for, the cost per QALY and LY gained was estimated to euro5500 and euro6600, respectively.

Therefore, this approach seems suitable as a new strategy to face HCV and prevent end stage liver diseases and premature deaths due to progressed chronic HCV-infections. The main limitation of this approach is that the majority of acute infections show an asymptomatic course and do thus not present to the health-care settings. Screening for HCV has already been extensively studied in the literature. This paper offers further insights in screening for HCV using cost effectiveness analysis for the impact of screening in two cohorts: Injecting Drug Users (IDUs) and Individuals With Surgery (IWSs). The setting of the cost effectiveness simulation is the Veneto Region in the North-east of Italy. Using a Markov model of the natural history of HCV infection we derive costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness related to screening vs. no-screening strategies. In the IDUs cohort, the screening strategy can result in a substantial difference in premature deaths and dominates (less costs better outcomes) the no-screening one. The overall outcomes of the screening strategy are mostly affected by the prevalence of HCV and of genotypes that are more relatively more difficult to treat (above 10% of prevalence for its cost effectiveness).

4674,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a lidocaine 5% medicated plaster compared with gabapentin and pregabalin for treating postherpetic neuralgia: a german perspective,"OBJECTIVE: This study set out to assess the cost effectiveness of using a 5% lidocaine (lignocaine) medicated plaster for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) compared with gabapentin, pregabalin 300 mg/day or 600 mg/day in German primary care. The analysis took the perspective of the Statutory Health Insurance scheme (GKV). METHODS: A Markov model was used to calculate the costs (2007) and benefits of the lidocaine plaster, gabapentin 1800 mg/day and pregabalin 300 or 600 mg/day over a 6-month time horizon in elderly patients with PHN who experienced insufficient pain relief with standard analgesics and could not tolerate or had contraindications to tricyclic antidepressants. The model calculated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and the cost per additional month without symptoms or intolerable adverse effects. The majority of transition probabilities were obtained from randomized controlled trials identified from a systematic literature review. Further model inputs, including resource use, concomitant medication and long-term efficacy/adherence data, were obtained from a Delphi panel. Utility values were taken from a previous study and age adjusted. Cost data were obtained from official price tariffs. Mortality, indirect costs and costs associated with inpatient treatment were not considered in the present analysis due to the perspective and time horizon employed. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period modelled, the mean total therapy cost per patient treated with the lidocaine plaster was euro911, compared with euro728 for gabapentin, euro875 for pregabalin 300 mg/day and euro977 for pregabalin 600 mg/day. Treatment with the lidocaine plaster was related to greater numbers of QALYs and more months without symptoms or intolerable adverse effects (mean 0.300 QALYs and 4.06 months per patient) than with gabapentin (mean 0.247 QALYs and 2.72 months), pregabalin 300 mg/day (mean 0.253 QALYs and 3.02 months) or pregabalin 600 mg/day (mean 0.256 QALYs and 3.22 months). The lidocaine plaster cost euro3453/QALY gained and euro137 per additional month without adverse effects or symptoms relative to gabapentin and euro766/QALY and euro35 per month without adverse effects or symptoms relative to pregabalin 300 mg/day. The lidocaine plaster dominated pregabalin 600 mg/day, being less costly and more effective.

4675,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a lidocaine 5% medicated plaster compared with gabapentin and pregabalin for treating postherpetic neuralgia: a german perspective,"OBJECTIVE: This study set out to assess the cost effectiveness of using a 5% lidocaine (lignocaine) medicated plaster for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) compared with gabapentin, pregabalin 300 mg/day or 600 mg/day in German primary care. The analysis took the perspective of the Statutory Health Insurance scheme (GKV). METHODS: A Markov model was used to calculate the costs (2007) and benefits of the lidocaine plaster, gabapentin 1800 mg/day and pregabalin 300 or 600 mg/day over a 6-month time horizon in elderly patients with PHN who experienced insufficient pain relief with standard analgesics and could not tolerate or had contraindications to tricyclic antidepressants. The model calculated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained and the cost per additional month without symptoms or intolerable adverse effects. The majority of transition probabilities were obtained from randomized controlled trials identified from a systematic literature review. Further model inputs, including resource use, concomitant medication and long-term efficacy/adherence data, were obtained from a Delphi panel. Utility values were taken from a previous study and age adjusted. Cost data were obtained from official price tariffs. Mortality, indirect costs and costs associated with inpatient treatment were not considered in the present analysis due to the perspective and time horizon employed. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period modelled, the mean total therapy cost per patient treated with the lidocaine plaster was euro911, compared with euro728 for gabapentin, euro875 for pregabalin 300 mg/day and euro977 for pregabalin 600 mg/day. Treatment with the lidocaine plaster was related to greater numbers of QALYs and more months without symptoms or intolerable adverse effects (mean 0.300 QALYs and 4.06 months per patient) than with gabapentin (mean 0.247 QALYs and 2.72 months), pregabalin 300 mg/day (mean 0.253 QALYs and 3.02 months) or pregabalin 600 mg/day (mean 0.256 QALYs and 3.22 months). The lidocaine plaster cost euro3453/QALY gained and euro137 per additional month without adverse effects or symptoms relative to gabapentin and euro766/QALY and euro35 per month without adverse effects or symptoms relative to pregabalin 300 mg/day.

4677,How should age at diagnosis impact treatment strategy in asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism? A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The National Institutes of Health consensus conference on asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) recommended several criteria for parathyroidectomy (PTX), including age <50 years. We hypothesized that a cost-effectiveness analysis would show PTX to be the optimal strategy for asymptomatic patients >50 years of age. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed comparing operative, observational, and pharmacologic treatments. Costs were estimated from a third-party payer perspective. Outcomes were weighted with utility adjustment factors, yielding quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3%. Threshold analysis identified the optimal strategy at life expectancies ranging from 6 months to 75 years. Multivariate sensitivity analysis was completed with Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: PTX was optimal when life expectancy reached 5 years for outpatient PTX and 6.5 years for inpatient PTX. Observation was the optimal strategy at all shorter life expectancies considered. The pharmacologic treatment strategy was not optimal at any life expectancy. CONCLUSION: PTX is the optimal strategy for many patients with asymptomatic PHPT who are >50 years of age.

4680,Cost effectiveness of interferon-gamma release assay for tuberculosis contact screening in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Nearly the entire population of Japan has been vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), which causes a false-positive result in the tuberculin skin test (TST). The interferon-gamma release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) is a new alternative to the TST that can be used to screen for latent tuberculosis infection and active tuberculosis, as it has no cross-reactivity with BCG. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the QFT for tuberculosis contact screening. The target population is a hypothetical cohort of 1000 immunocompetent 20-year-old individuals who have had contact with sputum-smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective over the lifetime of a contact. We compared the QFT-alone strategy with the TST followed by QFT (TST/QFT) strategy and the TST-alone strategy. RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, the QFT-alone strategy was dominant ($US 471.54; 28.1099 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), compared with the TST/QFT strategy ($US 500.55; 28.1087 QALYs) and the TST-alone strategy ($US573.98; 28.1079 QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the QFT-alone strategy was a cost saving of $US23 043.5/QALY gained compared with the TST/QFT strategy. On one-way sensitivity analysis, TST specificity and the prevalence of tuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection affected the cost effectiveness. The probabilistic analysis showed that the QFT-alone strategy has a 95% chance of being cost effective at a threshold ratio of $US2.10/QALY gained, compared with the TST/QFT strategy.

4682,Cost-effectiveness of extended adjuvant rituximab for US patients aged 65-70 years with follicular lymphoma in second remission,"PURPOSE: A recent Intergroup trial showed that receiving adjuvant rituximab after having a second remission from follicular lymphoma (FL) improved progression-free and overall survival (OS). The current study was conducted to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this strategy in the United States. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We constructed a transition state model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of extended adjuvant rituximab for 2 years for patients having a second FL remission. Event-free and OS rates were estimated from the recently published Intergroup trial. These were adjusted to reflect the contribution of non-cancer-specific mortality for patients aged 65-70 years, a more commonly affected age group than in the Intergroup trial, which had a median age of 54 years. Previously reported quality of life and cost estimates were obtained from peer-reviewed sources. RESULTS: Five years after a second induction with R-CHOP (rituximab with cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/ prednisone), disease-free survival is expected to be 47% and 22%, and the OS rates are estimated to be 73% and 61% for extended adjuvant rituximab and observation, respectively, during the second remission. The discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the addition of adjuvant rituximab is estimated to be $19,522 per quality-adjusted life-years gained.

4683,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a universal vaccination programmeme with the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) in Sweden,"The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7) has proved to be highly effective against invasive pneumococcal disease and has also provided some protection against all-cause pneumonia and acute otitis media. The objective of this study was to evaluate the projected health benefits, costs and cost-effectiveness of vaccination with the 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine compared with no vaccination, in all infants in Sweden, taking herd immunity into account. A Markov model was used and a hypothetical birth cohort was simulated for a lifelong perspective. The results show that vaccination of 1 cohort could potentially prevent 9 cases of pneumococcal meningitis, 22 cases of pneumococcal septicaemia, 509 cases of hospitalized pneumonia, 7812 cases of acute otitis media, and 2.7 fatalities, among children 0-4y of age and 6 episodes of pneumococcal meningitis and 167 cases of pneumococcal septicaemia among adults. The incremental cost per QALY and LY gained was estimated to euro29,200 and euro51,400, respectively. When herd immunity was accounted for, the cost per QALY and LY gained was estimated to euro5500 and euro6600, respectively.

The aim of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of HER2 testing and trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone from a societal perspective in a Swedish setting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a Markov state transition model to simulate HER2 testing and subsequent treatment in a hypothetical cohort of 65 year old metastatic breast cancer patients. Outcomes included life-time costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY), and cost per QALY gained. Five different testing and treatment strategies were evaluated. RESULTS: We estimated the cost per QALY gained to be about 485,000 SEK for the strategy of IHC testing for all patients, with FISH confirmation of 2+ and 3+, and trastuzumab and chemotherapy treatment for FISH positive patients. For the strategy of FISH testing for all patients, with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for FISH positive patients, we estimated the cost per QALY gained to about 561,000 SEK.

4687,Cost-effectiveness of maintenance rituximab treatment after second line therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma in Sweden,"INTRODUCTION: Rituximab has significantly improved the prognosis for patients with both indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. An economic evaluation was carried out to assess the cost-effectiveness in Sweden of rituximab as maintenance therapy for patients with follicular lymphoma in remission after second line therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incremental cost and effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy versus observation were evaluated in a health-state transition model. Primary effect measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and life-years gained (LYG). Model state transitions were calculated based on progression-free and overall survival data from the EORTC20981 trial. The analysis was made from the perspective of the healthcare provider, including direct medical costs presented in euro, 2007 value. Effects and costs were discounted at a 3% annual rate. The stability of the base case results were tested in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The evaluation assessed rituximab maintenance therapy to be associated with an incremental cost per QALY gained of euro 12,600 and an incremental cost per LYG of euro 11,200. The average discounted life expectancy for patients on rituximab maintenance was 1.0 year longer than for patients on observation (5.96 vs. 4.94 years). Rituximab maintenance was associated with an additional 0.9 QALY, and total costs per patient were euro 11,500 higher in the treatment arm, compared to observation. DISCUSSION: The results indicate that rituximab maintenance treatment after successful induction therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma in Sweden is cost-effective compared to observation.",2008-01-03601,18607857,Acta Oncol,Frida Kasteng,2008,47 / 6,1029-36,No,18607857,"Frida Kasteng; Martin Erlanson; Hans Hagberg; Eva Kimby; Thomas Relander; Jonas Lundkvist; Cost-effectiveness of maintenance rituximab treatment after second line therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma in Sweden, Acta Oncol, 2008; 47(6):0284-186X; 1029-36",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"rituximab maintenance vs. Observation only / (treat on relapse, unknown treatment upon relapse)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,12584,Euro,2007,21536.32

4689,A cost-effectiveness analysis of universal childhood hepatitis A vaccination in China,"The socioeconomic improvement has impacted hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection with a shift from high to intermediate endemicity in many parts of China. The first China-developed inactivated hepatitis A vaccine, with significantly low price, was licensed in 2002, prompting us to evaluate whether universal childhood vaccination is advisable now in China. We considered vaccination scheduled at ages 12 and 18 months for all healthy children, and assumed that a single cohort was enrolled in 2005. A Markov model was used to predict hepatitis A outcomes and costs. Vaccination was compared with no vaccination, and the cost-effectiveness of vaccination was evaluated from the health system and the societal perspectives. The analysis was run separately in five regions (covering all the 31 provinces of Mainland China) defined by anti-HAV prevalence (around 50%, 50-69%, 70-79%, 80-89% and 90%-). The study projects that with the Chinese low-cost vaccine, vaccination could gain quality adjusted life years (QALYs) through the whole country and save health system or societal costs in the lowest, lower, intermediate and higher infection regions. Vaccination should also be cost-effective in the highest infection region because of low additional costs per QALY gained. However, vaccination would increase the probability of death due to hepatitis A in the highest and higher infection regions by 38 and 37 per million enrolled, respectively, and as vaccine protection loss increases the risk would also occur in intermediate and lower infection regions. The trend that the lower infection level the region has, the more cost-effective vaccination would be is obvious. Sensitivity analyses prove that our conclusions are robust. Considering the potential risk of vaccination, as well as unbalanced socioeconomic developments and significant differences in HAV infection through the whole country, the study suggests that universal childhood hepatitis A vaccination should be first administrated in provinces with the lowest infection level.

4694,"Clinical and cost-effectiveness analysis of an open label, single-centre, randomised trial of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) versus percutaneous myocardial laser revascularisation (PMR) in patients with refractory angina pectoris: The SPiRiT trial","ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Patients with refractory angina have significant morbidity. This study aimed to compare two of the treatment options, Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) and Percutaneous Myocardial Laser Revascularisation (PMR) in terms of clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Eligible patients were randomised to PMR or SCS and followed up for exercise tolerance time (ETT), Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classification and the quality of life measures SF-36, Seattle Angina Questionnaire and the EuroQoL at 3, 12 and 24 months. Utilities were calculated using the EQ-5D and these and costs were compared between groups. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY for SCS compared to PMR was also calculated. RESULTS: At 24 months post-randomisation, patients that had SCS and PMR had similar ETT (mean difference 0.05, 95% CI -2.08, 2.18, p = 0.96) and there was no difference in CCS classification or quality of life outcomes. The difference in overall mean costs when comparing SCS to PMR was GBP5,520 (95% CI GBP1,966 to GBP8,613; p < 0.01) and the ICER of using SCS was GBP46,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Outcomes after SCS did not differ appreciably from those after PMR, with the former procedure being less cost-effective as currently applied. Larger studies could clarify which patients would most benefit from SCS, potentially increasing cost-effectiveness.

METHODS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab compared with no ranibizumab over 10 years, using randomized trial efficacy data for the first 2 years, post-trial efficacy assumptions, and ranibizumab acquisition costs ranging from the wholesale price ($1,950 per dose) to the price of bevazicumab ($50), a similar molecule which may be equally efficacious. We used a computer simulation model to estimate the probability of blindness, the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), direct costs (in 2004 U.S. dollars), and cost-effectiveness ratios for a 67-year old woman. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: The probability of blindness over 10 years was reduced from 56% to 34% if ranibizumab was efficacious for only 2 years, 27% if efficacy was maintained for a further 2 years only (base-case scenario), and 17% if visual acuity at 4 years was then sustained. It was cost-saving under all price assumptions, when caregiver costs were included. When caregiver costs were excluded, the cost per QALY for the base-case ranged from $5,600, assuming the bevazicumab price, to $91,900 assuming the wholesale ranibizumab price.

4697,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of therapy conversion to insulin detemir in patients with type 2 diabetes in Germany: a modelling study of long-term clinical and cost outcomes,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of transferring type 2 diabetes patients to an insulin detemir regimen after failure to achieve adequate control with oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) alone, or in combination with neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin, or with insulin glargine in Germany. METHODS: A computer simulation model of diabetes was used to make long-term projections of future clinical outcomes and direct medical costs based on findings from a German subanalysis of the PREDICTIVE trial. The study analysed the impact of converting patients failing their current treatments to an insulin detemir regimen. Therapy conversion to insulin detemir +/- OADs was associated with a significant reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1)c) compared with OADs alone, NPH insulin +/- OADs, and insulin glargine +/- OADs. Across all three groups, hypoglycaemia rates decreased by 80% and patients lost an average of 0.9 kg of body weight during treatment with insulin detemir +/- OADs. RESULTS: Therapy conversion to insulin detemir +/- OADs was projected to improve life expectancy by 0.28 years compared with OADs alone, and by 0.13 years compared with the NPH and glargine regimens. Transfer to insulin detemir was associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.21 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over OADs alone, 0.28 QALYs over NPH +/- OADs, and 0.29 QALYs over glargine +/- OADs. Insulin detemir was associated with savings over patient lifetimes due to reduced diabetes-related complications in all three comparisons.

CONCLUSIONS: Therapy conversion to insulin detemir +/- OADs in type 2 diabetes patients failing OADs alone, NPH or insulin glargine regimens was associated with improvements in life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and cost savings in all three scenarios evaluated.",2008-01-03621,18568451,Adv Ther,William J Valentine,2008,25 / 6,567-84,No,18568451,"William J Valentine; Gordon Goodall; Mark Aagren; Steffen Nielsen; Andrew J Palmer; Katrina Erny-Albrecht; Gordon Goodall; Mark Aagren; Steffen Nielsen; Andrew J Palmer; Katrina Erny-Albrecht; Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of therapy conversion to insulin detemir in patients with type 2 diabetes in Germany: a modelling study of long-term clinical and cost outcomes, Adv Ther, 2008-Jun; 25(6):0741-238X; 567-84",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Swith to an insulin detemir regimen after failure to achieve adequate control with neutral protanine hagedorn (NPH) and oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) vs. Maintain previous treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,5.00,5.00,-232.14,Euro,2006,-374.4
4699,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of therapy conversion to insulin detemir in patients with type 2 diabetes in Germany: a modelling study of long-term clinical and cost outcomes,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of transferring type 2 diabetes patients to an insulin detemir regimen after failure to achieve adequate control with oral antidiabetic agents (OADs) alone, or in combination with neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin, or with insulin glargine in Germany. METHODS: A computer simulation model of diabetes was used to make long-term projections of future clinical outcomes and direct medical costs based on findings from a German subanalysis of the PREDICTIVE trial. The study analysed the impact of converting patients failing their current treatments to an insulin detemir regimen. Therapy conversion to insulin detemir +/- OADs was associated with a significant reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA(1)c) compared with OADs alone, NPH insulin +/- OADs, and insulin glargine +/- OADs. Across all three groups, hypoglycaemia rates decreased by 80% and patients lost an average of 0.9 kg of body weight during treatment with insulin detemir +/- OADs. RESULTS: Therapy conversion to insulin detemir +/- OADs was projected to improve life expectancy by 0.28 years compared with OADs alone, and by 0.13 years compared with the NPH and glargine regimens. Transfer to insulin detemir was associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.21 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over OADs alone, 0.28 QALYs over NPH +/- OADs, and 0.29 QALYs over glargine +/- OADs. Insulin detemir was associated with savings over patient lifetimes due to reduced diabetes-related complications in all three comparisons.

4700,Modeling the cost-effectiveness of a new treatment for MS (natalizumab) compared with current standard practice in Sweden,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a new treatment (natalizumab) for multiple sclerosis (MS) compared with current standard therapy with disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) in Sweden. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to illustrate disease progression based on functional disability (the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)). The effectiveness of natalizumab was based on a 2-year clinical trial in 942 patients (AFFIRM). The effectiveness of current DMDs was estimated from a matched sample of 512 patients in the Stockholm MS registry. Patients withdrawing from treatment were assumed to follow the disease course of 824 patients with relapsing-remitting disease at onset in the Ontario natural history cohort. Costs and utilities are based on a recent observational study in 1339 patients. All data sets were available at the patient level. Main results are presented from the societal perspective, over a 20-year time frame, in 2005 Euros (euro1 = 9.25 SEK). RESULTS: In the base case, treatment with natalizumab was less expensive and more effective than treatment with current DMDs. When only healthcare costs were considered, the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained with natalizumab was euro38 145. Results are sensitive only to the time horizon of the analysis and assumptions about effectiveness of natalizumab beyond the trial. CONCLUSIONS: This cost-effectiveness analysis used registry data, cohort and observational studies to extrapolate the efficacy findings of natalizumab from the AFFIRM clinical trial to measure effectiveness in clinical practice. The analysis results suggest that for the population considered, natalizumab provides an additional health benefit at a similar cost to current DMDs from a societal perspective.",2008-01-03623,18566030,Mult Scler,G Kobelt,2008,14 / 5,679-90,No,18566030,"G Kobelt; J Berg; P Lindgren; B Jonsson; L Stawiarz; J Hillert; J Berg; P Lindgren; B Jonsson; L Stawiarz; J Hillert; Modeling the cost-effectiveness of a new treatment for MS (natalizumab) compared with current standard practice in Sweden, Mult Scler, 2008-Jun; 14(5):1352-4585; 679-90",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Natalizumab vs. Treatment with current disease-modifying drugs,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,-11264.71,Euro,2005,-18583.38
