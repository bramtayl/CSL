32001,The potential economic value of a therapeutic Chagas disease vaccine for pregnant women to prevent congenital transmission,"BACKGROUND: Currently, there are no solutions to prevent congenital transmission of Chagas disease during pregnancy, which affects 1-40% of pregnant women in Latin America and is associated with a 5% transmission risk. With therapeutic vaccines under development, now is the right time to determine the economic value of such a vaccine to prevent congenital transmission. METHODS: We developed a computational decision model that represented the clinical outcomes and diagnostic testing strategies for an infant born to a Chagas-positive woman in Mexico and evaluated the impact of vaccination. RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, a 25% efficacious vaccine averted 125 [95% uncertainty interval (UI): 122-128] congenital cases, 1.9 (95% UI: 1.6-2.2) infant deaths, and 78 (95% UI: 66-91) DALYs per 10,000 infected pregnant women; a 50% efficacious vaccine averted 251 (95% UI: 248-254) cases, 3.8 (95% UI: 3.6-4.2) deaths, and 160 (95% UI: 148-171) DALYs; and a 75% efficacious vaccine averted 376 (95% UI: 374-378) cases, 5.8 (95% UI: 5.5-6.1) deaths, and 238 (95% UI: 227-249) DALYs. A 25% efficacious vaccine was cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <3× Mexico''s gross domestic product per capita, <$29,698/DALY averted) when the vaccine cost =$240 and =$310 and cost-saving when =$10 and =$80 from the third-party payer and societal perspectives, respectively. A 50% efficacious vaccine was cost-effective when costing =$490 and =$615 and cost-saving when =$25 and =$160, from the third-party payer and societal perspectives, respectively. A 75% efficacious vaccine was cost-effective when =$720 and =$930 and cost-saving when =$40 and =$250 from the third-party payer and societal perspectives, respectively. Additionally, 13-42 fewer infants progressed to chronic disease, saving $0.41-$1.21 million to society. CONCLUSION: We delineated the thresholds at which therapeutic vaccination of Chagas-positive pregnant women would be cost-effective and cost-saving, providing economic guidance for decision-makers to consider when developing and bringing such a vaccine to market.",2020-99-39211,32171575,Vaccine,Sarah M Bartsch,2020,38 / 16,3261-3270,Yes,32171575,"Sarah M Bartsch; Owen J Stokes-Cawley; Pierre Buekens; Lindsey Asti; Maria Elena Bottazzi; Ulrich Strych; Patrick T Wedlock; Elizabeth A Mitgang; Sheba Meymandi; Jorge Abelardo Falcon-Lezama; Peter J Hotez; Bruce Y Lee; The potential economic value of a therapeutic Chagas disease vaccine for pregnant women to prevent congenital transmission, Vaccine, 2020 Apr 3; 38(16):1873-2518; 3261-3270",DALY,Mexico,Not Stated,Immunization,25% efficacy at $50 vaccination for chagas disease vs. None,pregnant,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,-30729.83,United States,2019,-31108.94

32022,Potential cost-effectiveness of a maternal Group B streptococcal vaccine in The Gambia,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate neonatal health benefits and healthcare provider costs of a theoretical Group B streptococcal (GBS) hexavalent maternal vaccination programme in The Gambia, a low-income setting in West Africa. METHODS: A static decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was developed from the healthcare provider perspective. Demographic data and acute care costs were available from studies in The Gambia undertaken in 2012-2015. Further model parameters were taken from United Nations and World Health Organisation sources, supplemented by data from a global systematic review of GBS and literature searches. As vaccine efficacy is not known, we simulated vaccine efficacy estimates of 50-90%. Costs are reported in US dollars. Cost-effectiveness thresholds of one (US$473, very cost effective) and three (US$1420, cost effective) times Gambian GDP were used. RESULTS: Vaccination with a hexavalent vaccine would avert 24 GBS disease cases (55%) and 768 disability adjusted life years compared to current standard of care (no interventions to prevent GBS disease). At vaccine efficacy of 70%, the programme is cost-effective at a maximum vaccine price per dose of 12 US$ (2016 US$), and very cost-effective at a maximum of $3/dose. The total costs of vaccination at $12 is $1,056,962 for one annual cohort of Gambian pregnant women. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that GBS incidence was the most influential parameter on the cost effectiveness ratio. CONCLUSION: The introduction of a hexavalent vaccine would considerably reduce the current burden of GBS disease in The Gambia but to be cost-effective, the vaccine price per dose would need to be $12/dose or less.",2020-99-35782,32147298,Vaccine,N Ahmed,2020,38 / 15,3096-3104,Yes,32147298,"N Ahmed; K Giorgakoudi; E Usuf; U Okomo; E Clarke; B Kampmann; K Le Doare; C Trotter; Potential cost-effectiveness of a maternal Group B streptococcal vaccine in The Gambia, Vaccine, 2020 Mar 30; 38(15):1873-2518; 3096-3104",DALY,Gambia,Not Stated,"Immunization, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care",group b streptococcus immunization vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,", Lifetime",3.00,3.00,1420,United States,2016,1531.25

Yet, South African men face considerable HIV risk. We estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of providing oral PrEP, injectable PrEP, or a combination of both to heterosexual South African men to assess whether providing PrEP would efficiently use resources. METHODS: Epidemiological and costing models estimated the one-year costs and outcomes associated with PrEP use in 3 scenarios. PrEP uptake was estimated for younger (aged 18-24) and older (aged 25-49) men using a discrete choice experiment. Scenarios were compared with a baseline scenario of male condom use, while a health system perspective was used to estimate discounted lifetime costs averted per HIV infection. PrEP benefit was estimated in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Uncertainty around the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: No PrEP intervention scenarios were cost-effective for both age groups at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $1175/DALY averted. The lowest ICER ($2873/DALY averted) was for the provision of oral PrEP to older men, although probability of cost-effectiveness was just 0.26%. Results found that ICERs were sensitive to HIV incidence and antiretroviral coverage. CONCLUSIONS: This study estimates that providing PrEP to heterosexual South African men is not cost-effective at current cost-effectiveness thresholds.

32029,A Mobile Phone-Based Support Intervention to Increase Use of Postabortion Family Planning in Cambodia: Cost-Effectiveness Evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Despite progress over the last decade, there is a continuing unmet need for contraception in Cambodia. Interventions delivered by mobile phone could help increase uptake and continuation of contraception, particularly among hard-to-reach populations, by providing interactive personalized support inexpensively wherever the person is located and whenever needed. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mobile phone-based support added to standard postabortion family planning care in Cambodia, according to the results of the MOTIF (MObile Technology for Improved Family planning) trial. METHODS: A model was created to estimate the costs and effects of the intervention versus standard care. We adopted a societal perspective when estimating costs, including direct and indirect costs for users. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for the base case, as well as a deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis, which we compared against a range of likely cost-effectiveness thresholds. RESULTS: The incremental cost of mobile phone-based support was estimated to be an additional US $8160.49 per 1000 clients, leading to an estimated 518 couple-years of protection (CYPs) gained per 1000 clients and 99 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US $15.75 per additional CYP and US $82.57 per DALY averted. The model was most sensitive to personnel and mobile service costs. Assuming a range of cost-effectiveness thresholds from US $58 to US $176 for Cambodia, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective ranged from 11% to 95%. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the cost-effectiveness of the intervention delivered by mobile phone assessed in the MOTIF trial lies within the estimated range of the cost-effectiveness threshold for Cambodia. When assessing value in interventions to improve the uptake and adherence of family planning services, the use of interactive mobile phone messaging and counselling for women who have had an abortion should be considered as an option by policy makers.

32030,Cost utility analysis of HIV pre exposure prophylaxis among men who have sex with men in Israel,"BACKGROUND: Between 2011 and 2015, Men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for nearly half of new HIV cases among men in Israel. This study carries out a cost-utility analysis of PrEP (HIV Pre Exposure Prophylaxis), an antiretroviral medication that can protect against the acquisition of HIV infection, whose incidence rate in Israel is around 1.74 per 1000 MSM. METHOD: Epidemiological, demographic, health service utilisation and economic data were integrated into a spread-sheet model in order to calculate the cost per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of the intervention from a societal perspective, in mid-2018 US$ using a 3% discount rate. Cost utility analyses were performed for both types of PrEP delivery (continuous regimen and on-demand), together with sensitivity analyses on numbers of condom users who take up PrEP (baseline 25%) and subsequently abandon condom use (baseline 75%), PrEP efficacy (baseline 86%), PrEP prices and monitoring costs. RESULTS: Around 21.3% of MSM are high risk (as defined by having unprotected anal intercourse). Offering PrEP to this group would have a ten year net cost of around 1563 million USD, preventing 493 persons from becoming HIV-positive, averting around 1616 DALYs at a cost per averted DALY of around 967,744 USD. This will render the intervention to be not cost-effective. PrEP drug prices would have to fall dramatically (by 90.7%) for the intervention to become cost-effective (i.e. having a cost per averted DALY less than thrice GNP per capita) in Israel. PrEP remains not cost-effective (at 475,673 USD per averted DALY) even if intervention costs were reduced by using an ""on demand"" instead of a daily schedule. Even if there were no changes in condom use, the resultant 411,694 USD cost-utility ratio is still not cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Despite PrEPs high effectiveness against HIV, PrEP was found not to be cost-effective in the Israeli context because of a combination of relatively low HIV incidence, high PrEP costs, with a likelyhood that some low-risk MSM (ie: who use condoms) may well begin taking PrEP and as a consequence many of these will abandon condom use.

32033,Japanese encephalitis vaccination in the Philippines: A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing alternative delivery strategies,"INTRODUCTION: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne viral infection of the brain that can cause permanent brain damage and death. In the Philippines, efforts are underway to deliver a live attenuated JE vaccine (CD-JEV) to children under five years of age (YOA), who are disproportionately infected. Multiple vaccination strategies are being considered. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing three vaccination strategies to the current state of no vaccination from the societal and government perspectives: (1) national routine vaccination only, (2) sub-national campaign followed by national routine, and (3) national campaign followed by national routine. We developed a Markov model to estimate impact of vaccination or no vaccination over the child''s lifetime horizon, assuming an annual incidence of 10.6 cases per 100,000. Costs of illness ($859/case), vaccine ($0.50/dose), routine vaccination ($0.95/dose), and campaign vaccination ($0.98/dose) were based on hospital financial records, expert opinion and literature. The societal perspective included transportation and opportunity costs of caregiver time, in addition to costs incurred by the health system. RESULTS: JE vaccination via national campaign followed by national routine delivery was the most cost-effective strategy modeled with a cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted of $233 and $29 from the government and societal perspectives, respectively. Results were similar for other delivery strategies with cost/DALY ranging from $233 to $265 from the government perspective and $29-$57 from the societal perspective. JE vaccination was projected to prevent 27,856-37,277 cases, 5571-7455 deaths, and 173,233-230,704 DALYs among children under five over 20 consecutive birth cohorts. Total incremental costs of vaccination versus no vaccination over 20 birth cohorts were $6.6-$9.8 million from the societal perspective ($230 K-$440 K annually) and $45.9-$53.9 million ($2.2 M-$2.7 M annually) from the governmental perspective.

32043,Updated assessment of risks and benefits of dolutegravir versus efavirenz in new antiretroviral treatment initiators in sub-Saharan Africa: modelling to inform treatment guidelines,"BACKGROUND: The integrase inhibitor dolutegravir is being considered in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa instead of efavirenz for people initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) because of superior tolerability and a lower risk of resistance emergence. WHO requested updated modelling results for its 2019 Antiretroviral Guidelines update, which was restricted to the choice of dolutegravir or efavirenz in new ART initiators. In response to this request, we modelled the risks and benefits of alternative policies for initial first-line ART regimens. METHODS: We updated an existing individual-based model of HIV transmission and progression in adults to consider information on the risk of neural tube defects in women taking dolutegravir at time of conception, as well as the effects of dolutegravir on weight gain. The model accounted for drug resistance in determining viral suppression, with consequences for clinical outcomes and mother-to-child transmission. We sampled distributions of parameters to create various epidemic setting scenarios, which reflected the diversity of epidemic and programmatic situations in sub-Saharan Africa. For each setting scenario, we considered the situation in 2018 and compared ART initiation policies of an efavirenz-based regimen in women intending pregnancy, and a dolutegravir-based regimen in others, and a dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy. We considered predicted outcomes over a 20-year period from 2019 to 2039, used a 3% discount rate, and a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$500 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. FINDINGS: Considering updated information on risks and benefits, a policy of ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen rather than an efavirenz-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, is predicted to bring population health benefits (10?990 DALYs averted per year) and to be cost-saving (by $2·9 million per year), leading to a reduction in the overall population burden of disease of 16?735 net DALYs per year for a country with an adult population size of 10 million. The policy involving ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen in women intending pregnancy was cost-effective in 87% of our setting scenarios and this finding was robust in various sensitivity analyses, including around the potential negative effects of weight gain. INTERPRETATION: In the context of a range of modelled setting scenarios in sub-Saharan Africa, we found that a policy of ART initiation with a dolutegravir-based regimen, including in women intending pregnancy, was predicted to bring population health benefits and be cost-effective, supporting WHO''s strong recommendation for dolutegravir as a preferred drug for ART initiators.

32044,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of group support psychotherapy delivered by trained lay health workers for depression treatment among people with HIV in Uganda: a cluster-randomised trial,"BACKGROUND: WHO recommends the use of psychological interventions as first-line treatment for depression in low-income and middle-income countries. However, evaluations of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such interventions among people with HIV are scarce. Our aim was to establish the effectiveness of group support psychotherapy (GSP) delivered by lay health workers for depression treatment among people living with HIV in a rural area of Uganda on a large scale. METHODS: In this cluster-randomised trial, we included 30 health centres offering HIV care. These were randomly assigned to deliver either GSP or group HIV education (GHE). Randomisation, in a ratio of 1:1, was achieved by health centre managers separately picking a paper containing the intervention allocation from a basket. Participants were people living with HIV, aged 19 years and older, with mild to moderate major depression assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview depression module, taking antiretroviral therapy, and antidepressant-naive. Group sessions were led by trained lay health workers once a week for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants with major depression and function scores at 6 months post-treatment, analysed by intention to treat by means of multilevel random effect regression analyses adjusting for clustering in health centres. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, PACTR201608001738234. FINDINGS: Between Sept 13 and Dec 15, 2016, we assessed 1473 individuals, of whom 1140 were recruited from health centres offering GSP (n=578 [51%]) or GHE (n=562 [49%]). Two (<1%) participants in the GSP group were diagnosed with major depression 6 months post-treatment compared with 160 (28%) in the GHE group (adjusted odds ratio=0·01, 95% CI 0·003-0·012, p<0·0001). The mean function scores 6 months post-treatment were 9·85 (SD 0·76) in the GSP group and 6·83 (2·85) in the GHE group (ß=4·12; 95% CI 3·75-4·49, p<0·0001). 36 individuals had 63 serious adverse events, which included 25 suicide attempts and 22 hospital admissions for medical complications. The outcomes of these serious adverse events included 16 deaths, 4 of which were completed suicides (GSP=2; GHE=2), and 12 of which were HIV-related medical complications (GSP=8; GHE=4). Cost-effectiveness estimates showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$13·0 per disability-adjusted life-year averted, which can be considered very cost-effective in Uganda. INTERPRETATION: Integration of cost-effective psychological treatments such as group support psychotherapy into existing HIV interventions might improve the mental health of people living with HIV.

An extended cost-effectiveness analysis of small incision surgery,"Treatment costs remain a barrier for having timely cataract surgery in Vietnam, particularly for females and the poor, despite significant progress in achieving universal health coverage (UHC). This study evaluated the potential impact, on health and financial protection, of eliminating medical and non-medical out-of-pocket costs associated with cataract surgery. An extended cost-effectiveness analysis (ECEA) was conducted with a societal perspective. The ECEA modelled how many more disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and cases of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and medical impoverishment could be averted across income quintiles and between males and females. Two programmes were evaluated: (1) eliminating medical out-of-pocket costs for small incision cataract surgery and (2) Programme A plus a voucher programme covering non-medical out-of-pocket costs. Compared with current, the incremental cost per year of Programme A was estimated to be $833 396 and $1 641 835 for Programme B, each representing <0.01% of total health care spending in 2016. Males and females in the richest income quintiles would avert more DALYs than those in the poorest quintiles. For both programmes, most cases of CHE would be averted by individuals in the poorest income quintile. Programme B would avert the most CHE cases overall and females would have a greater share of benefits. All cases of impoverishing medical expenditure would be averted by individuals in the poorest quintile (A: 115 cases and B: 493 cases) for both programmes. The cost to avert each case of CHE with Programme A ranged from $67 to $292 and $100 to $232 for Programme B. We found a pro-rich health distribution and a pro-poor CHE distribution associated with eliminating out-of-pocket costs of cataract surgery in Vietnam.

Two programmes were evaluated: (1) eliminating medical out-of-pocket costs for small incision cataract surgery and (2) Programme A plus a voucher programme covering non-medical out-of-pocket costs. Compared with current, the incremental cost per year of Programme A was estimated to be $833 396 and $1 641 835 for Programme B, each representing <0.01% of total health care spending in 2016. Males and females in the richest income quintiles would avert more DALYs than those in the poorest quintiles. For both programmes, most cases of CHE would be averted by individuals in the poorest income quintile. Programme B would avert the most CHE cases overall and females would have a greater share of benefits. All cases of impoverishing medical expenditure would be averted by individuals in the poorest quintile (A: 115 cases and B: 493 cases) for both programmes. The cost to avert each case of CHE with Programme A ranged from $67 to $292 and $100 to $232 for Programme B. We found a pro-rich health distribution and a pro-poor CHE distribution associated with eliminating out-of-pocket costs of cataract surgery in Vietnam.

32065,Cost effectiveness of a novel device for improving resuscitation of apneic newborns,"BACKGROUND: Intrapartum-related hypoxic events are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in low resource countries. Neonates who receive proper resuscitation may go on to live otherwise healthy lives. However, even when a birth attendant is present, these babies frequently receive suboptimal ventilation with poor outcomes. The Augmented Infant Resuscitator (AIR) is a low-cost, reusable device designed to provide birth attendants real-time objective feedback on measures of ventilation quality during resuscitations and is intended for use in training and at the point of care. The goal of our study was to determine the impact and cost-effectiveness of AIR deployment in conjunction with existing resuscitation training programs in low resource settings. METHODS: We developed a simulation model of the natural history of intrapartum-related neonatal hypoxia and resuscitation deriving parameters from published literature and model calibration. Simulations estimated the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted with use of the AIR by birth attendants if deployed at the point of care. Potential decreases in neonatal mortality and long-term subsequent morbidity from disability were modeled over a lifetime horizon. The primary outcome for the analysis was the cost per DALY averted. Model parameters were specific to the Mbeya region of Tanzania. RESULTS: Implementation of the AIR strategy resulted in an additional cost of $24.44 (4.80, 73.62) per DALY averted on top of the cost of existing, validated resuscitation programs. Per hospital, this adds an extra $656 to initial training costs and averts approximately 26.84?years of disability in the cohort of children born in the first year, when projected over a lifetime. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. Total roll-out costs for AIR are estimated at $422,688 for the Mbeya region, averting approximately 9018 DALYs on top of existing resuscitation programs, which are estimated to cost $202,240 without AIR. CONCLUSION: Our modeling analysis finds that use of the AIR device may be both an effective and cost-effective tool when used as a supplement to existing resuscitation training programs. Implementation of this strategy in multiple settings will provide data to improve our model parameters and potentially confirm our findings.",2020-99-36783,32000740,BMC Pediatr,Ayman Ali,2020,20 / 1,46,No,32000740,"Ayman Ali; Jacob Nudel; Curtis R Heberle; Data Santorino; Kristian R Olson; Chin Hur; Cost effectiveness of a novel device for improving resuscitation of apneic newborns, BMC Pediatr, 2020 Mar 25; 20(1):1471-2431; 46",DALY,Tanzania,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Diagnostic, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Medical Device",augmented infant resuscitator vs. Standard/Usual Care- helping babies breathe training,mbeya region,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,24.44,United States,2014,26.72
32066,Cost-effectiveness of diagnostic algorithms including lateral-flow urine lipoarabinomannan for HIV-positive patients with symptoms of tuberculosis,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among HIV-positive patients. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of including lateral-flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LF-LAM) in TB diagnostic algorithms for severely ill or immunosuppressed HIV-positive patients with symptoms of TB in Kenya. METHODS: From a decision-analysis tree, ten diagnostic algorithms were elaborated and compared. All algorithms included clinical exam. The costs of each algorithm were calculated using a ''micro-costing'' method. The efficacy was estimated through a prospective study that included severely ill or immunosuppressed (CD4<200cells/µL) HIV-positive adults with symptoms of TB. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted as effectiveness outcome. A 4% discount rate was applied. RESULTS: The algorithm that added LF-LAM alone to the clinical exam lead to the least average cost per TB case detected (€47) and was the most cost-effective with a cost/DALY averted of €4.6. The algorithms including LF-LAM, microscopy and X-ray, and LF-LAM and Xpert in sputum, detected a high number of TB cases with a cost/DALY averted of €6.1 for each of them. In the comparisons of the algorithms two by two, using LF-LAM instead of microscopy (clinic&LAM vs clinic&microscopy) and using LF-LAM along with GeneXpert in sputum instead of GeneXpert in urine along with GeneXpert in sputum, (clinic&LAM&Xpert_sputum vs clinic&Xpert_sputum&Xpert_urine) led to the highest increase in the cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs): €-7.2 and €-12.6 respectively. In these two comparisons, using LF-LAM increased the number of TB patients detected while reducing costs. Adding LF-LAM to smear microscopy alone or to smear microscopy and Xray led to the highest increase in the additional number of TB cases detected (31 and 25 respectively) with an incremental efficiency estimated at 134 and 344 DALYs respectively.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed (to represent 2019 circumstances, US$ and INT$, Region of the Americas) to simulate a woman of childbearing age and the potential risk and clinical course of a Zika infection. RESULTS: Compared with no vaccination, vaccination was cost effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: US$1,254-$82,900/disability-adjusted life years averted) when the risk of infection was =0.05%-0.08% (varying with country income), vaccine efficacy was =25%, and vaccination cost was US$1-$7,500 (INT$5-$10,000 depending on country income level).

32080,Screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in high-risk groups of diabetic patients,"BACKGROUND: The double burden of diabetes mellitus (DM) and tuberculosis (TB) has attracted increasing attention, because DM not only increases the risk of active TB but also affects treatment outcomes. Screening for TB among diabetic patients has been recommended, but requires real-world evidence by considering its cost-effectiveness, cost-utility ratio, and cost-benefit ratio. METHODS: A screening program was conducted in Jiangyin City of Jiangsu Province, China. A total of 14 869 diabetic patients received regular physical examinations for three consecutive years and were followed for the diagnosis of TB. The cost of screening and the effectiveness, utility, and social benefits attributed to the program were evaluated. In addition, a matched case-control study was conducted and the nomogram was used to identify high-risk groups that could be the target population for screening. RESULTS: Among the 14 869 diabetic patients who participated in this screening program, 22 were diagnosed with TB, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 83 910 CNY per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) gained and a cost-benefit ratio of 0.50. If the screening program was limited to high-risk diabetic patients by considering body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and triglycerides, the ICER decreased to 34 303 CNY per DALY gained and the cost-benefit ratio increased to 1.22. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for TB using regular chest X-ray examinations is feasible but not economical in areas with a low incidence of TB. It is recommended that diabetic patients with a low BMI, high FBG, and low triglycerides are selected as subjects for TB screening.",2020-XX-33995,31978585,Int J Infect Dis,Ye Ji,2020,93 /,84-89,No,31978585,"Ye Ji; Hengfu Cao; Qiao Liu; Zhongqi Li; Huan Song; Dian Xu; Dan Tian; Beibei Qiu; Jianming Wang; Adi Eldar-Lissai; Joshua T Cohen; Samantha Meltzer-Brody; Margaret E Gerbasi; Elizabeth Chertavian; Paul Hodgkins; Julia C Bond; Scott J Johnson; Screening for pulmonary tuberculosis in high-risk groups of diabetic patients, Int J Infect Dis, 2020 Apr; 93():1201-9712; 84-89",DALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening,chest X-ray exam for tuberculosis screening vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,83910,China,2018,13085.85

METHODS: We use a difference-in-differences (or two-way fixed effects) research design: we investigate whether diseases for which more new drugs were launched had larger subsequent reductions in mortality. This design controls for the effects of general economic and societal factors (e.g. income, education, and behavioral risk factors), to the extent that those effects are similar across diseases. RESULTS: New Chemical Entities launched during 1983-1997 are estimated to have reduced the total number of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost in 2015 by about 234 600.

32082,A cost-effectiveness analysis of traditional and geographic information system-supported microplanning approaches for routine immunization program management in northern Nigeria,"Effective RI microplanning requires accurate population estimates and maps showing health facilities and locations of villages and target populations. Traditional microplanning relies on census figures to project target populations and on community estimates of distances, while GIS microplanning uses satellite imagery to estimate target populations and spatial analyses to estimate distances. This paper estimates the cost-effectiveness of geographical information systems (GIS)-based microplanning for routine immunization (RI) programming in two states in northern Nigeria. For our cost-effectiveness analysis, we captured the cost of all inputs for both approaches to capture the incremental cost of GIS over traditional microplanning and present the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for each vaccine-preventable illness, death, and disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. We considered two scenarios for estimating vaccine requirements for each microplanning approach, one based on administrative vaccination coverage rates and one based on National Nutrition and Health Survey rates. With the administrative rates, GIS microplanning projected approximately 194,000 and 157,000 more required vaccinations than traditional microplanning in Bauchi and Sokoto States; with the survey rates, the additional number of vaccinations required was nearly 113,000 in Bauchi and about 47,000 in Sokoto. For each state under each scenario, we present numbers of and costs per measles and pertussis cases, deaths, and DALYs averted by the additional vaccinations, as well as annual costs. As expected, GIS-based microplanning incurs higher costs than traditional microplanning, due mainly to the additional vaccinations required for populations previously unreached.

32086,When and what to test for: A cost-effectiveness analysis of febrile illness test-and-treat strategies in the era of responsible antibiotic use,"BACKGROUND: Febrile illness caused by viral and bacterial diseases (e.g., dengue and leptospirosis) often have similar symptoms and are difficult to differentiate without diagnostic tests. If not treated appropriately, patients may experience serious complications. The question of what diagnostic tests to make available to providers in order to inform antibiotic therapy remains an open problem for health services facing limited resources. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We formulated the problem of minimizing the weighted average of antibiotic underuse and overuse to inform the optimal diagnostic test and antibiotic treatment options for given occurrence probabilities of several bacterial and viral infections. We modeled the weight of antibiotic overuse as a monetary penalty per unnecessarily administered course, which we varied in both the base case and sensitivity analysis. Detailed Markov cohort models of febrile illness progression were used to estimate the weight of antibiotic underuse. The model accounted for multiple infections simultaneously and incorporated test, treatment, and other direct and indirect costs, as well as the effect of delays in seeking care and test turnaround times. We used the Markov models to numerically estimate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), pre-penalty costs, and likelihood of antibiotics overuse per patient for fifteen different strategies in two example settings in Thailand, one with a higher probability of bacterial infections (Northern Thailand, Scenario A) and one with a higher probability of viral infections (Bangkok, Scenario B). We found that empirical antibiotic treatment to all patients always incurs the lowest pre-penalty cost (Scenario A: $47.5/patient, $100.6/patient, $149.5/patient for patients seeking care on day one, day four, and day ten respectively; Scenario B: $94.1/patient, $108.7/patient, $122.1/patient on day one, day four, and day ten respectively), and the lowest DALYs, (Scenario A: 0.2 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient, 1.7 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 0.5 DALYs/patient, 0.7 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). However, such strategy resulted in the highest proportion of antibiotic overuse per patient (Scenario A: 38.1%, 19.3%, 7.5% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 82.9%, 42.1%, 16.3% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). Consequently, empirical antibiotic treatment became suboptimal with antibiotic overuse penalties above $12,800/course, $18,400/course, $23,900/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario A and above $1,100/course, $1,500/course, $1,600/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario B. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical antibiotic treatment to all patients provided the best outcomes if antibiotic overuse was not the primary concern or if presenting with viral disease (such as dengue) was unlikely. Empirical antibiotic treatment to severe patients only was in most cases not beneficial. Otherwise, strategies involving diagnostic tests became optimal. In particular, our results indicated that single test strategies (bacterial RDT or viral PCR) were optimal in regions with a greater probability of presenting with viral infection.

If not treated appropriately, patients may experience serious complications. The question of what diagnostic tests to make available to providers in order to inform antibiotic therapy remains an open problem for health services facing limited resources. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We formulated the problem of minimizing the weighted average of antibiotic underuse and overuse to inform the optimal diagnostic test and antibiotic treatment options for given occurrence probabilities of several bacterial and viral infections. We modeled the weight of antibiotic overuse as a monetary penalty per unnecessarily administered course, which we varied in both the base case and sensitivity analysis. Detailed Markov cohort models of febrile illness progression were used to estimate the weight of antibiotic underuse. The model accounted for multiple infections simultaneously and incorporated test, treatment, and other direct and indirect costs, as well as the effect of delays in seeking care and test turnaround times. We used the Markov models to numerically estimate disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), pre-penalty costs, and likelihood of antibiotics overuse per patient for fifteen different strategies in two example settings in Thailand, one with a higher probability of bacterial infections (Northern Thailand, Scenario A) and one with a higher probability of viral infections (Bangkok, Scenario B). We found that empirical antibiotic treatment to all patients always incurs the lowest pre-penalty cost (Scenario A: $47.5/patient, $100.6/patient, $149.5/patient for patients seeking care on day one, day four, and day ten respectively; Scenario B: $94.1/patient, $108.7/patient, $122.1/patient on day one, day four, and day ten respectively), and the lowest DALYs, (Scenario A: 0.2 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient, 1.7 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 0.5 DALYs/patient, 0.7 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). However, such strategy resulted in the highest proportion of antibiotic overuse per patient (Scenario A: 38.1%, 19.3%, 7.5% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 82.9%, 42.1%, 16.3% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). Consequently, empirical antibiotic treatment became suboptimal with antibiotic overuse penalties above $12,800/course, $18,400/course, $23,900/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario A and above $1,100/course, $1,500/course, $1,600/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario B.

We found that empirical antibiotic treatment to all patients always incurs the lowest pre-penalty cost (Scenario A: $47.5/patient, $100.6/patient, $149.5/patient for patients seeking care on day one, day four, and day ten respectively; Scenario B: $94.1/patient, $108.7/patient, $122.1/patient on day one, day four, and day ten respectively), and the lowest DALYs, (Scenario A: 0.2 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient, 1.7 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 0.5 DALYs/patient, 0.7 DALYs/patient, 0.9 DALYs/patient on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). However, such strategy resulted in the highest proportion of antibiotic overuse per patient (Scenario A: 38.1%, 19.3%, 7.5% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively; Scenario B: 82.9%, 42.1%, 16.3% on day one, day four, and day ten, respectively). Consequently, empirical antibiotic treatment became suboptimal with antibiotic overuse penalties above $12,800/course, $18,400/course, $23,900/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario A and above $1,100/course, $1,500/course, $1,600/course for patients presenting on day one, day four, and day ten in Scenario B. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical antibiotic treatment to all patients provided the best outcomes if antibiotic overuse was not the primary concern or if presenting with viral disease (such as dengue) was unlikely. Empirical antibiotic treatment to severe patients only was in most cases not beneficial. Otherwise, strategies involving diagnostic tests became optimal. In particular, our results indicated that single test strategies (bacterial RDT or viral PCR) were optimal in regions with a greater probability of presenting with viral infection. PCR-led strategies (e.g., parallel bacterial PCR, or multiplex PCR) are robust under parameter uncertainty (e.g., with uncertain disease occurrence probabilities).",2020-99-39484,31914143,PLoS One,Anthony Zhenhuan Zhang,2020,15 / 1,e0227409,No,31914143,"Anthony Zhenhuan Zhang; Diana Negoescu; Claudia Munoz-Zanzi; When and what to test for: A cost-effectiveness analysis of febrile illness test-and-treat strategies in the era of responsible antibiotic use, PLoS One , 2020; 15(1):1932-6203; e0227409",DALY,Thailand,Not Stated,"Diagnostic, Pharmaceutical",lepto rapid diagnostic test + typhus pcr test vs. None,Northern Thailand (Bacterial disease is predominant),40 Years,40 Years,Not Stated,Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,-39.75,United States,2018,-40.97
32099,When and what to test for: A cost-effectiveness analysis of febrile illness test-and-treat strategies in the era of responsible antibiotic use,"BACKGROUND: Febrile illness caused by viral and bacterial diseases (e.g., dengue and leptospirosis) often have similar symptoms and are difficult to differentiate without diagnostic tests. If not treated appropriately, patients may experience serious complications. The question of what diagnostic tests to make available to providers in order to inform antibiotic therapy remains an open problem for health services facing limited resources. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We formulated the problem of minimizing the weighted average of antibiotic underuse and overuse to inform the optimal diagnostic test and antibiotic treatment options for given occurrence probabilities of several bacterial and viral infections. We modeled the weight of antibiotic overuse as a monetary penalty per unnecessarily administered course, which we varied in both the base case and sensitivity analysis. Detailed Markov cohort models of febrile illness progression were used to estimate the weight of antibiotic underuse.
