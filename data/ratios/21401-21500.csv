21401,Estimating the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness profile of a nonavalent HPV vaccine in Spain,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the main causes of infection-related cancer. The bivalent vaccine (2vHPV) (16/18) and quadrivalent (6/11/16/18) HPV vaccine (4vHPV) have been included in the Spanish vaccination calendar since 2007. The new nonavalent HPV vaccine (9vHPV), approved in Europe in 2015, includes nine HPV types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 and has been available in Spain since May 2017. Our study aims to estimate the epidemiological impact and the cost-effectiveness of a girls-only and a gender-neutral vaccination program with 9vHPV compared to the current vaccination program in Spain. A dynamic transmission model simulating the natural history of HPV infections was calibrated to the Spanish setting and applied to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with vaccination strategies using a payer perspective and a 100-year time horizon. A girls-only vaccination strategy at age 12 years with 9vHPV was found to be a cost-effective strategy compared with 4vHPV (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro7,718 per QALY). Compared with girls-only vaccination with 4vHPV, gender-neutral vaccination with 9vHPV was associated with further reductions of up to 28.5% in the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 2/3 and 17.1% in the incidence of cervical cancer, as well as with a 14.0% reduction in cervical cancer mortality. Furthermore, a gender-neutral vaccination program with 9vHPV could potentially be cost-effective considering some parameters as head and neck protection or discount rates, leading to a reduction in the burden of HPV-related diseases in both sexes in the Spanish population.",2019-01-30527,30698488,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Jesus De La Fuente,2019,/,1-13,No,30698488,"Jesus De La Fuente; Juan Jose Hernandez Aguado; Maria San Martin; Paula Ramirez Boix; Sergio Cedillo; Noelia Lopez; Estimating the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness profile of a nonavalent HPV vaccine in Spain, Hum Vaccin Immunother , 2019 May 20; ():2164-554X; 1-13",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Immunization,9vhpv nonavalent vaccine vs. 9vHPV Girls,Not Stated,14 Years,9 Years,"Female, Male",Full,100 Years,3.00,3.00,53244,Euro,2017,63529.1
21402,Cost-Effectiveness of Adding Androgen Deprivation Therapy to Radiation Therapy for Men with Advanced Prostate Cancer from a U.S. Payer's Perspective,"BACKGROUND: No study has investigated the cost and effectiveness of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other curative treatment therapies among the Medicare population, and no study has taken into consideration the long-term side effects associated with ADT. OBJECTIVE: To examine if adding ADT was cost-effective when accounting for ADT-related long-term side effects in men with prostate cancer. METHODS: For this cost-utility analysis, we used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to estimate and compare patient survival, costs from a health payer''s perspective, and cost-effectiveness of 3 treatment modalities for advanced prostate cancer patients, including radiation therapy, radiation plus ADT, and active surveillance. We also estimated quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by assigning appropriate health state utility values obtained from the literature for each phase of care and for long-term side effects. Propensity score matching was used to control for bias and confounding that were inherent to the observational study design. RESULTS: Adding ADT to radiation therapy increased median patient survival by 0.71 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for radiation plus ADT versus radiation alone was $63,049 and $295,995 per mean life-year gained for radiation compared with active surveillance, respectively. Treatment-associated adverse side effects substantially reduced QALYs gained. Compared with radiation only, the incremental cost of radiation plus ADT was $127,900 per mean QALY and was nearly 80% cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $210,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Despite ADT-associated costs and long-term side effects, compared with radiation alone, radiation plus ADT was cost-effective at $127,900 per QALY.

21404,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Cytoreductive Surgery and HIPEC Compared With Systemic Chemotherapy in Isolated Peritoneal Carcinomatosis From Metastatic Colorectal Cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness evaluations of cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) from metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in the United States are lacking. METHODS: The authors developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CRS/HIPEC compared with systemic chemotherapy for isolated PC from mCRC from a societal perspective in the United States. The systemic treatment regimens consisted of FOLFOX, FOLFIRI, bevacizumab, cetuximab, and pantitumumab. The model inputs including costs, probabilities, survival, progression, and utilities were taken from the literature. The cycle length for the model was 2 weeks, and the time horizon was 7 years. A discount rate of 3% was applied. The model was tested for internal and external validation, and robustness was established with univariate sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). The primary outcomes were total costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), life-years (LYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000 per QALY was assumed. RESULTS: The ICER for treatment with CRS/HIPEC compared with systemic chemotherapy was $91,034 per QALY gained ($74,098 per LY gained). The univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the total costs for treatment with CRS/HIPEC had the largest effect on the calculated ICER. The CRS/HIPEC treatment was a cost-effective strategy during the majority of simulations in the PSA. The average ICER for 100,000 simulations in the PSA was $70,807 per QALY gained. The likelihood of CRS/HIPEC being a cost-effective strategy at the WTP threshold was 87%.

21405,Cost-Effectiveness of Universal Hepatitis C Virus Screening of Pregnant Women in The United States,"Background: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) chronic prevalence among pregnant women in the United States (U.S.) U.S. doubled nationally from 2009-2014 (~0.7%), yet many remain undiagnosed. Screening pregnant women is not recommended by the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, despite new AASLD/IDSA guidelines recommending screening this group. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of HCV screening for pregnant women in the U.S. Methods: An HCV natural history Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of universal HCV screening of pregnant women followed by treatment after pregnancy compared to background risk-based screening from a health care payer perspective. We assumed 0.73% HCV chronic prevalence among pregnant women based on national data. We assume no Medicaid reimbursement restrictions by fibrosis stage at baseline, but explore differing restrictions in sensitivity analyses. We assessed cost (in USD$) and health outcomes (in quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) over a lifetime horizon, using new HCV drug costs of $25,000/treatment. We assess mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) under a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained. We additionally evaluate potential population impact. Results: Universal antenatal screening was cost-effective in all treatment eligibility scenarios (mean ICER <$3,000/QALY gained). Screening remained cost-effective at 0.07% prevalence, the lowest estimated prevalence state in the U.S. (Hawaii). Screening the ~5.04 million pregnant women in 2018 could result in detection and treatment of 33,000 women based on current fibrosis restrictions. Conclusions: Universal screening for HCV among pregnant women in the U.S. is cost effective and should be recommended nationally.",2019-01-30543,30689769,Clin Infect Dis,Antoine Chaillon,2019,/,,No,30689769,"Antoine Chaillon; Elizabeth B Rand; Nancy Reau; Natasha K Martin; Cost-Effectiveness of Universal Hepatitis C Virus Screening of Pregnant Women in The United States, Clin Infect Dis, 2019 Jun 18; ():1537-6591",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,universal antenatal screening and treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- Background screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,2826,United States,2018,2912.7
21406,The cost-effectiveness of canakinumab for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: The Australian healthcare perspective,"BACKGROUND: Canakinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-1beta. It is currently indicated for use in those with rheumatologic disorders due to its anti-inflammatory properties, and was recently shown to be beneficial for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the cost-effectiveness of canakinumab used to treat CVD is unknown. METHODS: A Markov state transition model was developed and populated with a hypothetical sample of 1000 individuals profiled on the Canakinumab Antiinflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS); with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and blood concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) of >2mg/L. With each annual cycle, individuals could have a recurrent non-fatal CVD event (MI or stroke), or die from a CVD event or die from other causes based on data from CANTOS. Individuals continued to cycle through the model for 20years or until death. Cost and utility data was applied. Outcomes were discounted (5% annually). RESULTS: Over a 20-year time horizon, canakinumab is predicted to prevent 40 recurrent cardiovascular events and save 287 (discounted) years of life and 239 (discounted) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in 1000 individuals. At an annual cost of AUD36,049 (USD25,590, GBP19,662) per person, canakinumab would not be considered cost-effective within the Australian healthcare system, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of AUD1,221,170 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Canakinumab is an attractive treatment option to reduce recurrent CVD among patients with high hsCRP. It would be considered cost-effective in this treatment setting within the perspective of the Australian public healthcare system if its annual costs do not exceed AUD1500 (USD1065, GBP818) per person.",2019-01-30547,30686493,Int J Cardiol,Ella Zomer,2019,285 /,1-5,No,30686493,"Ella Zomer; Danny Liew; Andrew Tonkin; James M Trauer; Zanfina Ademi; The cost-effectiveness of canakinumab for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: The Australian healthcare perspective, Int J Cardiol, 2019 Jun 15; 285():0167-5273; 1-5",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,canakinumab vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,5.00,5.00,235279.7,Australia,2018,181259.1
21407,Cost-effectiveness of Teriflunomide Compared to Interferon Beta-1b for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis Patients in China,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Teriflunomide is a once-daily oral immunomodulatory agent approved in 80 countries for the treatment of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS). The study objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of teriflunomide (14 mg tablet, daily) versus interferon beta-1b (250 mcg subcutaneous injection, every other day) among RMS patients from the Chinese healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A Markov model with annual cycles and a lifetime horizon was utilized to assess cost-effectiveness of teriflunomide in comparison with interferon beta-1b in RMS patients. Treatment effects, including 3-month confirmed disability worsening and annualized relapse rate, were derived from a network meta-analysis. Cost inputs included costs related to treatment acquisition, administration, monitoring, natural disease management through Expanded Disability Status Scale states, relapse treatment, and adverse event management. These costs were calculated as the product between unit costs from published sources and healthcare resource utilization patterns identified in a survey conducted among 11 neurologists across different areas in China. Health effects were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with costs in local currency ( yen) and US dollars (US$), 2018. RESULTS: Teriflunomide dominated interferon beta-1b and was associated with lower total costs (teriflunomide yen1,887,144 vs interferon beta-1b yen2,061,393) and higher QALYs (teriflunomide 9.60 QALYs vs interferon beta-1b 8.88 QALYs). In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, teriflunomide was dominant in 62.2% of model runs. CONCLUSION: Teriflunomide is a cost-effective therapy over a lifetime time horizon compared to interferon beta-1b in the treatment of RMS patients in China.

21410,Cost-effectiveness of influenza vaccine strategies for the elderly in South Korea,"OBJECTIVES: Despite a high vaccine uptake rate of over 80% in South Korea, the disease burden of influenza is still high among the elderly, which may be due to low effectiveness of vaccines. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of use among the elderly was analyzed in order to compare the current trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) with a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (QIV) or MF59-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (ATIV). METHODS: A static lifetime Markov model was used. It was assumed that the model would be repeated until individuals reached the age of 100. Cost-effectiveness was analyzed across three age groups (65-74 years, 75-84 years, and >/=85 years), and the at-risk group was studied. RESULTS: Compared to the TIV, the QIV was expected to reduce the number of influenza infections by 342,873, complications by 17,011, hospitalizations by 8,568, and deaths by 2,031. The QIV was highly cost-effective when compared to the TIV, with a base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimated at USD 17,699/QALY (1USD = 1,151KRW), and the ICER decreased with age and was USD 3,431/QALY in the group aged 85 and above. Sensitivity analysis revealed that the ICER was sensitive to the QIV price, the proportion of influenza B, and vaccine mismatching. On the other hand, the ATIV was expected to reduce the number of influenza cases and complications by 1,812,395 and 89,747, respectively, annually, yielding cost-saving among all ages. ATIV price and vaccine efficacy were the most influential parameters for the ICER of ATIV.

21412,Cost Effectiveness of Avelumab for Metastatic Merkel Cell Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: Metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) is a rare and aggressive skin cancer. Until recently, there were no licensed treatment options for patients with mMCC, and prognosis was poor. A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted for avelumab, a newly available treatment option for mMCC, versus standard care (SC), from a UK National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was developed to assess the lifetime costs and effects of avelumab versus SC. Data from the JAVELIN Merkel 200 trial (NCT02155647) were used to inform estimates of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Unit costs and associated frequencies of use were informed by published literature and clinical expert opinion. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs, i.e. the cost per QALY gained) for treatment-experienced (TE) and treatment-naive (TN) patients.

Patients and methods: The analysis was performed using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) in two different patient cohorts: one with suboptimal glycemic control at baseline (mean age 27 years, mean baseline HbA1c 8.0% [64 mmol/mol]) and the other at increased risk of hypoglycemic events (mean age 18.6 years, mean baseline HbA1c 7.5% [58 mmol/mol]). Clinical input data were sourced from published literature, and the analysis was performed from the societal perspective. Results: In patients with suboptimal baseline glycemic control, SAP improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.77 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) vs CSII (15.54 QALYs vs 13.77 QALYs) with higher lifetime costs (EUR 189,855 vs EUR 150,366), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EUR 22,325 per QALY gained. In this cohort, sensitivity analyses showed that the influence of SAP on fear of hypoglycemia (FoH) and baseline HbA1c were key drivers of results.

21420,Cost-effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy for adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome,"OBJECTIVE: To assess whether exposure-based internet-delivered cognitive-behavioural therapy (internet-CBT) is a cost-effective treatment for adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) compared with a waitlist control, from a societal perspective, based on data from a randomised trial. DESIGN: Within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Participants were recruited from the whole of Sweden via primary, secondary and tertiary care clinics reached through news media and advertising. PARTICIPANTS: Adolescents (aged 13-17) with a diagnosis of IBS. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to either an exposure-based internet-CBT, including 10 weekly modules for adolescents and five modules for parents, or a waitlist. OUTCOME MEASURES: The main health outcome was the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimated by mapping Pediatric Quality-of-Life Inventory (PedsQL) scores onto EQ-5D-3L utilities. The secondary outcome was the point improvement on the PedsQL scale. Data on health outcomes and resource use were collected at baseline and 10 weeks post-treatment. Resource use was measured using the Trimbos and Institute of Medical Technology Assessment Cost Questionnaire for Psychiatry (TIC-P) . Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated as the difference in average costs by the difference in average outcomes between groups. RESULTS: The base-case results showed that internet-CBT costs were on average US$170.24 (95% CI 63.14 to 315.04) more per participant than the waitlist. Adolescents in the internet-CBT group showed small QALY gains (0.0031; 95% CI 0.0003 to 0.0061), and an average improvement of 5.647 points (95% CI 1.82 to 9.46) on the PedsQL compared with the waitlist. Internet-CBT yielded an ICER of $54 916/QALY gained and a probability of cost-effectiveness of 74% given the Swedish willingness-to-pay threshold. The ICER for the outcome PedsQL was US$85.29/point improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Offering internet-CBT to adolescents with IBS improves health-related quality of life and generates small QALY gains at a higher cost than a waitlist control. Internet-CBT is thus likely to be cost-effective given the strong efficacy evidence, small QALY gains and low cost.

21421,Incremental cost-effectiveness of evidence-based non-surgical weight loss strategies,"Recent medical advancements have led to new modes of treatment for non-surgical weight loss, including several new medications. Our aim was to conduct an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis for all commercially available, evidence-based non-surgical weight loss interventions for people with excess weight. We identified interventions through a systematic review of randomized controlled trials that reported weight loss 12 months from baseline. We then meta-analysed the results, sourced costs and performed an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis from the payer perspective. Cost-effectiveness was presented in terms of cost per kilogram lost and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. We further performed sensitivity analyses on costs and duration of benefits, and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Ten interventions were identified for inclusion: six pharmaceutical products (Alli, Xenical, Qsymia, Contrave, Belviq and Saxenda), two lifestyle modification programmes (Weight Watchers Meetings and Online), one food replacement and lifestyle programme (Jenny Craig) and one intragastric balloon system (Orbera). At an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $30 071 per additional QALY gained, only Weight Watchers Meetings was cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses revealed that for the medications to become incrementally cost-effective, costs would have to decrease by as much as 91%.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a National Health Service (NHS)/health-provider perspective, utilizing a dynamic transmission model of HCV infection and disease progression, calibrated using city-specific surveillance and survey data, and primary data collection on NSP costs. The effectiveness of NSPs preventing HCV acquisition was based on empirical evidence. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: UK settings with different chronic HCV prevalence among people who inject drugs (PWID): Dundee (26%), Walsall (18%) and Bristol (45%) INTERVENTIONS: Current NSP provision is compared with a counterfactual scenario where NSPs are removed for 10 years and then returned to existing levels with effects collected for 40 years. MEASUREMENTS: HCV infections and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained through NSPs over 50 years. FINDINGS: Compared with a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20 000 per QALY gained, NSPs were highly cost-effective over a time-horizon of 50 years and decreased the number of HCV incident infections. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was cost-saving in Dundee and Bristol, and pound596 per QALY gained in Walsall, with 78, 46 and 40% of simulations being cost-saving in each city, respectively, with differences driven by coverage of NSP and HCV prevalence (lowest in Walsall). More than 90% of simulations were cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold. Results were robust to sensitivity analyses, including varying the time-horizon, HCV treatment cost and numbers of HCV treatments per year.

Medical experts have not agreed on the best solution of population intervention for this problem. We presented a health economic evaluation of a population-based H pylori screen-and-treat strategy for preventing gastric cancer, peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Decision trees and Markov models were developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of H pylori screening followed by eradication treatment in asymptomatic Chinese. The modeled screen-and-treat strategy reduced the risk of gastric cancer, PUD, and NUD. The main outcomes were the costs, effectiveness, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

21437,Cost Effectiveness of Inhaled Mannitol (Bronchitol((R))) in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis,"BACKGROUND: Inhaled mannitol (Bronchitol((R))) is licensed in Australia as a safe and efficacious addition to best supportive care in patients with cystic fibrosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of inhaled mannitol (in addition to best supportive care) in the Australian setting from the perspective of a government-funded national healthcare system. METHODS: A probabilistic patient-level simulation Markov model estimated life-time costs and outcomes of mannitol when added to best supportive care, compared with best supportive care alone in patients aged 6 years and older. We estimated treatment-related inputs (initial change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume, relative reduction in severe pulmonary exacerbations, and treatment discontinuations) from two phase III trials. Longer term natural history rates of predicted forced expiratory volume decline over time and severe pulmonary exacerbation rates for best supportive care were taken from Australian CF registries. The utility value for the cystic fibrosis health state was as measured in the trials using the Health Utility Index, whereas the impact of pulmonary exacerbations and lung transplantation on utility was ascertained from the published literature. The underlying cost of managing cystic fibrosis, and the cost associated with pulmonary exacerbations and transplantations was taken from published Australian sources. RESULTS: The addition of inhaled mannitol to best supportive care resulted in a discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year of AU$39,165. The result was robust with 77% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis samples below a willingness-to-pay threshold of AU$45,000/quality-adjusted life-year.

21438,Cost Effectiveness of Inhaled Mannitol (Bronchitol((R))) in Patients with Cystic Fibrosis,"BACKGROUND: Inhaled mannitol (Bronchitol((R))) is licensed in Australia as a safe and efficacious addition to best supportive care in patients with cystic fibrosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of inhaled mannitol (in addition to best supportive care) in the Australian setting from the perspective of a government-funded national healthcare system. METHODS: A probabilistic patient-level simulation Markov model estimated life-time costs and outcomes of mannitol when added to best supportive care, compared with best supportive care alone in patients aged 6 years and older. We estimated treatment-related inputs (initial change in percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume, relative reduction in severe pulmonary exacerbations, and treatment discontinuations) from two phase III trials.

21439,Health Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness From Promoting Smartphone Apps for Weight Loss: Multistate Life Table Modeling,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is an important risk factor for many chronic diseases. Mobile health interventions such as smartphone apps can potentially provide a convenient low-cost addition to other obesity reduction strategies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to estimate the impacts on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and health system costs over the remainder of the life span of the New Zealand population (N=4.4 million) for a smartphone app promotion intervention in 1 calendar year (2011) using currently available apps for weight loss. METHODS: The intervention was a national mass media promotion of selected smartphone apps for weight loss compared with no dedicated promotion. A multistate life table model including 14 body mass index-related diseases was used to estimate QALYs gained and health systems costs. A lifetime horizon, 3% discount rate, and health system perspective were used. The proportion of the target population receiving the intervention (1.36%) was calculated using the best evidence for the proportion who have access to smartphones, are likely to see the mass media campaign promoting the app, are likely to download a weight loss app, and are likely to continue using this app. RESULTS: In the base-case model, the smartphone app promotion intervention generated 29 QALYs (95% uncertainty interval, UI: 14-52) and cost the health system US $1.6 million (95% UI: 1.1-2.0 million) with the standard download rate. Under plausible assumptions, QALYs increased to 59 (95% UI: 27-107) and costs decreased to US $1.2 million (95% UI: 0.5-1.8) when standard download rates were doubled. Costs per QALY gained were US $53,600 for the standard download rate and US $20,100 when download rates were doubled. On the basis of a threshold of US $30,000 per QALY, this intervention was cost-effective for Maori when the standard download rates were increased by 50% and also for the total population when download rates were doubled. CONCLUSIONS: In this modeling study, the mass media promotion of a smartphone app for weight loss produced relatively small health gains on a population level and was of borderline cost-effectiveness for the total population.

On the basis of a threshold of US $30,000 per QALY, this intervention was cost-effective for Maori when the standard download rates were increased by 50% and also for the total population when download rates were doubled. CONCLUSIONS: In this modeling study, the mass media promotion of a smartphone app for weight loss produced relatively small health gains on a population level and was of borderline cost-effectiveness for the total population. Nevertheless, the scope for this type of intervention may expand with increasing smartphone use, more easy-to-use and effective apps becoming available, and with recommendations to use such apps being integrated into dietary counseling by health workers.",2019-01-30605,30664471,JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,Christine Cleghorn,2019,7 / 1,e11118,No,30664471,"Christine Cleghorn; Nick Wilson; Nisha Nair; Giorgi Kvizhinadze; Nhung Nghiem; Melissa McLeod; Tony Blakely; Health Benefits and Cost-Effectiveness From Promoting Smartphone Apps for Weight Loss: Multistate Life Table Modeling, JMIR Mhealth Uhealth, 2019 Jan 15; 7(1):2291-5222; e11118",QALY,New Zealand,Not Stated,Health Education or Behavior,National mass media promotion of smartphone apps for weight loss vs. None,Access to a smartphone,Not Stated,25 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,80000,New Zealand,2011,116430.79
21448,Estimating the health benefits and cost-savings of a cap on the size of single serve sugar-sweetened beverages,"Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake is associated with tooth decay, obesity and diabetes. We aimed to model the health and cost impact of reducing the serving size of all single serve SSB to a maximum of 250ml in New Zealand. A 250ml serving size cap was modeled for all instances of single serves (<600ml) of sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drinks, fruit drinks, carbonated energy drinks, and sports drinks in the New Zealand National Nutrition Survey intake data (2008/09). A multi-state life-table model used the change in energy intake and therefore BMI to predict the resulting health gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and health system costs over the remaining life course of the New Zealand population alive in 2011 (N=4.4 million, 3% discounting). The ''base case'' model (no compensation for reduced energy intake) resulted in an average reduction in SSB and energy intake of 23ml and 44kJ (11kcal) per day or 0.22kg of weight modeled over two years. The total health gain and cost-savings were 82,100 QALYs (95% UI: 65100 to 101,000) and NZ$1.65 billion [b] (95% UI: 1.19 b to 2.24 b, (US$1.10 b)) over the lifespan of the cohort.

21449,Incorporating Tumor Characteristics to Maximize 21-Gene Assay Utility: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Background: Literature suggests that Oncotype DX (ODX) is cost-effective. These studies, however, tend to ignore clinical characteristics and have not incorporated population-based data regarding the distribution of ODX results across different clinical risk groups. Accordingly, this study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ODX across strata of clinical risk groups using population-based ODX data. Methods: We created state-transition models to calculate costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained over the lifetime for women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative breast cancer from a US payer perspective. Using the Connecticut Tumor Registry, we classified the 2,245 patients diagnosed in 2011 through 2013 into 3 clinical risk groups according to the PREDICT model, a risk calculator developed by the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. Within each risk group, we then determined the recurrence score (RS) distributions (<18, 18-30, and >/=31). Other input parameters were derived from the literature. Uncertainty was assessed using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Approximately 82.5%, 11.9%, and 5.6% of our sample were in the PREDICT low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups, respectively. When combining these 3 groups, ODX had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $62,200 per QALY for patients aged 60 years. The ICERs, however, differed across clinical risk groups, ranging from $124,600 per QALY in the low-risk group, to $28,700 per QALY in the intermediate-risk group, to $15,700 per QALY in the high-risk group. Results were sensitive to patient age: the ICER for patients aged 45 to 75 years ranged from $77,100 to $344,600 per QALY in the PREDICT low-risk group, and was lower than $100,000 per QALY in the intermediate- and high-risk groups.

21461,Economic evaluation of stepped care for the management of childhood anxiety disorders: Results from a randomised trial,"BACKGROUND: Stepped care has been promoted for the management of mental disorders; however, there is no empirical evidence to support the cost-effectiveness of this approach for the treatment of anxiety disorders in youth. METHOD: This economic evaluation was conducted within a randomised controlled trial comparing stepped care to a validated, manualised treatment in 281 young people, aged 7-17, with a diagnosed anxiety disorder. Intervention costs were determined from therapist records. Administrative data on medication and medical service use were used to determine additional health care costs during the study period. Parents also completed a resource use questionnaire to collect medications, services not captured in administrative data and parental lost productivity. Outcomes included participant-completed quality of life, Child Health Utility - nine-dimension and parent-completed Assessment of Quality of Life - eight-dimension to calculate quality-adjusted life years. Mean costs and quality-adjusted life years were compared between groups at 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: Intervention delivery costs were significantly less for stepped care from the societal perspective (mean difference -$198, 95% confidence interval -$353 to -$19). Total combined costs were less for stepped care from both societal (-$1334, 95% confidence interval -$2386 to $510) and health sector (-$563, 95% confidence interval -$1353 to $643) perspectives but did not differ significantly from the manualised treatment. Youth and parental quality-adjusted life years were not significantly different between groups. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were robust. CONCLUSION: For youth with anxiety, this three-step model provided comparable outcomes and total health sector costs to a validated face-to-face programme. However, it was less costly to deliver from a societal perspective, making it an attractive option for some parents.

21462,Cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy and pembrolizumab monotherapy in the first-line treatment of squamous non-small-cell lung cancer in the US,"Objective: To describe the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel; P + C) in metastatic, squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the US. Methods: A model comparing P + C versus C alone is developed utilizing partitioned survival analysis. Primary clinical efficacy, treatment utilization, health utility and safety data are derived from the KEYNOTE-407 trial and projected over 20 years. Costs for drugs and non-drug disease management are also incorporated. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness of P + C vs. pembrolizumab monotherapy (P) is evaluated via an indirect treatment comparison, for patient subgroups with PD-L1 Tumor Proportion Score (TPS) >/= 50% and 1-49%. Results: Overall, P + C is projected to increase life expectancy by 1.95 years vs. C (3.86 versus 1.91). The resultant ICER is $86,293/QALY. In patients with PD-L1 >/= 50%, 1-49% and <1 the corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) are $99,777/QALY, $85,986/QALY and $87,507/QALY, respectively. Versus P, in the PD-L1 >/= 50% subgroup, P + C appears cost saving; however, this result should be interpreted with caution as there is considerable uncertainty in the relative efficacy of these comparators. Conclusions: Across all eligible patients, the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy is projected to approximately double life expectancy, yielding an extension to a point not previously seen in metastatic squamous NSCLC. Overall, and within all relevant PD-L1 subgroups, use of P + C yields an ICER below $100,000/QALY, and can be a cost-effective first-line treatment for eligible metastatic squamous NSCLC patients for whom chemotherapy is currently administered.

21463,Cost-effectiveness of Canakinumab for Prevention of Recurrent Cardiovascular Events,"Importance: In the Canakinumab Anti-inflammatory Thrombosis Outcome Study (CANTOS) trial, the anti-inflammatory monoclonal antibody canakinumab significantly reduced the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels of 2 mg/L or greater. Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding canakinumab to standard of care for the secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events over a range of potential prices. Design, Setting, and Participants: A state-transition Markov model was constructed to estimate costs and outcomes over a lifetime horizon by projecting rates of recurrent MI, coronary revascularization, infection, and lung cancer with and without canakinumab treatment. We used a US health care sector perspective, and the base case used the current US market price of canakinumab of $73000 per year. A hypothetical cohort of patients after MI aged 61 years with an hs-CRP level of 2 mg/L or greater was constructed. Interventions: Canakinumab, 150 mg, administered every 3 months plus standard of care compared with standard of care alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), discounted at 3% annually. Results: Adding canakinumab to standard of care increased life expectancy from 11.31 to 11.36 years, QALYs from 9.37 to 9.50, and costs from $242000 to $1074000, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6.4 million per QALY gained. The price would have to be reduced by more than 98% (to $1150 per year or less) to meet the $100000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold. These results were generally robust across alternative assumptions, eg, substantially lower health-related quality of life after recurrent cardiovascular events, lower infection rates while receiving canakinumab, and reduced all-cause mortality while receiving canakinumab. Including a potential beneficial effect of canakinumab on lung cancer incidence improved the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to $3.5 million per QALY gained. A strategy of continuing canakinumab selectively in patients with reduction in hs-CRP levels to less than 2 mg/L would have a cost-effectiveness ratio of $819000 per QALY gained. Conclusions and Relevance: Canakinumab is not cost-effective at current US prices for prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events in patients with a prior MI. Substantial price reductions would be needed for canakinumab to be considered cost-effective.",2019-01-30649,30649147,JAMA Cardiol,Thomas S G Sehested,2019,4 / 2,128-135,No,30649147,"Thomas S G Sehested; Jenny Bjerre; Seul Ku; Andrew Chang; Alison Jahansouz; Douglas K Owens; Mark A Hlatky; Jeremy D Goldhaber-Fiebert; Cost-effectiveness of Canakinumab for Prevention of Recurrent Cardiovascular Events, JAMA Cardiol, 2019 Feb 1; 4(2):2380-6591; 128-135",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Canakinumab + standard of care vs. Standard/Usual Care,previous myocardial infarction; elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein of 2mg/L or greater,61 Years,61 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,6400000,United States,2018,6596352.95
21464,An economic model of the cost-utility of pre-emptive genetic testing to support pharmacotherapy in patients with major depression in primary care,"The pharmacokinetics of many antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI)) are influenced by the highly polymorphic CYP2D6 enzyme. Therefore, pharmacogenetics could play an important role in the treatment of depressive patients. The potential cost-utility of screening patients is however still unknown. Therefore, a Markov model was developed to compare the strategy of screening for CYP2D6 and subsequently adjust antidepressant treatment according to a patient''s metabolizer profile of poor, extensive, or ultra metabolizer, with the strategy of no screening (''one size fits all'' principle). Each week a patient had a probability of side effects, which was followed by dosage titration or treatment switching. After 6 weeks treatment effect was evaluated followed by treatment adjustments if necessary, with a total time horizon of the model of 12 weeks. The analysis was performed from a societal perspective. The strategy of screening compared with no screening resulted in incremental costs of euro91 (95 percentiles: euro39; euro152) more expensive but also more effect with 0.001 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) (95 percentiles: 0.001; 0.002) gain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was therefore euro77,406 per QALY gained, but varied between euro22,500 and euro377,500 depending on the price of screening and productivity losses. According to our model, we cannot unequivocally conclude that screening for CYP2D6 in primary care patients using antidepressants is be cost-effective, as the results are surrounded by large uncertainty.

21465,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmacogenomics-guided clopidogrel treatment in Spanish patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention,"Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug given to patients before and after having a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Genomic variants in the CYP2C19 gene are associated with variable enzyme activities affecting drug metabolism and hence, patients with reduced or increased enzymatic function have increased risk of bleeding. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare a pharmacogenomics versus a non-pharmacogenomics-guided clopidogrel treatment for coronary artery syndrome patients undergoing PCI in the Spanish healthcare setting. A total of 549 patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease followed by PCI were recruited. Dual antiplatelet therapy was administrated to all patients from 1 to 12 months after PCI. Patients were classified into two groups: the Retrospective group was treated with clopidogrel based on the clinical routine practice and the Prospective group were initially genotyped for the presence of CYP2C19 variant alleles before treatment with those carrying more than one CYP2C19 variant alleles given prasugrel treatment. We collected data on established clinical and health outcome measures, including, per treatment arm: the percentage of patients that suffered from (a) myocardial infraction, (b) major bleeding and minor bleeding, (c) stroke, (d) the number of hospitalization days, and (e) the number of days patients spent in Intensive Care Unit. Our primary outcome measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis was Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). To estimate the treatment cost for each patient, individual data on its resource used were combined with unit price data, obtained from Spanish national sources. The analysis predicts a survival of 0.9446 QALYs in the pharmacogenomics arm and 0.9379 QALYs in the non-pharmacogenomics arm within a 1-year horizon. The cumulative costs per patient were euro2971 and euro3205 for the Prospective and Retrospective groups, respectively. The main cost driver of total cost in both arms was hospitalization costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was negative indicating that the PGx was a dominant option.

21466,Cost-effectiveness analysis of mechanical thrombectomy plus tissue-type plasminogen activator compared with tissue-type plasminogen activator alone for acute ischemic stroke in France,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies demonstrated the benefit of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) plus intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (IV-tPA) (MT-IV-tPA) in acute ischemic stroke. This study aimed to estimate the cost-utility of MT-IV-tPA compared with IV-tPA alone from the perspective of the French National Health Insurance. METHODS: We developed a decision tree for the first 3 months after stroke onset and a Markov model until 10 years post-stroke. The health states of the Markov model were according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS): independent (mRS=0-2), dependent (mRS=3-5), dead (mRS=6). Recurrent stroke was the fourth health stage of our model. We conducted systematic literature reviews and meta-analyses to estimate the cost and utility of each health state, and the transition probabilities between health states. A microcosting study was conducted to estimate the cost of MT. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of MT-IV-tPA and conducted a probabilistic analysis in order to estimate the probability that MT-IV-tPA is cost-effective compared to IV-tPA, the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), and the expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI), given the uncertainty surrounding the value of our model''s parameters. RESULTS: The total mean (standard deviation (SD) cost of MT was euro6708.9 (2357.0). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the strategy using IV-tPA combined to MT costs was euro14,715 per QALY gained as compared to a strategy using IV-tPA alone. The probabilistic analysis showed that the probability of MT-IV-TPA being cost-effective was 85.4% at threshold willingness-to-pay of euro30,000 per QALY gained, reaching 98% at euro50,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Although there is no universally accepted willingness-to-pay threshold in France, our analysis suggest that MT combined to IV-tPA can be considered a cost-effective treatment compared with IV-tPA alone.",2019-01-30661,30642680,Rev Neurol (Paris),N Kabore,2019,175 / 4,252-260,No,30642680,"N Kabore; G Marnat; F Rouanet; X Barreau; E Verpillot; P Menegon; I Maachi; J Berge; I Sibon; A Benard; Cost-effectiveness analysis of mechanical thrombectomy plus tissue-type plasminogen activator compared with tissue-type plasminogen activator alone for acute ischemic stroke in France, Rev Neurol (Paris), 2019 Apr; 175(4):0035-3787; 252-260",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",mechanical thrombectomy + intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator vs. Intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator,"related to a large intracranial artery occlusion, eligible for mechanical thrombectomy",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,4.00,4.00,14715,Euro,2015,17831.19
21467,Cost-effectiveness of Osimertinib as First-line Treatment and Sequential Therapy for EGFR Mutation-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in China,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib with gefitinib or erlotinib as first-line and sequential therapy for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China. METHODS: The Markov model was used, and the study included 3 health states over a 10-year period. Transition probabilities and safety data were collected from the FLAURA (AZD9291 versus gefitinib or erlotinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer) trial. Cost and utility values were derived from local charges and literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to observe model stability. FINDINGS: The strategy with gefitinib or erlotinib first-line therapy and second-line gene-guided osimertinib therapy (GE-T790M) resulted in a gain of 0.31 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) at a cost of $15,200.95 per patient compared with the gefitinib or erlotinib first-line therapy and second-line chemotherapy (GE-chemotherapy). The incremental QALY and incremental cost values for first-line osimertinib therapy compared with GE-chemotherapy was 0.96 and $69,420.76, respectively. Compared with the GE-T790M strategy (0.96 QALY and $29,223.33), first-line osimertinib was estimated to be more effective (1.61 QALYs) and more costly ($83,443.14). Relative to the GE-chemotherapy strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $47,873.96 and $71,954.08 per QALY gained with GE-T790M and the osimertinib first-line strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for first-line osimertinib versus GE-T790M was estimated to be $83,766.61.

21468,Cost-effectiveness of Osimertinib as First-line Treatment and Sequential Therapy for EGFR Mutation-positive Non-small Cell Lung Cancer in China,"PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib with gefitinib or erlotinib as first-line and sequential therapy for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China. METHODS: The Markov model was used, and the study included 3 health states over a 10-year period. Transition probabilities and safety data were collected from the FLAURA (AZD9291 versus gefitinib or erlotinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer) trial. Cost and utility values were derived from local charges and literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed to observe model stability. FINDINGS: The strategy with gefitinib or erlotinib first-line therapy and second-line gene-guided osimertinib therapy (GE-T790M) resulted in a gain of 0.31 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) at a cost of $15,200.95 per patient compared with the gefitinib or erlotinib first-line therapy and second-line chemotherapy (GE-chemotherapy). The incremental QALY and incremental cost values for first-line osimertinib therapy compared with GE-chemotherapy was 0.96 and $69,420.76, respectively. Compared with the GE-T790M strategy (0.96 QALY and $29,223.33), first-line osimertinib was estimated to be more effective (1.61 QALYs) and more costly ($83,443.14). Relative to the GE-chemotherapy strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $47,873.96 and $71,954.08 per QALY gained with GE-T790M and the osimertinib first-line strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for first-line osimertinib versus GE-T790M was estimated to be $83,766.61. The results were found to be robust for univariate and multivariable sensitivity analyses.

21469,Cost-utility analysis of adjuvant imatinib treatment in patients with high risk of recurrence after gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) resection in Thailand,"Background: Many patients develop tumour recurrence within a few years after undergoing surgical resection of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). Adjuvant imatinib treatment is recommended for patients with high risk of GIST recurrence as it can improve recurrence-free survival and overall survival of patients. This study aims to assess the cost-utility of adjuvant imatinib in patients with high risk of GIST recurrence after surgery compared with no adjuvant therapy in Thailand. Methods: A Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and outcomes of using adjuvant imatinib treatment and other treatment alternatives if recurrence occurred compared with the current situation of no adjuvant therapy in high-risk patients after surgery. A 1-month cycle length was deployed in the model. Transition probabilities were derived from literature review. Costs were collected and calculated for the year 2014 from a societal perspective. Future costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess parameter uncertainties. Results: Three years of adjuvant imatinib treatment followed by imatinib treatment and best supportive care if recurrence occurred after or during adjuvant therapy, respectively, was the best option as it produced more health outcomes (1.23 life years (LYs) and 1.16 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) compared to no adjuvant therapy while yielding the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 1,648,801 Thai Baht (THB) per QALY gained. Three years of adjuvant imatinib treatment followed by sunitinib treatment if recurrence occurred had an ICER of 2,608,264 THB per QALY gained compared to the best option, while other options were dominated. A one-way sensitivity analysis showed that the utility of patients receiving adjuvant imatinib had the greatest effect on the model, followed by the discount rate and probability of GIST recurrence.

One barrier to improved vaccine coverage is the complexity of the adult vaccination schedule. This exploratory analysis compared the cost-effectiveness of strategies to increase pneumococcal vaccine uptake in high-risk adults aged 50-64 years. We used a Markov model to compare strategies for non-immunocompromised 50-64 year olds: 1) current pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) recommendations; 2) current recommendations enhanced by an intervention; 3) PPSV23 plus pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) for high-risk patients with no intervention; or 4) both vaccines for all 50-year-olds with no intervention. Parameters included CDC data and other US data, varied extensively in sensitivity analyses. In the analysis, vaccinating high-risk individuals with PPSV23/PCV13 was the least costly strategy, with total costs of $424/person.

A societal perspective was adopted and a lifetime horizon was considered. Different sources of data and assumptions were used to calibrate PPSV23 and PCV13 effectiveness. Inpatient costs were based on the 2013 diagnosis-related group (DRG) database for National Health Service (NHS) hospitals and expert opinion; NHS official tariffs were the main source for unitary costs. PCV13 shows ICURs of euro17,746/QALY and euro13,146/QALY versus ""no vaccination"" and vaccination with PPSV23, respectively. Results proved to be robust in univariate sensitivity analyses, where all ratios were below a euro20,000 threshold, with the exception of the scenario with PCV13 effectiveness halved. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 94% of simulations showed cost-effectiveness ratios lower than euro20,000/QALY, in both strategies. It was found that PCV13 is a cost-effective strategy to prevent pneumococcal disease in adults in Portugal.",2019-01-30679,30633615,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Miguel Gouveia,2019,15 / 4,850-858,No,30633615,"Miguel Gouveia; Goncalo Jesus; Monica Ines; Joao Costa; Margarida Borges; Cost-effectiveness of the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in adults in Portugal versus ""no vaccination"" and versus vaccination with the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, Hum Vaccin Immunother , 2019; 15(4):2164-554X; 850-858",QALY,Portugal,Not Stated,Immunization,13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine vs. 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,11036.67,Euro,2013,16285.03
21479,Short-Term Effects and Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Universal Hepatitis C Testing in Prenatal Care,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the clinical effects and cost-effectiveness of universal prenatal hepatitis C screening, and to calculate potential life expectancy, quality of life, and health care costs associated with universal prenatal hepatitis C screening and linkage to treatment. METHODS: Using a stochastic individual-level microsimulation model, we simulated the lifetimes of 250 million pregnant women matched at baseline with the U.S. childbearing population on age, injection drug use behaviors, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection status. Modeled outcomes included hepatitis C diagnosis, treatment and cure, lifetime health care costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing universal prenatal hepatitis C screening to current practice. We modeled whether neonates exposed to maternal HCV at birth were identified as such. RESULTS: Pregnant women with hepatitis C infection lived 1.21 years longer and had 16% lower HCV-attributable mortality with universal prenatal hepatitis C screening, which had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $41,000 per QALY gained compared with current practice. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios remained below $100,000 per QALY gained in most sensitivity analyses; notable exceptions included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios above $100,000 when assuming mean time to cirrhosis of 70 years, a cost greater than $500,000 per false positive diagnosis, or population HCV infection prevalence below 0.16%. Universal prenatal hepatitis C screening increased identification of neonates exposed to HCV at birth from 44% to 92%. CONCLUSIONS: In our model, universal prenatal hepatitis C screening improves health outcomes in women with HCV infection, improves identification of HCV exposure in neonates born at risk, and is cost-effective.",2019-01-30681,30633134,Obstet Gynecol,Abriana Tasillo,2019,133 / 2,289-300,No,30633134,"Abriana Tasillo; Golnaz Eftekhari Yazdi; Shayla Nolen; Sarah Schillie; Claudia Vellozzi; Rachel Epstein; Liisa Randall; Joshua A Salomon; Benjamin P Linas; Short-Term Effects and Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Universal Hepatitis C Testing in Prenatal Care, Obstet Gynecol, 2019 Feb; 133(2):0029-7844; 289-300",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,Universal hepatitis C testing in prenatal care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Hepatitis C Screening,Pregnant,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,"Lifetime, 5 years",3.00,3.00,78000,United States,2017,82356.63
21480,Obinutuzumab plus chemotherapy followed by obinutuzumab monotherapy is cost-effective vs. rituximab plus chemotherapy followed by rituximab monotherapy for previously untreated follicular lymphoma patients in the United States,"The GALLIUM trial compared obinutuzumab (GA101, G)-based chemotherapy followed by G monotherapy (G + chemo) for up to two years to rituximab (R)-based chemotherapy followed by R monotherapy (R + chemo) for up to two years in previously untreated follicular lymphoma (FL) patients. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of G + chemo versus R + chemo utilizing GALLIUM trial data and published literature. G + chemo had increased drug costs (undiscounted: $135,200 versus $127,700 for R + chemo), representing a relative increase of 5.9%. However, this was offset by a $6,400 lower cost for disease progression. G + chemo led to increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to R + chemo of 0.81 (95% credible range, [CR]: 0.22-1.37), and the overall discounted incremental cost was $1,900 (95% CR: -$7,400 to $8,900). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was approximately $2,300 per QALY gained, and the results were highly robust to sensitivity analyses.

21481,Cost-effectiveness of combination disease-modifying antirheumatics vs. tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in active rheumatoid arthritis: TACIT trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether intensive combinations of synthetic disease modifying drugs (cDMARDS) achieve similar clinical benefits more cheaply than high-cost biologics such as tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have failed to respond to methotrexate and another DMARD. METHODS: Within-trial, cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses from health and social care (H&SC) and two societal perspectives. Participants were recruited into an open-label, 12-month, pragmatic, randomised, multicentre, two-arm, non-inferiority trial in 24 rheumatology clinics in England. Costs were linked with the Heath Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ; primary outcome) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from two measures (SF-36, EQ-5D-3L). RESULTS: 205 participants were recruited, 104 in the cDMARDs arm, 101 in the TNFis arm. cDMARD arm participants with poor response at 6 months were offered TNFis; 46 (44%) switched. Relevant cost and outcome data were available for 93% of participants at 6 month follow-up and 91-92% at 12 month follow-up. The cDMARDs arm had significantly lower total costs from all perspectives (6 month H&SC adjusted mean difference - pound3615 (95% confidence interval - pound4104 to - pound3182); 12 month H&SC adjusted mean difference - pound1930 (95% confidence interval - pound2599 to - pound1301)). The HAQ showed benefit to the cDMARDs arm at 12 months (-0.16; 95% CI-0.32 to -0.01); other outcomes/follow-ups showed no differences. CONCLUSION: Starting treatment with cDMARDs, rather than TNFis, achieves similar outcomes at significantly lower costs. Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and meeting NICE criteria for expensive biologics can cost-effectively be treated with combinations of intensive synthetic disease modifying drugs.

21482,Early treatment of acute hepatitis C infection is cost-effective in HIV-infected men-who-have-sex-with-men,"BACKGROUND: Treatment of hepatitis C virus infections (HCV) with direct acting antivirals (DAA) can prevent new infections since cured individuals cannot transmit HCV. However, as DAAs are expensive, many countries defer treatment to advances stages of fibrosis, which results in ongoing transmission. We assessed the epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of treatment initiation in different stages of infection in the Netherlands where the epidemic is mainly concentrated among HIV-infected MSMs. METHODS: We calibrated a deterministic mathematical model to the Dutch HCV epidemic among HIV-infected MSM to compare three different DAA treatment scenarios: 1) immediate treatment, 2) treatment delayed to chronic infection allowing spontaneous clearance to occur, 3) treatment delayed until F2 fibrosis stage. All scenarios are simulated from 2015 onwards. Total costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and epidemiological impact were calculated from a providers perspective over a lifetime horizon. We used a DAA price of euro35,000 and 3% discounting rates for cost and QALYs. RESULTS: Immediate DAA treatment lowers the incidence from 1.2/100 person-years to 0.2/100 person-years (interquartile range 0.1-0.2) and the prevalence from 5.0/100 person-years to 0.5/100 person-years (0.4-0.6) after 20 years. Delayed treatment awaiting spontaneous clearance will result in a similar reduction. However, further delayed treatment to F2 will increases the incidence and prevalence. Earlier treatment will cost society euro68.3 and euro75.1 million over a lifetime for immediate and awaiting until the chronic stage, respectively. The cost will increase if treatment is further delayed until F2 to euro98.4 million. Immediate treatment will prevent 7070 new infections and gains 3419 (3019-3854) QALYs compared to F2 treatment resulting in a cost saving ICER. Treatment in the chronic stage is however dominated.

21484,Cost-effectiveness of a therapeutic Tai Ji Quan fall prevention intervention for older adults at high risk of falling,"Background: Data on the cost-effectiveness of proven fall prevention exercise interventions are limited. We aimed to establish the cost-effectiveness of Tai Ji Quan: Moving for Better Balance (TJQMBB) compared to a conventional exercise intervention for older adults at high risk of falling. Methods: We conducted a trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis involving 670 older adults who had a history of falling or impaired mobility. Participants received one of three interventions-TJQMBB, Multimodal Exercise, or Stretching Exercise (control)-each of which was implemented twice weekly for 24 weeks. The primary cost-effectiveness measure was the incremental cost per additional fall prevented, comparing TJQMBB and Multimodal Exercise to Stretching and TJQMBB to Multimodal Exercise, with a secondary measure of incremental cost per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The intervention was conducted between February 2015 and January 2018, and cost-effectiveness was estimated from a health care system perspective over a 6-month time horizon. Results: The total cost to deliver the TJQMBB intervention was $202,949 (an average of $906 per participant); for Multimodal Exercise it was $223,849 ($1,004 per participant); and for Stretching it was $210,468 ($903 per participant). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios showed that the Multimodal Exercise was cost-effective ($850 per additional fall prevented; $27,614 per additional QALY gained) relative to Stretching; however, TJQMBB was the most economically dominant strategy (i.e., having lower cost and being clinically more efficacious) compared to Multimodal and Stretching exercises with regard to cost per additional fall prevented and per additional QALY gained. TJQMBB had a 100% probability of being cost-effective, relative to Stretching, at a threshold of $500 per each additional fall prevented and $10,000 per additional QALY gained.

21489,Cost-effectiveness of fluocinolone acetonide implant (ILUVIEN(R)) in UK patients with chronic diabetic macular oedema considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic macular oedema (DMO) may lead to visual loss and blindness. Several pharmacological treatments are available on the National Health Service (NHS) to United Kingdom patients affected by this condition, including intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGFs) and two types of intravitreal steroid implants, releasing dexamethasone or fluocinolone acetonide (FAc). This study aimed to assess the value for money (cost-effectiveness) of the FAc 0.2 mug/day implant (ILUVIEN(R)) in patients with chronic DMO considered insufficiently responsive to other therapies. METHODS: We developed a Markov model with a 15-year time horizon to estimate the impact of changes in best-corrected visual acuity in DMO patients on costs and quality-adjusted life years. The model considered both eyes, designated as the ""study eye"", defined at model entry as phakic with an ongoing cataract formation or pseudophakic, and the ""fellow eye"". The model compared the FAc 0.2 mug/day implant with a 700 mug dexamethasone implant (pseudophakic patients only) or with usual care, defined as a mixture of laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGFs (phakic and pseudophakic patients). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services; full NHS prices were used for drugs. RESULTS: In patients who were pseudophakic at baseline, at 36 months, the FAc implant provided an additional gain of 4.01 and 3.64 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters compared with usual care and the dexamethasone implant, respectively. Over the 15-year time horizon, this translated into 0.185 additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an extra cost of pound3066 compared with usual care, and 0.126 additional QALYs at an extra cost of pound1777 compared with dexamethasone.

Several pharmacological treatments are available on the National Health Service (NHS) to United Kingdom patients affected by this condition, including intravitreal vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors (anti-VEGFs) and two types of intravitreal steroid implants, releasing dexamethasone or fluocinolone acetonide (FAc). This study aimed to assess the value for money (cost-effectiveness) of the FAc 0.2 mug/day implant (ILUVIEN(R)) in patients with chronic DMO considered insufficiently responsive to other therapies. METHODS: We developed a Markov model with a 15-year time horizon to estimate the impact of changes in best-corrected visual acuity in DMO patients on costs and quality-adjusted life years. The model considered both eyes, designated as the ""study eye"", defined at model entry as phakic with an ongoing cataract formation or pseudophakic, and the ""fellow eye"". The model compared the FAc 0.2 mug/day implant with a 700 mug dexamethasone implant (pseudophakic patients only) or with usual care, defined as a mixture of laser photocoagulation and anti-VEGFs (phakic and pseudophakic patients). Costs were estimated from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services; full NHS prices were used for drugs. RESULTS: In patients who were pseudophakic at baseline, at 36 months, the FAc implant provided an additional gain of 4.01 and 3.64 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters compared with usual care and the dexamethasone implant, respectively.

21492,Cost-effectiveness of mini-laparotomy in patients with colorectal cancers: A propensity scoring matching approach,"OBJECTIVE: Surgical technique process innovations are expected to generally incur no additional cost but gain better quality. Whether a mini-laparotomy surgery (MLS) in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) is more cost effective than conventional open surgery had not been well examined. The objective of this study was to apply cost-effectiveness approaches to investigate the cost effectiveness of adopting MLS compared with open surgery 1 year following resection in CRC patients. RESEARCH DESIGN: A prospective non-randomized cohort study design. SETTING: An academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 224 patients who received elective MLS and 339 who received conventional surgery; after propensity score matching, 212 pairs were included for analysis. INTERVENTION: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost measures were hospital-index cost and outpatient and inpatient costs within 1 year after discharge. Effectiveness measures were life-years (LYs) gained and quality-adjusted life-year (QALYs) gained. STATISTICAL METHODS: We calculated incremental costs and effectiveness by differences in these values between MLS and conventional surgery using adjusted predicted estimates. RESULTS: MLS patients had lower rates of blood transfusions, less complication, and shorter post-surgical lengths of stay and more medical cost savings. One-year overall medical costs for MLS patients were TWD 748,269 (USD 24,942) per QALY gained, significant lower than for the comparison group (p-value = 0.045). CONCLUSION: Our findings supported that the less invasive surgical process through MLS not only saved medical costs, but also increased QALYs for surgical treatment in CRC patients.",2019-01-30699,30625209,PLoS One,Herng-Chia Chiu,2019,14 / 1,e0209970,No,30625209,"Herng-Chia Chiu; Hui-Min Hsieh; Chi-Lin Wan; Hsiang-Lin Tsai; Jaw-Yuan Wang; Cost-effectiveness of mini-laparotomy in patients with colorectal cancers: A propensity scoring matching approach, PLoS One , 2019; 14(1):1932-6203; e0209970",QALY,Taiwan,Not Stated,Surgical,Mini-laparotomy vs. Standard/Usual Care- conventional open surgery,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-725917.81,United States,2012,-818294.53
21493,Cost-effectiveness of an adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine in older adults in the United States who have been previously vaccinated with zoster vaccine live,"Zoster Vaccine Live (ZVL) is marketed in the US since 2008, and a non-live adjuvanted Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV) was approved in 2017. Literature suggests that waning of ZVL efficacy may necessitate additional vaccination. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended vaccination with RZV in immunocompetent adults aged 50+ years old, including those previously vaccinated with ZVL. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating US adults aged 60+ years old, previously vaccinated with ZVL. The ZOster ecoNomic Analysis (ZONA) model, a deterministic Markov model, was adapted to follow a hypothetical 1 million(M)-person cohort of US adults previously vaccinated with ZVL. Model inputs included demographics, epidemiology, vaccine characteristics, utilities and costs. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were presented over the lifetimes of the cohort from the year of additional vaccination, discounted 3% annually. The model estimated that, vaccination with RZV 5 years after previous vaccination with ZVL, would reduce disease burden compared with no additional vaccination, resulting in a gain of 1,633 QALYs at a total societal cost of $96M (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: $58,793/QALY saved). Compared with revaccinating with ZVL, vaccination with RZV would result in a gain of 1,187 QALYs and societal cost savings of almost $84M. Sensitivity, scenario, and threshold analyses demonstrated robustness of these findings.

21495,Cost-Effectiveness of Bridging Anticoagulation Among Patients with Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Bridging anticoagulation is commonly prescribed to patients with atrial fibrillation during initiation and interruption of warfarin. Guidelines recommend bridging patients at high risk of stroke, while a recent randomized trial demonstrated overall harm in a population at comparatively low risk of ischemic stroke. Theory suggests that patients at high risk of stroke and low risk of hemorrhage may benefit from bridging, but data informing patient selection are scant. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the utility and cost-effectiveness of bridging anticoagulation among patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, stratified by thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risk DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis with lifelong time horizon, from the perspective of a third-party payer MAIN MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per bridged patient; US dollars per QALY gained KEY RESULTS: Unselected patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation may be harmed by bridging anticoagulation. Hospital admission for bridging is almost never cost-effective, and generally harmful. Among patients carefully selected by both thromboembolic and hemorrhagic risks, outpatient bridging can be beneficial and cost-effective. Results were sensitive to how effectively heparin products reduce stroke risk. CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient bridging anticoagulation can be beneficial and cost-effective for a subset of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation during interruption or initiation of warfarin.

21496,Cost-effectiveness and quality of life of a diet intervention postpartum: 2-year results from a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Pregnancy has been identified as a contributor to obesity. We have shown that a diet intervention postpartum produced a 2-y weight loss of 8%. Here, we present the impact of the diet intervention on cost-effectiveness and explore changes in quality of life (QOL). METHODS: A total of 110 postpartum women with overweight/obesity were randomly assigned to diet (D-group) or control (C-group). D-group received a 12-wk diet intervention within primary health care followed by monthly emails up to the 1-y follow-up. C-group received a brochure. Changes in QOL were measured using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey and EQ-5D. The analysis of cost-effectiveness was a cost-utility analysis with a health care perspective and included costs of intervention for stakeholder, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and savings in health care. The likelihood of cost-effectiveness was examined using the net monetary benefit method. RESULTS: The D-group increased their QOL more than the C-group at 12 wk. and 1 y, with pronounced differences for the dimensions general health and mental health, and the mental component summary score (all p < 0.05). Cost per gained QALY was 1704-7889 USD. The likelihood for cost-effectiveness, based on a willingness to pay 50,000 USD per QALY, was 0.77-1.00. CONCLUSIONS: A diet intervention that produced clinically relevant postpartum weight loss also resulted in increased QOL and was cost-effective.

METHODS: We developed a partitioned-survival model (progression-free survival, post-progression survival, and death) to determine the clinical and economic outcomes of immunotherapy for advanced melanoma over a 20-year time horizon. Regimen was compared with nivolumab, ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab. Two treatment durations for pembrolizumab were considered: (1) maximum of 24 months or until progression or (2) no maximum duration, until progression. The model used data from CheckMate-067 (28 months'' follow-up) for treatments involving nivolumab and ipilimumab. The efficacy of pembrolizumab was estimated using indirect comparisons. A scenario looking at the cost of subsequent treatments following disease progression was examined. RESULTS: Regimen had better outcomes and was cost effective compared with all other immunotherapies at a threshold of $CAN100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Compared with nivolumab and ipilimumab, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were $CAN47,119 and 66,750 per QALY, respectively.
