6901,Economic evaluation of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of hypertension in Greece,"OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. This study evaluates irbesartan in relation to commonly used alternative hypertension therapies losartan and valsartan given in combination with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in the general hypertensive population in Greece. METHODS: A Markov model with eight states of health was constructed: hypertension, myocardial infarction (MI), post-MI, angina, stroke, poststroke, heart failure, and death. The model has an annual cycle and estimates mean quality-adjusted survival and treatment cost, which reflect the hypertension treatment and managing cardiovascular events. Risk functions were used to conduct extrapolations. Data on treatment effectiveness, quality of life (QOL) and epidemiology were obtained from published clinical trials and studies. The database of the main Greek National Social Insurance Institute (IKA) was analyzed to estimate the cost of events. The analysis was done from a payer perspective. All outcomes were discounted, and prices correspond to 2008. RESULTS: The estimated patient cost per annum was stable angina <euro>2,252, unstable angina <euro>2,572, myocardial infarction <euro>2,473, post-MI <euro>1,677, stroke <euro>12,233, poststroke <euro>1,240, heart failure <euro>2,655, coronary angiography <euro>1,544, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty <euro>6,511, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery <euro>11,514. For the baseline group (age 57 years, systolic blood pressure 147 mmHg, cholesterol 6.00 mmol/L, body mass index 29) of men with mild to moderate hypertension, for irbesartan, the total treatment cost was <euro>15,146, for losartan <euro>15,696 and for valsartan <euro>15,613; the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were irbesartan 12.67, losartan 12.63 and valsartan 12.64. For the baseline group of women with mild to moderate hypertension, the total treatment cost was <euro>12,945 for irbesartan, <euro>13,424 for losartan and <euro>13,379 for valsartan; QALYs were 14.29 for irbesartan, 14.27 for losartan and 14.27 for valsartan. For men with severe hypertension, for irbesartan and losartan, the total treatment cost was <euro>18,679 and <euro>21,488 and QALYs 12.47 and 12.37, respectively. For women, the total treatment cost was <euro>16,202 and <euro>19,099 and QALYs 14.16 and 14.09, respectively. Similar results were obtained in relation to other treatment groups in various sensitivity analysis scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Based on efficacy data from clinical trials and lower attainment costs in various hypertensive patient populations, irbesartan in combination with HCTZ compares favorably with losartan and valsartan in combination with HCTZ in the Greek setting.",2010-01-06359,20411401,Eur J Health Econ,Nikos Maniadakis,2010,/,,Yes,20411401,"Nikos Maniadakis; Economic evaluation of irbesartan in combination with hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of hypertension in Greece, Eur J Health Econ, 2010-Apr-22; ():1618-7598",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Irbesartan vs. Valsartan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-21700,Euro,2008,-38411.86
6902,Cost-effectiveness of a motivational intervention for alcohol-involved youth in a hospital emergency department,"OBJECTIVE: Brief interventions in the emergency department targeting risk-taking youth show promise to reduce alcohol-related injury. This study models the cost-effectiveness of a motivational interviewing-based intervention relative to brief advice to stop alcohol-related risk behaviors (standard care). Average cost-effectiveness ratios were compared between conditions. In addition, a cost-utility analysis examined the incremental cost of motivational interviewing per quality-adjusted life year gained. METHOD: Microcosting methods were used to estimate marginal costs of motivational interviewing and standard care as well as two methods of patient screening: standard emergency-department staff questioning and proactive outreach by counseling staff. Average cost-effectiveness ratios were computed for drinking and driving, injuries, vehicular citations, and negative social consequences. Using estimates of the marginal effect of motivational interviewing in reducing drinking and driving, estimates of traffic fatality risk from drinking-and-driving youth, and national life tables, the societal costs per quality-adjusted life year saved by motivational interviewing relative to standard care were also estimated. Alcohol-attributable traffic fatality risks were estimated using national databases. RESULTS: Intervention costs per participant were $81 for standard care, $170 for motivational interviewing with standard screening, and $173 for motivational interviewing with proactive screening. The cost-effectiveness ratios for motivational interviewing were more favorable than standard care across all study outcomes and better for men than women. The societal cost per quality-adjusted life year of motivational interviewing was $8,795. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust in terms of variability in parameter estimates.

6905,Cost effectiveness of home ultraviolet B phototherapy for psoriasis: economic evaluation of a randomised controlled trial (PLUTO study),"OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs and cost effectiveness of phototherapy with ultraviolet B light provided at home compared with outpatient ultraviolet B phototherapy for psoriasis. DESIGN: Cost utility, cost effectiveness, and cost minimisation analyses performed alongside a pragmatic randomised clinical trial (the PLUTO study) at the end of phototherapy (mean 17.6 weeks) and at one year after the end of phototherapy (mean 68.4 weeks). SETTING: Secondary care, provided by a dermatologist in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: 196 adults with psoriasis who were clinically eligible for narrowband (TL-01) ultraviolet B phototherapy were recruited from the dermatology departments of 14 hospitals and were followed until the end of phototherapy. From the end of phototherapy onwards, follow-up was continued for an unselected, consecutive group of 105 patients for one year after end of phototherapy. INTERVENTIONS: Ultraviolet B phototherapy provided at home (intervention) and conventional outpatient ultraviolet B phototherapy (control) in a setting reflecting routine practice in the Netherlands. Both treatments used narrowband ultraviolet B lamps (TL-01). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total costs to society, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as calculated using utilities measured by the EQ-5D questionnaire, and the number of days with a relevant treatment effect (>/=50% improvement of the baseline self administered psoriasis area and severity index (SAPASI)). RESULTS: Home phototherapy is at least as effective and safe as outpatient phototherapy, therefore allowing cost minimisation analyses (simply comparing costs). The average total costs by the end of phototherapy were euro800 for home treatment and euro752 for outpatient treatment, showing an incremental cost per patient of euro48 (95% CI euro-77 to euro174). The average total costs by one year after the end of phototherapy were euro1272 and euro1148 respectively (difference euro124, 95% CI euro-155 to euro403). Cost utility analyses revealed that patients experienced equal health benefits-that is, a gain of 0.296 versus 0.291 QALY (home v outpatient) by the end of phototherapy (difference 0.0052, -0.0244 to 0.0348) and 1.153 versus 1.126 QALY by one year after the end of phototherapy (difference 0.0267, -0.024 to 0.078). Incremental costs per QALY gained were euro9276 and euro4646 respectively, both amounts well below the normally accepted standard of euro20 000 per QALY. Cost effectiveness analyses indicated that the mean number of days with a relevant treatment effect was 42.4 versus 55.3 by the end of phototherapy (difference -12.9, -23.4 to -2.4). By one year after the end of phototherapy the number of days with a relevant treatment effect were 216.5 and 210.4 respectively (6.1, -41.1 to 53.2), yielding an incremental cost of euro20 per additional day with a relevant treatment effect. CONCLUSIONS: Home ultraviolet B phototherapy for psoriasis is not more expensive than phototherapy in an outpatient setting and proved to be cost effective. As both treatments are at least equally effective and patients express a preference for home treatment, the authors conclude that home phototherapy should be the primary treatment option for patients who are eligible for phototherapy with ultraviolet B light.

6907,The cost-effectiveness of directly observed highly-active antiretroviral therapy in the third trimester in HIV-infected pregnant women,"BACKGROUND: In HIV-infected pregnant women, viral suppression prevents mother-to-child HIV transmission. Directly observed highly-active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) enhances virological suppression, and could prevent transmission. Our objective was to project the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of directly observed administration of antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A mathematical model was created to simulate cohorts of one million asymptomatic HIV-infected pregnant women on HAART, with women randomly assigned self-administered or directly observed antiretroviral therapy (DOT), or no HAART, in a series of Monte Carlo simulations. Our primary outcome was the quality-adjusted life expectancy in years (QALY) of infants born to HIV-infected women, with the rates of Caesarean section and HIV-transmission after DOT use as intermediate outcomes. Both self-administered HAART and DOT were associated with decreased costs and increased life-expectancy relative to no HAART. The use of DOT was associated with a relative risk of HIV transmission of 0.39 relative to conventional HAART; was highly cost-effective in the cohort as a whole (cost-utility ratio $14,233 per QALY); and was cost-saving in women whose viral loads on self-administered HAART would have exceeded 1000 copies/ml. Results were stable in wide-ranging sensitivity analyses, with directly observed therapy cost-saving or highly cost-effective in almost all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the best available data, programs that optimize adherence to HAART through direct observation in pregnancy have the potential to diminish mother-to-child HIV transmission in a highly cost-effective manner. Targeted use of DOT in pregnant women with high viral loads, who could otherwise receive self-administered HAART would be a cost-saving intervention.

6909,Effect of preventive primary care outreach on health related quality of life among older adults at risk of functional decline: randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of a provider initiated primary care outreach intervention compared with usual care among older adults at risk of functional decline. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Patients enrolled with 35 family physicians in five primary care networks in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Patients were eligible if they were 75 years of age or older and were not receiving home care services. Of 3166 potentially eligible patients, 2662 (84%) completed the validated postal questionnaire used to determine risk of functional decline. Of 1724 patients who met the risk criteria, 769 (45%) agreed to participate and 719 were randomised. INTERVENTION: The 12 month intervention, provided by experienced home care nurses in 2004-6, consisted of a comprehensive initial assessment using the resident assessment instrument for home care; collaborative care planning with patients, their families, and family physicians; health promotion; and referral to community health and social support services. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years (QALYs), use and costs of health and social services, functional status, self rated health, and mortality. RESULTS: The mean difference in QALYs between intervention and control patients during the study period was not statistically significant (0.017, 95% confidence interval -0.022 to 0.056; P=0.388). The mean difference in overall cost of prescription drugs and services between the intervention and control groups was not statistically significant, (-$C165 ( pound107; euro118; $162), 95% confidence interval -$C16 545 to $C16 214; P=0.984). Changes over 12 months in functional status and self rated health were not significantly different between the intervention and control groups. Ten patients died in each group.

6910,Cost-effectiveness of a short stay admission programme for breast cancer surgery,"BACKGROUND: Short stay (admission, surgery, and discharge the same day or within 24 hours) following breast cancer surgery is part of an established care protocol but as yet not well implemented in Europe. Alongside a before-after multi-centre implementation study, an economic evaluation was performed exploring the cost-effectiveness of a short stay programme (SSP) versus care as usual (CAU). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the implementation study, 324 patients were included. In the economic evaluation a societal perspective was applied with a six week time horizon. Cost data were obtained from Case Record Forms and cost diaries. Effectiveness was assessed by calculating Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), using the EuroQol-5D. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental costs per QALY. RESULTS: Mean societal costs decreased by euro955,- (95% CI euro - 2104,- to euro157,-) for patients in SSP (n=127) compared with CAU (n=135). Mean healthcare costs differed euro883,- (95% CI euro - 1560,- to euro870,-) in favour of SSP. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio could not be calculated due to similar effectiveness for both groups, i.e. the difference in QALYs was zero. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the probability that SSP was more cost-effective than CAU was over 90% in the base-case analysis.

6912,Cost-effectiveness of a short stay admission programme for breast cancer surgery,"BACKGROUND: Short stay (admission, surgery, and discharge the same day or within 24 hours) following breast cancer surgery is part of an established care protocol but as yet not well implemented in Europe. Alongside a before-after multi-centre implementation study, an economic evaluation was performed exploring the cost-effectiveness of a short stay programme (SSP) versus care as usual (CAU). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the implementation study, 324 patients were included. In the economic evaluation a societal perspective was applied with a six week time horizon. Cost data were obtained from Case Record Forms and cost diaries. Effectiveness was assessed by calculating Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), using the EuroQol-5D. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental costs per QALY. RESULTS: Mean societal costs decreased by euro955,- (95% CI euro - 2104,- to euro157,-) for patients in SSP (n=127) compared with CAU (n=135). Mean healthcare costs differed euro883,- (95% CI euro - 1560,- to euro870,-) in favour of SSP. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio could not be calculated due to similar effectiveness for both groups, i.e. the difference in QALYs was zero. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that the probability that SSP was more cost-effective than CAU was over 90% in the base-case analysis.

6914,Human papillomavirus transmission and cost-effectiveness of introducing quadrivalent HPV vaccination in Denmark,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to simulate human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in a heterosexual population and subsequently analyze the incremental costs and effects of introducing a vaccination program against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in Denmark compared with screening alone. METHODS: The analysis was performed in two phases. First, an agent-based transmission model was developed that described the HPV transmission without and with HPV vaccination. Second, an analysis of the incremental costs and effects was performed. The results of prevalence estimates of HPV, genital warts, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN1-3), and cervical cancer in the model simulations before and after introduction of HPV vaccination were extrapolated to the Danish population figures. Incremental costs and effects were then estimated. Future costs and effects were discounted. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness ratios for annual vaccination of 12-year-old girls, with a vaccination rate of 70 percent without a catch-up program, were estimated at approximately 1,917 euro per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY, 3 percent discount rate) and 10,846 euro/QALY (5 percent discount rate), given a 62-year time horizon.

6917,Cost-effectiveness of enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) for the treatment of stable angina in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) compared with no treatment as additional therapy to usual care for the treatment of chronic stable angina from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: The study design was a systematic review of published evidence, use of expert clinical opinion, and decision analytic cost-effectiveness model. The systematic review was conducted and statistical methods used to synthesize the effectiveness evidence from randomized control trials. Formal methods were used to elicit opinion from clinical experts where no evidence was available. These provide informed ""priors"" on key model parameters. A decision analytic model was developed to assess the costs and health consequences associated with the primary outcome of the trials over a lifetime time horizon. The main outcome measures were costs from a health service perspective and outcomes measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EECP was 18,643 pound sterling for each additional QALY, with a probability of being cost-effective of 0.44 and 0.70 at cost-effectiveness thresholds of 20,000 pound sterling and 30,000 pound sterling per QALY gained, respectively. Results were sensitive to the duration of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) benefits from treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The long-term maintenance of HRQoL benefits of EECP is central to the estimate of cost-effectiveness. The results from a single randomized control trial do not provide firm evidence of the clinical or cost-effectiveness of EECP in stable angina.

6918,Economic evaluation of enhanced staff contact for the promotion of breastfeeding for low birth weight infants,"OBJECTIVES: There is evidence that breastmilk feeding reduces mortality and short and long-term morbidity among infants born too soon or too small. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of enhanced staff contact for mothers with infants in a neonatal unit with a birth weight of 500-2,500 g from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. METHODS: A decision-tree model linked clinical outcomes with long-term health outcomes. The study population was divided into three weight bands: 500-999 g, 1000-1,749 g, and 1,750-2,500 g. Clinical and resource use data were obtained from literature reviews. The measure of benefit was quality-adjusted life-years. Uncertainty was evaluated using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The intervention was less costly and more effective than the comparator in the base-case analysis for each birth weight group. The results were quite robust to the sensitivity analyses performed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first economic evaluation in this complex field and offers a model to be developed in future research.

6921,Economic appraisal of Ontario's Universal Influenza Immunization Program: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: In July 2000, the province of Ontario, Canada, initiated a universal influenza immunization program (UIIP) to provide free seasonal influenza vaccines for the entire population. This is the first large-scale program of its kind worldwide. The objective of this study was to conduct an economic appraisal of Ontario's UIIP compared to a targeted influenza immunization program (TIIP). METHODS AND FINDINGS: A cost-utility analysis using Ontario health administrative data was performed. The study was informed by a companion ecological study comparing physician visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths between 1997 and 2004 in Ontario and nine other Canadian provinces offering targeted immunization programs. The relative change estimates from pre-2000 to post-2000 as observed in other provinces were applied to pre-UIIP Ontario event rates to calculate the expected number of events had Ontario continued to offer targeted immunization. Main outcome measures were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs in 2006 Canadian dollars, and incremental cost-utility ratios (incremental cost per QALY gained). Program and other costs were drawn from Ontario sources. Utility weights were obtained from the literature. The incremental cost of the program per QALY gained was calculated from the health care payer perspective. Ontario's UIIP costs approximately twice as much as a targeted program but reduces influenza cases by 61% and mortality by 28%, saving an estimated 1,134 QALYs per season overall. Reducing influenza cases decreases health care services cost by 52%. Most cost savings can be attributed to hospitalizations avoided. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is Can$10,797/QALY gained. Results are most sensitive to immunization cost and number of deaths averted.

6922,"One-year mortality, quality of life and predicted life-time cost-utility in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure","ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: High daily intensive care unit (ICU) costs are associated with the use of mechanical ventilation (MV) to treat acute respiratory failure (ARF), and assessment of quality of life (QOL) after critical illness and cost-effectiveness analyses are warranted. METHODS: Nationwide, prospective multicentre observational study in 25 Finnish ICUs. During an eight-week study period 958 consecutive adult ICU patients were treated with ventilatory support over 6 hours. Of those 958, 619 (64.6%) survived one year, of whom 288 (46.5%) answered the quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D). We calculated EQ-5D index and predicted lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained using the age- and sex-matched life expectancy for survivors after one year. For expired patients the exact lifetime was used. We divided all hospital costs for all ARF patients by the number of hospital survivors, and by all predicted lifetime QALYs. We also adjusted for those who died before one year and for those with missing QOL to be able to estimate the total QALYs. RESULTS: One-year mortality was 35% (95% CI 32 to 38%). For the 288 respondents median [IQR] EQ-5D index after one year was lower than that of the age- and sex-matched general population 0.70 [0.45 to 0.89] vs. 0.84 [0.81 to 0.88]. For these 288, the mean (SD) predicted lifetime QALYs was 15.4 (13.3). After adjustment for missing QOL the mean predicted lifetime (SD) QALYs was 11.3 (13.0) for all the 958 ARF patients. The mean estimated costs were 20.739 euro per hospital survivor, and mean predicted lifetime cost-utility for all ARF patients was 1391 euro per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Despite lower health-related QOL compared to reference values, our result suggests that cost per hospital survivor and lifetime cost-utility remain reasonable regardless of age, disease severity, and type or duration of ventilation support in patients with ARF.",2010-01-06394,20384998,Crit Care,Rita Linko,2010,14 / 2,R60,No,20384998,"Rita Linko; One-year mortality, quality of life and predicted life-time cost-utility in critically ill patients with acute respiratory failure, Crit Care, 2010-Apr-12; 14(2):1466-609X; R60",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Use of mechanical ventilation (MV) vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,1835.31,Euro,2008,3248.74
6923,A Cost Utility Analysis of Interdisciplinary Early Intervention Versus Treatment as Usual For High-Risk Acute Low Back Pain Patients,"Abstract Chronic pain is a costly and debilitating condition that has proven difficult to treat, solely with medical interventions, due to the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors in its onset and persistence. Many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of interdisciplinary treatment that includes psychosocial interventions for low back pain. Nevertheless, these interventions continue to be under-utilized due to concerns of cost and applicability. The present study utilized a cost utility analysis to evaluate effectiveness and associated costs of interdisciplinary early intervention for individuals with acute low back pain that was identified as high-risk for becoming chronic. Treatment effectiveness was evaluated using a standard pain measure and quality-adjusted life years, and associated medical and employment costs were gathered for 1 year. Results indicated that subjects improved significantly from pretreatment to 1-year follow-up, and that the early intervention group reported fewer health-care visits and missed workdays than the treatment as usual group. The majority of 1,000 bootstrapped samples demonstrated the dominance of the early intervention program as being both more effective and less costly from a societal perspective. The early intervention treatment was the preferred option in over 85% of samples within an established range of acceptable costs. These results are encouraging evidence for the cost-effectiveness of interdisciplinary intervention and the benefits of targeted early treatment.",2010-01-06395,20384967,Pain Pract,Mark D Rogerson,2010,/,,No,20384967,"Mark D Rogerson; A Cost Utility Analysis of Interdisciplinary Early Intervention Versus Treatment as Usual For High-Risk Acute Low Back Pain Patients, Pain Pract, 2010-Apr-05; ():1533-2500",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Received early intervention treatment vs. Received medical treatment as usual,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-118900,United States,2008,-142927.07

A decision analytic model was developed based on a double-blind randomized trial that compared posaconazole with fluconazole antifungal prophylaxis in recipients of allogeneic HSCT with GVHD who were receiving immunosuppressive therapy (Ullmann et al., N Engl J Med 356:335-347, 2007). Clinical events were modeled with chance nodes reflecting probabilities of IFIs, IFI-related death, and death from other causes. Data on life expectancy, quality-of-life, medical resource consumption, and costs were obtained from the literature. The total cost with posaconazole amounted to <euro>9,428 (95% uncertainty interval <euro>7,743-11,388), which is <euro>4,566 (<euro>2,460-6,854) more than those with fluconazole. Posaconazole prophylaxis resulted in 0.17 (0.02-0.36) quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained compared to fluconazole prophylaxis, corresponding to an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of <euro>26,225 per QALY gained. A scenario analysis demonstrated that at an increased background IFI risk (from 9% to 15%) the ICER was <euro>13,462 per QALY. Given the underlying data and assumptions, posaconazole prophylaxis is expected to be cost-effective relative to fluconazole in recipients of allogeneic HSCT developing GVHD in the Netherlands.

6928,Cost-effectiveness analysis of prophylactic cervical cancer vaccination in Japanese women,"INTRODUCTION: The incidence of cervical cancer (CC) is high in Japan and is further increasing among women younger than 30 years. This burden could be reduced by the implementation of a CC vaccine, but its cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: We quantified the clinical impact and assessed the cost-effectiveness of adding CC vaccination at age 12 to the current screening in place in Japan with a lifetime Markov model adapted to the Japanese setting. Transition probabilities and utility values were obtained from public databases. Direct costs for treatment and screening were estimated using Japanese medical fees. Annual costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the age at vaccination, the vaccine characteristics, the discount rates, the proportion of human papillomavirus types 16/18 in cancer, and the screening coverage. RESULTS: Vaccinating a 12-year-old cohort was predicted to reduce CC incidence and deaths from CC by 73%. These clinical effects were associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of yen1.8 million per quality-adjusted life year gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccinating all 10- to 45-year-old women was yen2.8 million per quality-adjusted life year, still below the threshold value. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a CC vaccination in Japan could reduce the CC burden in a very cost-effective manner for women up to 45 years.",2010-01-06402,20375802,Int J Gynecol Cancer,R Konno,2010,22 / 7,385-92,No,20375802,"R Konno; Cost-effectiveness analysis of prophylactic cervical cancer vaccination in Japanese women, Int J Gynecol Cancer, ; 22(7):1048-891X; 385-92",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic cervical cancer vaccination vs. No vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1810023,Japan,2006,19984.58
6929,The Cost-Effectiveness of a Randomized Controlled Trial to Establish the Relative Efficacy of Vitamin K1 Compared with Alendronate,"PURPOSE: The authors aimed to evaluate whether vitamin K1 or alendronate (the recommended treatment in England and Wales for postmenopausal women with a previous fracture) appeared to be the more cost-effective treatment for fracture prevention. Furthermore, expected value of sample information (EVSI) analyses were undertaken to estimate whether a head-to-head trial of alendronate and vitamin K1 would be considered cost effective. METHOD: A published osteoporosis model structure, populated with data from literature reviews, was used to evaluate the costs and quality-adjusted life-years associated with each intervention being provided to women at high risk of fracture, given current information. A lifetime horizon and a national health service and personal social services cost perspective were used. Observed outcomes from head-to-head randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of predetermined sizes were simulated and synthesized with existing data to formulate posterior distributions, which were used to estimate the more cost-effective treatment given these additional data. The EVSI was estimated and the expected net benefit of sampling (ENBS) calculated by subtracting the proposed trial costs. RESULTS: Given current information, vitamin K1 is expected to dominate alendronate. However, this was subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty; dominance was reversed when it was assumed that vitamin K1 had no effect on hip fractures. EVSI analysis indicated that an RCT of 2000 or 5000 women per arm produced high, and comparable, ENBS. These results were maintained in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that an RCT recruiting between 2000 and 5000 women per arm to evaluate the relative efficacy of alendronate and vitamin K1 appears to be cost effective for informing decision making in England and Wales.",2010-01-06403,20375420,Med Decis Making,Matt D Stevenson,2010,/,,No,20375420,"Matt D Stevenson; The Cost-Effectiveness of a Randomized Controlled Trial to Establish the Relative Efficacy of Vitamin K1 Compared with Alendronate, Med Decis Making, 2010-Apr-07; ():0272-989X",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vitamin K1 10mg per day (Assumed to have identical efficacy and adverse event profiles with the dose of 5mg per day) vs. Alendronate,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-6493.51,United Kingdom,2008,-14475.52

Recently, we compared the clinical effectiveness of unsupported, online CCBT with treatment as usual (TAU) and a combination of CCBT and TAU (CCBT plus TAU) for depression. The study is registered at the Netherlands Trial Register, part of the Dutch Cochrane Centre (ISRCTN47481236). AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of CCBT compared with TAU and CCBT plus TAU. METHOD: Costs, depression severity and quality of life were measured for 12 months. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed from a societal perspective. Uncertainty was dealt with by bootstrap replications and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Costs were lowest for the CCBT group.

6936,Cost effectiveness analysis of hemiarthroplasty and total shoulder arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: Total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) and hemiarthroplasty (HA) are two viable surgical treatment options for glenohumeral osteoarthritis. Recent systematic reviews and randomized trials suggest that TSA, while more costly initially, may have superior outcomes with regard to pain, function and quality of life with lower revision rates. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of TSA with HA. METHODS: A Markov decision model was constructed for a cost-utility analysis of TSA compared to HA in a cohort of 64-year-old patients. Outcome probabilities and effectiveness were derived from the literature. Costs were estimated from the societal perspective using the national average Medicare reimbursement for the procedures in 2008 US dollars. Effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. Principal outcome measures were average incremental costs, incremental effectiveness, incremental QALYs, and net health benefits. RESULTS: In the base case, HA resulted in a lower number of average QALYs gained at a higher average cost to society and was, therefore, dominated by the TSA strategy for the treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis. The cost effectiveness ratio for TSA and HA were $957/QALY and $1,194/QALY respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that if the utility of TSA is equal to, or revision rate lower than HA, TSA continues to be a dominant strategy. CONCLUSION: Total shoulder arthroplasty with a cemented glenoid is a cost-effective procedure, resulting in greater utility for the patient at a lower overall cost to the payer.

6937,Cost effectiveness of etoricoxib versus celecoxib and non-selective NSAIDS in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis,"To evaluate the cost effectiveness of etoricoxib (90 mg/day) relative to celecoxib (200 or 400 mg/day), and the non-selective NSAIDs naproxen (1000 mg/day) and diclofenac (150 mg/day) in the initial treatment of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) from the UK NHS perspective. A Bayesian cost-effectiveness model was developed to estimate the costs and benefits associated with initiating AS treatment with etoricoxib, celecoxib, diclofenac or naproxen. Efficacy, safety and medical resource and cost data were obtained from the literature. The obtained efficacy estimates were synthesized with a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. Treatment benefit and degree of disease activity, as reflected with Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI) and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) scores, were related to QALYs and AS-specific costs (related to BASDAI). Other cost outcomes related to drug acquisition, and gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety. Uncertainty in the source data was translated into uncertainty in cost-effectiveness estimates and therefore decision uncertainty. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. There was a >98% probability that treatment with etoricoxib results in greater QALYs than the other interventions. Over a 30-year time horizon, starting AS treatment with etoricoxib was associated with about 0.4 more QALYs than the other interventions. At 2 years there was a 77% probability that etoricoxib had the lowest cost. This increased to >99% at 30 years. Etoricoxib is expected to save 13 620 UK pounds (year 2007 values) relative to celecoxib (200/400 mg), 9957 UK pounds relative to diclofenac and 9863 UK pounds relative to naproxen. For a willingness-to-pay ceiling ratio of 20 000 UK pounds per QALY, there was a >97% probability that etoricoxib was the most cost-effective treatment.

6941,Cost effectiveness of pregabalin in the treatment of fibromyalgia from a UK perspective,"BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition associated with widespread pain, sleep disturbance and disability. Disease related costs are high and effective treatment options few. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of pregabalin in the treatment of fibromyalgia. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed comparing pregabalin 300 mg or 450 mg against placebo, duloxetine 60 mg or 120 mg, gabapentin, tramadol and amitriptyline. After a 12 week treatment phase patients who responded to treatment entered an ongoing treatment phase using a Markov model in which patients maintained response, lost response or dropped out. The base case considered patients with severe fibromyalgia defined as a Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire score of >or=59 and a pain score of >or=6.5 at baseline. Response rates for pregabalin and placebo were taken from three randomised trials, and a 1 year open-label extension study was used for long-term parameters. Response was defined as a >or=30% improvement over baseline in pain score and a patient global impression of change rating of much improved or very much improved. Relative rates of response for other comparators over placebo were extracted from a systematic review of published randomised controlled studies. The primary effectiveness endpoint was Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Utilities gained over baseline were estimated by applying the SF-6D utility algorithm to SF-36 data collected in the pregabalin trials. Resource use associated with fibromyalgia management was estimated from published studies and costs were estimated from the UK NHS perspective at 2008 prices. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3.5%. Non-parametric bootstrapping analysis was used to generate confidence intervals. RESULTS: In the base case, pregabalin 300 mg and 450 mg increased cost per patient by pound601 (95% CI: 532, 669) and pound653 (587, 727) and improved QALYs per patient by 0.03 (-0.03, 0.06) and 0.03 (-0.04, 0.08) respectively compared to placebo. The cost per QALY gained (CQG) was pound23,166 and pound22,533.

6943,Single-dose versus multiple-dose antibiotic prophylaxis for the surgical treatment of closed fractures,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent meta-analyses have suggested similar wound infection rates when using single- or multiple-dose antibiotic prophylaxis in the operative management of closed long bone fractures. In order to assist clinicians in choosing the optimal prophylaxis strategy, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing single- and multiple-dose prophylaxis. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the two prophylactic strategies was performed using time horizons of 60 days and 1 year. Infection probabilities, costs, and quality-adjusted life days (QALD) for each strategy were estimated from the literature. All costs were reported in 2007 US dollars. A base case analysis was performed for the surgical treatment of a closed ankle fracture. Sensitivity analysis was performed for all variables, including probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Single-dose prophylaxis results in lower cost and a similar amount of quality-adjusted life days gained. The single-dose strategy had an average cost of $2,576 for an average gain of 272 QALD. Multiple doses had an average cost of $2,596 for 272 QALD gained. These results are sensitive to the incidence of surgical site infection and deep wound infection for the single-dose treatment arm. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using all model variables also demonstrated preference for the single-dose strategy.

6945,Thiopurine S-methyltranferase testing in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: a pharmacogenetic cost-effectiveness analysis,"Azathioprine in combination with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and steroids is a standard therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Its use, however, is limited by its side effects, principally leukopenia. A genotypic assay, thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), has been developed that can potentially identify those at risk for developing leukopenia with azathioprine, and thereby limit its toxicity. In those with abnormal TPMT activity, azathioprine can be started at lower dose or an alternate regimen selected. Determine the cost-effectiveness of a treatment strategy using TPMT testing before initiation of azathioprine, NAC, and steroids in IPF by performing a computer-based simulation. We developed a decision analytic model comparing three strategies: azathioprine, NAC and steroids with and without prior TPMT testing, and conservative therapy, consisting of only supportive measures. Prevalence of abnormal TPMT alleles and complication rates of therapy were taken from the literature. We assumed a 12.5% incidence of abnormal TPMT alleles, 4% overall incidence of leukopenia while taking azathioprine, and that azathioprine, NAC, and steroids in combination reduced IPF disease progression by 14% during 12 months. TPMT testing before azathioprine, NAC, and steroids was the most effective and most costly strategy. The marginal cost-effectiveness of the TPMT testing strategy was $49,156 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained versus conservative treatment. Compared with azathioprine, NAC and steroids without prior testing, the TPMT testing strategy cost only $29,662 per QALY gained. In sensitivity analyses, when the prevalence of abnormal TPMT alleles was higher than our base case, TPMT was ""cost-effective."" At prevalence rates lower than our base case, it was not.

6949,Cost-Effectiveness of Strategies for Diagnosing Pulmonary Embolism Among Emergency Department Patients Presenting With Undifferentiated Symptoms,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Symptoms associated with pulmonary embolism can be nonspecific and similar to many competing diagnoses, leading to excessive costly testing and treatment, as well as missed diagnoses. Objective studies are essential for diagnosis. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic strategies in an emergency department (ED) for patients presenting with undifferentiated symptoms suggestive of pulmonary embolism. METHODS: Using a probabilistic decision model, we evaluated the incremental costs and effectiveness (quality-adjusted life-years gained) of 60 testing strategies for 5 patient pretest categories (distinguished by Wells score [high, moderate, or low] and whether deep venous thrombosis is clinically suspected). We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base case, for all patient pretest categories, the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy is to use an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer test, followed by compression ultrasonography of the lower extremities if the D-dimer is above a specified cutoff. The level of the preferred cutoff varies with the Wells pretest category and whether a deep venous thrombosis is clinically suspected. D-dimer cutoffs higher than the current recommended cutoff were often preferred for patients with even moderate and high Wells categories. Compression ultrasonography accuracy had to decrease below commonly cited levels in the literature before it was not part of a preferred strategy. CONCLUSION: When pulmonary embolism is suspected in the ED, use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer assay, often at cutoffs higher than those currently in use (for patients in whom deep venous thrombosis is not clinically suspected), followed by compression ultrasonography as appropriate, can reduce costs and improve outcomes.",2010-01-06438,20605261,Ann Emerg Med,Ram S Duriseti,2010,/,,No,20605261,"Ram S Duriseti; Cost-Effectiveness of Strategies for Diagnosing Pulmonary Embolism Among Emergency Department Patients Presenting With Undifferentiated Symptoms, Ann Emerg Med, 2010-Jun-02; ():0196-0644",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,D-dimer and then compression ultrasonography (CUS) if D-dimer >cutoff IV vs. Unspecified,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2008,Not Stated

We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base case, for all patient pretest categories, the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy is to use an initial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer test, followed by compression ultrasonography of the lower extremities if the D-dimer is above a specified cutoff. The level of the preferred cutoff varies with the Wells pretest category and whether a deep venous thrombosis is clinically suspected. D-dimer cutoffs higher than the current recommended cutoff were often preferred for patients with even moderate and high Wells categories. Compression ultrasonography accuracy had to decrease below commonly cited levels in the literature before it was not part of a preferred strategy. CONCLUSION: When pulmonary embolism is suspected in the ED, use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay D-dimer assay, often at cutoffs higher than those currently in use (for patients in whom deep venous thrombosis is not clinically suspected), followed by compression ultrasonography as appropriate, can reduce costs and improve outcomes.",2010-01-06438,20605261,Ann Emerg Med,Ram S Duriseti,2010,/,,No,20605261,"Ram S Duriseti; Cost-Effectiveness of Strategies for Diagnosing Pulmonary Embolism Among Emergency Department Patients Presenting With Undifferentiated Symptoms, Ann Emerg Med, 2010-Jun-02; ():0196-0644",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,D-dimer and then compression ultrasonography (CUS) if D-dimer >cutoff V vs. Unspecified,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2008,Not Stated
6951,Cost-Effectiveness of Strategies for Diagnosing Pulmonary Embolism Among Emergency Department Patients Presenting With Undifferentiated Symptoms,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Symptoms associated with pulmonary embolism can be nonspecific and similar to many competing diagnoses, leading to excessive costly testing and treatment, as well as missed diagnoses.

6952,Expanding access to HAART: a cost-effective approach for treating and preventing HIV,"OBJECTIVE:: HIV continues to present a substantial global health burden. Given the high direct medical costs associated with the disease, prevention of new transmission is an important element in limiting economic burden. In addition to providing therapeutic benefit, treatment with HAART has potential to prevent transmission of HIV. The objective in this study was to perform an economic evaluation of the incremental net benefit associated with an intervention to expand treatment with HAART in British Columbia, Canada. DESIGN:: A mathematical model describing transmission of HIV, integrated with a microsimulation model describing the clinical and economic course of HIV. METHODS:: The primary outcome was the incremental net benefit of expanding treatment with HAART from 50 to 75% of clinically eligible individuals in British Columbia, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$ 50 000 per quality-adjusted life year. Direct medical costs included were antiretroviral and nonantiretroviral medications, hospitalizations, physician visits, and laboratory tests. The mathematical and microsimulation models were based on patient characteristics observed in British Columbia. Longitudinal data described health services utilization, clinical progression, and survival for all individuals receiving treatment for HIV in British Columbia. RESULTS:: Over 30 years, the HAART expansion scenario was associated with a net benefit of US$ 900 million (95% confidence interval US$ 493 million to 1.45 billion). CONCLUSION:: Increasing the HAART treatment rate from 50 to 75% of clinically eligible individuals in British Columbia appears to be a cost-effective strategy based on this model. These cost-effectiveness results are consistent with public health objectives: all individuals who are eligible for an established life-saving treatment should receive it.",2010-01-06444,20588171,AIDS,Karissa M Johnston,2010,/,,No,20588171,"Karissa M Johnston; Expanding access to HAART: a cost-effective approach for treating and preventing HIV, AIDS, 2010-Jun-25; ():0269-9370",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Expanding highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) treatment coverage from 50% to 75% vs. HAART treatment coverage of 50%,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,10000,Canada,2005,10945.49
6953,Cost-effectiveness of oral alitretinoin in patients with severe chronic hand eczema: a long-term analysis from a Swiss perspective,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The impact on patients suffering from chronic hand eczema (CHE) is enormous, as no licensed systemic treatment option with proven efficacy for CHE is available. Alitretinoin is a novel agent which showed high clinical efficacy in patients with severe, refractory CHE. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of alitretinoin for CHE patient treatment from a Swiss third party payer perspective. A further objective of this study was to determine the burden of disease in Switzerland. METHODS: A long-term Markov cohort simulation model was used to estimate direct medical costs (EUR) and clinical effectiveness (quality adjusted life years, QALYs) of treating severe CHE patients with alitretinoin. Comparison was against the standard treatment of supportive care (optimised emollient therapy). Information on response rates were derived from a randomized controlled clinical trial. Costs were considered from the perspective of the Swiss health system. Swiss epidemiological data was derived from official Swiss Statistic institutions. RESULTS: Annual costs of alitretinoin treatment accounted for EUR 2'212. After a time horizon of 22.4 years, average remaining long-term costs accounted for EUR 42'208 or EUR 38'795 in the alitretinoin and the standard treatment arm, respectively. Compared with the standard therapy, the addition of alitretinoin yielded an average gain of 0.230 QALYs at the end of the simulation. Accordingly, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio resulted in EUR 14'816/QALY gained. These results were robust to changes in key model assumptions. CONCLUSION: The therapy for CHE patients is currently insufficient. In our long-term model we identified the treatment with alitretinoin as a cost-effective alternative for the therapy of CHE patients in Switzerland.",2010-01-06448,20579358,BMC Dermatol,Patricia R Blank,2010,10 / 1,4,No,20579358,"Patricia R Blank; Cost-effectiveness of oral alitretinoin in patients with severe chronic hand eczema: a long-term analysis from a Swiss perspective, BMC Dermatol, 2010-Jun-25; 10(1):1471-5945; 4",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Alitretinoin 30 mg once daily vs. Standard treatment of supportive care (optimised emollient therapy),Not Stated,75 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,22 Years,3.50,3.50,14816,Euro,2008,26226.27
6954,Economic Efficiency of Genetic Screening to Inform the Use of Abacavir Sulfate in the Treatment of HIV,"Background: Abacavir sulfate (abacavir) is associated with a hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) that affects 5-8% of patients. While serious complications are rare, failure to identify it, or abacavir re-challenge following HSR, can be fatal. Genetic screening for HLA-B*5701 can identify patients who are likely to experience an HSR and reduces the incidence of the reaction. Objective: We assessed the intrinsic and practical value, from the US healthcare system perspective, of prospective HLA-B*5701 screening among a population of antiretroviral-naive patients without elevated risk factors for cardiovascular disease, plasma HIV RNA >100 000 copies/mL, or pre-existing renal insufficiency. Methods: Two approaches were used to evaluate the costs and benefits of prospective screening. First, the efficiency of HLA-B*5701 screening compared with no screening prior to abacavir initiation (intrinsic value of screening) was evaluated using a 60-day decision-tree model. Next, the practical value of screening was assessed using a lifetime discrete-event simulation model that compared HLA-B*5701 screening prior to abacavir use versus initiation with a tenofovir-containing regimen. Screening-effectiveness parameters were taken from an open-label trial that incorporated screening prior to abacavir initiation and other published studies. Treatment efficacy was derived from clinical trials. Modelling assumptions, costs ($US, year 2007 values) and other parameters were derived from published sources, primary data analysis and expert opinion. Multiple one-way sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. The primary outcome measure for the short-term screening versus no screening analysis was cost per patient. For the long-term analysis, outcomes were presented as QALYs. Costs and effects were discounted at 3% per year. Results: Over the first 60 days of treatment, prospective screening prior to abacavir initiation cost an additional $US17 per patient and avoided 537 HSRs per 10 000 patients. The per-patient cost of screening was sensitive to the cost of the genetic test, HSR costs and screening performance. In the lifetime model, screening-informed abacavir use was more effective and less costly than initiation with a tenofovir-containing regimen in the base case and in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Our results suggest that prospective HLA-B*5701 screening prior to abacavir initiation produces cost savings and should become a standard component of HIV care.",2010-01-06450,20575592,Pharmacoeconomics,Teresa L Kauf,2010,/,,Yes,20575592,"Teresa L Kauf; Economic Efficiency of Genetic Screening to Inform the Use of Abacavir Sulfate in the Treatment of HIV, Pharmacoeconomics, 2010-Jun-24; ():1179-2027",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Genetic screening for HLA-B*5701, abacavir sulfate (ABC) treatment regime if test negative vs. Abacavir sulfate (ABC) treatment regime without genetic screening for HLA-B*5701",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-281352.22,United States,2007,-351192.95
6955,Cost-utility of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) compared with corticosteroids for the treatment of Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP) in Canada,"ABSTRACT: Objectives: Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has demonstrated improvement in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) patients in placebo controlled trials. However, IVIG is also much more expensive than alternative treatments such as corticosteroids. The objective of the paper is to evaluate, from a Canadian perspective, the cost-effectiveness of IVIG compared to corticosteroid treatment of CIDP. METHODS: A markov model was used to evaluate the costs and QALYs for IVIG and corticosteroids over 5 years of treatment for CIDP. Patients initially responding to IVIG could remain a responder or relapse every 12 week model cycle. Non-responding IVIG patients were assumed to be switched to corticosteroids. Patients on corticosteroids were at risk of a number of adverse events (fracture, diabetes, glaucoma, cataract, serious infection) in each cycle. RESULTS: Over the 5 year time horizon, the model estimated the incremental costs and QALYs of IVIG treatment compared to corticosteroid treatment to be $124,065 and 0.177 respectively. The incremental cost per QALY gained of IVIG was estimated to be $687,287. The cost per QALY of IVIG was sensitive to the assumptions regarding frequency and dosing of maintenance IVIG.

6956,Quality of life and health-related utility analysis of adults with moderate and severe atopic dermatitis treated with tacrolimus ointment vs. topical corticosteroids,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to measure change in quality of life (QoL) and estimate health-related utility in adults with moderate and severe atopic dermatitis (AD) following the use of either tacrolimus ointment or topical corticosteroids. METHODS: Data were analysed from a double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing the treatment of adults with moderate and severe AD with either tacrolimus ointment or a standard corticosteroid regimen. Following randomisation, patients applied their medication twice-daily for 6 months. Monthly assessments determined response and QoL. Health-related utility (EQ5Dindex) was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation from SF-12 responses via a published mapping algorithm. RESULTS: At baseline, estimated utility data were available for 926 (95%) of the intention-to-treat patients, 57% of whom had AD of moderate severity (43% severe). The mean age at baseline was 32.5 years (SD +/- 11.8), 46.2% were male, with a mean EQ5Dindex for moderate cases of 0.770 (SD +/- 0.157), and 0.665 (SD +/- 0.225) for those with severe disease (P < 0.001). Patients treated with tacrolimus ointment showed significantly greater improvement in all but one domain of the SF-36. At baseline, there was no difference in estimated utility between the two groups; however, a difference in utility in favour of tacrolimus ointment emerged after 1 month's treatment (0.849 vs. 0.820; P = 0.004). Over the 6-month study period, the mean, marginal utility difference between the study arms was 0.032 U (utility) in favour of tacrolimus (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Treatment with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment rather than a standard topical corticosteroid ointment regimen was associated with clinically significant, incremental improvement in QoL, sustained over a 6-month period.

6957,Cost-effectiveness of treatment and endoscopic surveillance of precancerous lesions to prevent gastric cancer,"BACKGROUND: Although surveillance for Barrett esophagus and other gastrointestinal precancerous conditions is recommended, no analogous guidelines exist for gastric lesions. The objective of this study was to estimate the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of treatment and endoscopic surveillance to prevent gastric cancer. METHODS: The authors developed a state-transition decision model for a cohort of US men with a recent incidental diagnosis of gastric precancerous lesions (dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia, or atrophy). Strategies included 1) no surveillance or treatment and 2) referral for surveillance and treatment, and varied by surveillance frequency (none, every 10 years, every 5 years, or every year) and treatment modality for dysplastic and cancerous lesions (surgery or endoscopic mucosal resection [EMR]). The term ""post-treatment surveillance"" was restricted to surveillance of individuals after treatment. Data were based on published literature and databases. Outcomes included lifetime gastric cancer risk, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: For a cohort of men with dysplasia aged 50 years, the lifetime gastric cancer risk was 5.9%. EMR with annual surveillance reduced the lifetime cancer risk by 90% and cost $39,800 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Addition of post-treatment surveillance every 10 years provided little incremental benefit ( approximately 5%) but cost >$1 million per QALY. Results were most sensitive to surgical risks and the proportion of lesions completely removed with EMR.

EMR with annual surveillance reduced the lifetime cancer risk by 90% and cost $39,800 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Addition of post-treatment surveillance every 10 years provided little incremental benefit ( approximately 5%) but cost >$1 million per QALY. Results were most sensitive to surgical risks and the proportion of lesions completely removed with EMR. For intestinal metaplasia, surveillance every 10 years reduced lifetime cancer risk by 61% and cost $544,500 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: EMR with surveillance every 1 to 5 years for gastric dysplasia was promising for secondary cancer prevention and had a cost-effectiveness ratio that would be considered attractive in the United States.

6963,"Cost-Effectiveness of the Addition of Rituximab to CHOP Chemotherapy in First-Line Treatment for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma in a Population-Based Observational Cohort in British Columbia, Canada","ABSTRACT Background: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has primarily been treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and predisone (CHOP) chemotherapy since the 1970s. Recently, the addition of rituximab to CHOP (CHOP-R) has been found to improve survival and trial-based results have suggested that it is a cost-effective alternative to CHOP. Objectives: The objective in this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CHOP-R relative to CHOP in first-line treatment of DLBCL in a population-based setting in British Columbia, Canada. Methods: We created a patient-level simulation model describing potential pathways for DLBCL patients initiating treatment with either CHOP or CHOP-R. Model parameters were populated with statistical analyses of individual-level treatment and effectiveness data and published cost estimates. All results were stratified by age at treatment initiation (<60 years vs. >/=60 years). The base-case scenario was based on a 15-year time horizon and a 3% discount rate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. All costs are reported as 2006 $CDN. Results: For the base-case scenario, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for younger individuals ranged from $11,965 per disease-free life-year gained to $19,144 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. For older individuals, estimated ICERs for all health outcomes were below $10,000 per unit outcome gained for a 15-year time horizon. Conclusions: Using population-based data, CHOP-R was found to be a cost-effective alternative to CHOP, particularly for individuals aged 60 years and older.

6965,How Do Cost-Effectiveness Analyses Inform Reimbursement Decisions for Oncology Medicines in Canada? The Example of Sunitinib for First-Line Treatment of Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma,"ABSTRACT Background: Canadian oncology decision-makers have reimbursed cancer drugs at incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) higher than those considered acceptable in other therapeutic areas. Sunitinib is a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, indicated for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma (MRCC) of clear cell histology. Canadian decision-makers evaluated sunitinib funding in the presence of important data limitations (including interim analysis of a surrogate outcome) and in the context of a high ICER. Methods: First, a description was presented of the cost-effectiveness analysis submitted for sunitinib reimbursement decision-making in Canada before conclusive survival evidence had been available. Second, sunitinib access decisions and the oncology drug reimbursement literature were reviewed to explore the interpretation of sunitinib perceived value in the context of the decision-making framework in Canada. Results: The economic evaluation yielded an ICER of $144K/quality-adjusted life-year gained for sunitinib compared with interferon-alfa. This high ratio was not an insurmountable barrier to access in Canada because all provinces now reimburse sunitinib for first-line treatment of MRCC. In this particular instance, payers were receptive to immature survival data but substantial progression-free gains, for patients with a relatively rare cancer and few treatment options. Conclusion: This demonstrates that the cost-effectiveness ratio is only one of many factors that affect an access decision in oncology.",2010-01-06470,20561332,Value Health,Isabelle Chabot,2010,/,,Yes,20561332,"Isabelle Chabot; How Do Cost-Effectiveness Analyses Inform Reimbursement Decisions for Oncology Medicines in Canada?

6966,Projected Cost-Effectiveness of Ezetimibe/Simvastatin Compared with Doubling the Statin Dose in the United Kingdom: Findings from the INFORCE Study,"ABSTRACT Objective: To evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin (Eze/Simva) compared with doubling the submaximal statin doses, in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) events in the INFORCE study. Methods: Lifetime treatment costs and benefits were computed using a Markov model. Model inputs included each patient's cardiovascular risk factor profile and actual lipid values at baseline and 12 weeks (endpoint). Cardiovascular event and drug costs were discounted at 3.5%. Age-specific utilities were based on UK literature values and non-coronary heart disease mortality rates on the Office of National Statistics data. In the INFORCE study, 384 patients taking statins at stable doses for >/=6 weeks before hospital admission were stratified by statin dose/potency (low, medium, and high) and then randomized to doubling the statin dose or switching to Eze/Simva 10/40 mg for 12 weeks. Results: The Eze/Simva group (n = 195) had a higher mean baseline total cholesterol than the double-statin group (n = 189). Analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics. In the INFORCE study, Eze/Simva reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by approximately 30% (vs. 4% with doubling statin doses) and significantly enhanced LDL-C goal attainment. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, Eze/Simva conferred 0.218 incremental discounted quality-adjusted life year (QALY) at a discounted incremental cost of pound2524, for an ICER of pound11,571/QALY (95% confidence interval = pound8181- pound18,600/QALY). The ICER was pound13,552/QALY, pound11,930/QALY, and pound10,148/QALY in the low-, medium-, and high-potency strata, respectively.

6967,The Cost-Effectiveness of Spinal Cord Stimulation for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome,"ABSTRACT Objectives: Health-care policymakers and payers require cost-effectiveness evidence to inform their treatment funding decisions. The aims of this study were to assess the cost-effectiveness of the addition of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) compared with conventional management alone (CMM) in patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and to determine the cost-effectiveness of nonrechargeable versus rechargeable SCS implanted pulse generators (IPGs). Methods: A decision analytic model was used to synthesize data on CRPS patient outcomes and health-care costs over a 15-year time horizon from the perspective of the UK National Health Services. Data were sourced from two SCS randomized controlled trials. Results are expressed as an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in 2008 GBP. Results: The incremental cost-effectiveness of SCS compared with CMM was pound3562 per QALY, a finding that was robust across sensitivity analyses with an 87% probability that SCS is cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of pound30,000. When the longevity of an IPG is 4 years or less, a rechargeable (and initially more expensive) IPG is more cost-effective than a nonrechargeable IPG. Conclusions: In selected patients with CRPS, SCS is cost-effective as an adjunct to CMM. Despite their initial increased expense, rechargeable IPGs should be considered when IPG longevity is likely to be short. These findings support policymakers to extend the use of SCS as a good value for money treatment for CRPS.",2010-01-06473,20561326,Value Health,Marius A Kemler,2010,/,,Yes,20561326,"Marius A Kemler; The Cost-Effectiveness of Spinal Cord Stimulation for Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, Value Health, 2010-Jun-07; ():1098-3015",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Spinal cord stimulation vs. Conventional management,Not Stated,65 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.50,3.50,3562,United Kingdom,2008,7940.52

We applied a decision-analytic approach to assess the benefit of various strategies for functional MRI (fMRI) studies using intracranial aneurysms (IA) as a model. Methods: A decision tree and Markov model were created to simulate the impact on the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of four different strategies for review of scans for the presence of IA. To populate the decision model, we used current evidence from the literature and results from a survey of experts. Results: Review of the anatomical scans by a nonspecialist is not cost-effective in any of the subgroups of participants. Full clinical examination of women with a positive family history before enrollment in a study is cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness of reviewing scans obtained from women without a family history and men with a positive family history of IA depends on the willingness-to-pay (lambda) for a QALY: at lambda of $50,000/QALY, review of scans by a specialist is cost-effective, whereas at lambda of $100,000/QALY, a full clinical workup is the best option.

DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis based on a decision-analytic model comparing relevant strategies and life-long outcomes for mother and infant(s). SETTING: Ontario, Canada. POPULATION: A cohort of pregnant women in 1 year. METHODS: We constructed a decision-analytic model to estimate the lifetime incremental costs and benefits of screening for vasa praevia. Inputs were estimated from the literature. Costs were collected from the London Health Sciences Centre, the Ontario Health Insurance Program, and other sources. We used one-way, scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of the results. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Universal transvaginal ultrasound screening of twin pregnancies has an ICER of $5488 per QALY-gained. Screening all singleton pregnancies with the risk factors low-lying placentas, in vitro fertilisation (IVF) conception, accessory placental lobes, or velamentous cord insertion has an ICER of $15,764 per QALY-gained even though identifying some of these risk factors requires routine use of colour Doppler during transabdominal examinations. Screening women with a marginal cord insertion costs an additional $27,603 per QALY-gained. Universal transvaginal screening for vasa praevia in singleton pregnancies costs $579,164 per QALY compared with targeted screening. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with current practice, screening all twin pregnancies for vasa praevia with transvaginal ultrasound is cost-effective.

6973,"Comparison of the metabolic and economic consequences of long-term treatment of schizophrenia using ziprasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone in Canada: a cost-effectiveness analysis","Abstract Rationale, aims and objectives Second-generation antipsychotic agents have varying propensities to cause weight gain, elevated lipid levels and associated long-term complications. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of four second-generation antipsychotic agents used in Canada for the treatment of schizophrenia (ziprasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone) with a focus on their long-term metabolic consequences. Method Using data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness Study, a semi-Markov model was developed to predict the incidence and associated costs of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular complications (e.g. angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular disease death), and acute psychiatric hospitalizations in patients with chronic schizophrenia treated over 5 years. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were calculated from the perspective of the Canadian provincial ministries of health. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results The total average cost of treatment with ziprasidone was $25 301 versus $28 563 with olanzapine, $26 233 with quetiapine and $21 831 with risperidone. Ziprasidone had the lowest predicted number of type 2 diabetes cases and cardiovascular disease events, and the highest QALY gains. Patients receiving quetiapine had the highest predicted number of hospitalizations. Ziprasidone was less costly and resulted in more QALYs compared with olanzapine and quetiapine. Compared with risperidone, ziprasidone was more costly and had higher QALYs, with an incremental cost per QALY gained of $218 060. Conclusion Compared with olanzapine and quetiapine, ziprasidone produced savings to the health care system.

6975,"Comparison of the metabolic and economic consequences of long-term treatment of schizophrenia using ziprasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone in Canada: a cost-effectiveness analysis","Abstract Rationale, aims and objectives Second-generation antipsychotic agents have varying propensities to cause weight gain, elevated lipid levels and associated long-term complications. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of four second-generation antipsychotic agents used in Canada for the treatment of schizophrenia (ziprasidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone) with a focus on their long-term metabolic consequences. Method Using data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness Study, a semi-Markov model was developed to predict the incidence and associated costs of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular complications (e.g. angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular disease death), and acute psychiatric hospitalizations in patients with chronic schizophrenia treated over 5 years. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained were calculated from the perspective of the Canadian provincial ministries of health. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results The total average cost of treatment with ziprasidone was $25 301 versus $28 563 with olanzapine, $26 233 with quetiapine and $21 831 with risperidone. Ziprasidone had the lowest predicted number of type 2 diabetes cases and cardiovascular disease events, and the highest QALY gains. Patients receiving quetiapine had the highest predicted number of hospitalizations. Ziprasidone was less costly and resulted in more QALYs compared with olanzapine and quetiapine. Compared with risperidone, ziprasidone was more costly and had higher QALYs, with an incremental cost per QALY gained of $218 060. Conclusion Compared with olanzapine and quetiapine, ziprasidone produced savings to the health care system.

6976,Cost-effectiveness of routine and low-cost CD4 T-cell count compared with WHO clinical staging of HIV to guide initiation of antiretroviral therapy in resource-limited settings,"BACKGROUND:: HIV is a major cause of disease and death in sub-Saharan Africa. Provision and scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in resource-limited settings is feasible and cost-effective. Initiation of ART is guided by WHO stage or CD4 cell count; the latter may not be available and up to 70% of eligible individuals are not identified. Low-cost CD4 cell count tests are comparable to conventional methods. We compared the direct healthcare costs and benefits using routine and low-cost CD4 cell count versus WHO staging to initiate ART. METHODS:: Using a Markov state transition model, we incorporated costs, survival and quality of life. We compared the direct healthcare costs and benefits in quality-adjusted life years gained using routine and low-cost CD4 cell count versus WHO staging to initiate ART. We estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in US$ per quality-adjusted life year gained and compared with threshold of gross domestic product per capita. Uncertainty was assessed by sensitivity analysis. RESULTS:: Routine and low-cost CD4 cell counts compared to WHO staging to guide initiation of ART improved quantity and quality of life and appears to be very cost-effective. The base case estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$939 and US$85 per quality-adjusted life years gained, respectively, and well below the cost effectiveness thresholds of gross domestic product per capita.

6978,Cost-Effectiveness of CT Perfusion for Selecting Patients for Intravenous Thrombolysis: A US Hospital Perspective,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Improved selection of patients with stroke for IV tPA treatment may enhance clinical outcomes. Given the limited availability of MR imaging in hospitals, we examined the cost-effectiveness of adding CTP to the usual CT-based methods for selecting patients on the basis of the presence and extent of penumbra. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic model estimated the costs and outcomes associated with penumbra-based CTP selection in a patient population similar to that enrolled in the IV tPA clinical trials. Model inputs were obtained from published literature, clinical trial data, standard US costing sources, and expert opinion. Cost per life-year saved and cost per QALY gained were estimated from a hospital perspective. RESULTS: Addition of penumbra-based CTP to standard unenhanced CT improved favorable outcome (mRS, </=1) by 0.59% and reduced cost by $42 compared with selection based on unenhanced CT alone. Life-years and QALYs improved. Multivariate sensitivity analysis predicted cost-effectiveness (</=$50,000 per QALY) in 89.2% of simulation runs. CONCLUSIONS: Using penumbra-based CTP after routine CT to select patients with ischemic stroke for IV tPA is cost-effective compared with the usual CT-based methods for hospitals. With the ease of access of CTP, penumbra-based selection methods may be readily available to hospitals. Thus, this economic analysis may lend further support to the consideration of a paradigm shift in acute stroke evaluation.",2010-01-06490,20538823,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,Dan Jackson,2010,/,,No,20538823,"Dan Jackson; Cost-Effectiveness of CT Perfusion for Selecting Patients for Intravenous Thrombolysis: A US Hospital Perspective, AJNR Am J Neuroradiol, 2010-Jun-10; ():0195-6108",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Unenhanced CT scans, patient history, brain imaging via perfusion CT (CTP) treatment with IV tPA within 6 hours from onset of stroke symptoms vs. Usual care consisted of unenhanced CT scans alone, patient history, treatment with IV tPA within 3-4.5 hours from onset of stroke symptoms",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-167999.98,United States,2008,-201949.09
6979,Cost-effectiveness of bazedoxifene incorporating the FRAX(R) algorithm in a European perspective,"The cost-effectiveness of bazedoxifene was compared to placebo in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK from a healthcare perspective using FRAX(R) for both fracture risks and for treatment efficacy. Cost/QALY differences were explained to a large extent by differences in fracture risk. INTRODUCTION: In cost-effectiveness modelling of osteoporosis treatments, the fracture risk has traditionally been calculated with risk adjustments based on age, bone mineral density and prior fracture. However, knowledge of additional clinical risk factors contributes to fracture risk assessment as demonstrated by the FRAX(R) tool. Bazedoxifene, a new selective estrogen receptor modulator for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, has been shown in a phase III clinical trial to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures in women. In an analysis using FRAX(R), the efficacy of bazedoxifene was greater in patients with higher fracture risk. METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bazedoxifene compared to placebo in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the UK from a healthcare perspective using FRAX(R). A Markov cohort model was adapted to incorporate the FRAX(R) risk factors. FRAX(R) produces relative risks for hip fractures and major osteoporotic fractures. Patients were given a 5-year intervention, reducing the risk of fractures in a risk-dependent manner. The effect of treatment on fractures was assumed to decline linearly over 5 years after the intervention. RESULTS: There are large cost/quality-adjusted life year variations between countries in the European setting studied. The base case values ranged from cost saving (Sweden) to EUR 105,450 (Spain) in 70-year-old women with a T-score of -2.5 SD and a prior fracture. CONCLUSION: Bazedoxifene can be a cost-effective treatment for postmenopausal osteoporosis.

DESIGN: Economic evaluation comparing PCV-7, PCV-10, and PCV-13 with no vaccination using a decision tree analytic model built from data in previous studies. SETTING: The Netherlands. Population A cohort of 180,000 newborns followed until 5 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs; gains in life years and quality adjusted life years (QALYs); and incremental cost effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Under base case assumptions-that is, assuming a five year protective period of the vaccine and no assumed net indirect effects (herd protection minus serotype replacement) among children aged over 5 years-vaccination with PVC-7 in a four dose (3+1) schedule was estimated to prevent 71 and 5778 cases of invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal disease, respectively, in children aged up to 5 years. This corresponds with a total net gain of 173 life years or 277 QALYs. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of PCV-7 was estimated at euro113,891 ( pound98,300; $145,000) per QALY, well over the ratio of euro50,000 per QALY required for PCV-7 to be regarded as potentially cost effective. A three dose (2+1) schedule of PCV-7 reduced the incremental cost effectiveness ratio to euro82,975 per QALY. For various assumptions and including 10% of the maximum net indirect effects among individuals aged 5 years and over, PCV-10 and PCV-13 had incremental cost effectiveness ratios ranging from euro31,250 to euro52,947 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The current Dutch infant vaccination programme of four doses of PCV-7 is not cost effective because of increases in invasive disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes, which reduces the overall direct effects of vaccination and offsets potential positive herd protection benefits in unvaccinated individuals. The 10 valent and 13 valent pneumococcal vaccines could have better net health benefits than PCV-7 through less replacement disease and increased herd protection. Both these effects could substantially reduce the incremental cost effectiveness ratio to possibly acceptable levels, if total programme costs can be lowered by reduced schedules, reductions in vaccine prices, or both.",2010-01-06509,20519267,BMJ,Mark H Rozenbaum,2010,340 /,c2509,No,20519267,"Mark H Rozenbaum; Cost effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination among Dutch infants: economic analysis of the seven valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine and forecast for the 10 valent and 13 valent vaccines, BMJ, 2010; 340():0959-8138; c2509",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Thirteen valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV-13) in a four dose schedule (3+1) vs. No vaccine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,4.00,1.50,91703.03,Euro,2008,162326.46

CONCLUSIONS: The current Dutch infant vaccination programme of four doses of PCV-7 is not cost effective because of increases in invasive disease caused by non-vaccine serotypes, which reduces the overall direct effects of vaccination and offsets potential positive herd protection benefits in unvaccinated individuals. The 10 valent and 13 valent pneumococcal vaccines could have better net health benefits than PCV-7 through less replacement disease and increased herd protection.

6987,Cost effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination among Dutch infants: economic analysis of the seven valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine and forecast for the 10 valent and 13 valent vaccines,"OBJECTIVES: To update cost effectiveness estimates for the four dose (3+1) schedule of the seven valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (PCV-7) in the Netherlands and to explore the impact on cost effectiveness of reduced dose schedules and implementation of 10 valent and 13 valent pneumococcal vaccines (PCV-10 and PCV-13). DESIGN: Economic evaluation comparing PCV-7, PCV-10, and PCV-13 with no vaccination using a decision tree analytic model built from data in previous studies. SETTING: The Netherlands. Population A cohort of 180,000 newborns followed until 5 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs; gains in life years and quality adjusted life years (QALYs); and incremental cost effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Under base case assumptions-that is, assuming a five year protective period of the vaccine and no assumed net indirect effects (herd protection minus serotype replacement) among children aged over 5 years-vaccination with PVC-7 in a four dose (3+1) schedule was estimated to prevent 71 and 5778 cases of invasive and non-invasive pneumococcal disease, respectively, in children aged up to 5 years. This corresponds with a total net gain of 173 life years or 277 QALYs. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of PCV-7 was estimated at euro113,891 ( pound98,300; $145,000) per QALY, well over the ratio of euro50,000 per QALY required for PCV-7 to be regarded as potentially cost effective. A three dose (2+1) schedule of PCV-7 reduced the incremental cost effectiveness ratio to euro82,975 per QALY. For various assumptions and including 10% of the maximum net indirect effects among individuals aged 5 years and over, PCV-10 and PCV-13 had incremental cost effectiveness ratios ranging from euro31,250 to euro52,947 per QALY.

The objective of this study was to determine the most cost-effective timing for pegylated interferon/ribavirin therapy in patients with advanced liver disease infected with genotype 1 HCV. A Markov model was constructed to compare treatment strategies: (1) no treatment, (2) antiviral therapy in patients with compensated cirrhosis, (3) antiviral therapy in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, and (4) antiviral therapy in patients with progressive fibrosis due to recurrent HCV post-transplantation. Outcomes of interest included the total cost per patient, number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved, cost per QALY saved, number of deaths and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), and number of transplants required. Compared to the no-antiviral treatment strategy, treatment during compensated cirrhosis increased QALYs by 0.950 and saved $55,314. Treatment during decompensated cirrhosis increased QALYs by 0.044 and saved $5511. Treatment during posttransplant advanced recurrence increased QALYs by 0.061 and saved $3223.

6991,Cost-effectiveness of a pressure ulcer quality collaborative,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: A quality improvement collaborative (QIC) in the Dutch long-term care sector (nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home care) used evidence-based prevention methods to reduce the incidence and prevalence of pressure ulcers (PUs). The collaborative consisted of a core team of experts and 25 organizational project teams. Our aim was to determine its cost-effectiveness from a healthcare perspective. METHODS: We used a non-controlled pre-post design to establish the change in incidence and prevalence of PUs in 88 patients over the course of a year. Staff indexed data and prevention methods (activities, materials). Quality of life (Qol) weights were assigned to the PU states. We assessed the costs of activities and materials in the project. A Markov model was built based on effectiveness and cost data, complemented with a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. To illustrate the results of longer term, three scenarios were created in which change in incidence and prevalence measures were (1) not sustained, (2) partially sustained, and (3) completely sustained. RESULTS: Incidence of PUs decreased from 15% to 4.5% for the 88 patients. Prevalence decreased from 38.6% to 22.7%. Average Quality of Life (Qol) of patients increased by 0.02 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY)s in two years; healthcare costs increased by euro2000 per patient; the Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio (ICER) was between 78,500 and 131,000 depending on whether the changes in incidence and prevalence of PU were sustained. CONCLUSIONS: During the QIC PU incidence and prevalence significantly declined. When compared to standard PU care, the QIC was probably more costly and more effective in the short run, but its long-term cost-effectiveness is questionable. The QIC can only be cost-effective if the changes in incidence and prevalence of PU are sustained.",2010-01-06515,20515473,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Peter Makai,2010,8 /,11,Yes,20515473,"Peter Makai; Cost-effectiveness of a pressure ulcer quality collaborative, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2010; 8():1478-7547; 11",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pressure ulcer collaborative quality improvement collaborative vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,4.00,1.50,100000,Euro,2006,161280.95
6992,Cost-effectiveness of guided self-help treatment for recurrent binge eating,"OBJECTIVE: Adoption of effective treatments for recurrent binge-eating disorders depends on the balance of costs and benefits. Using data from a recent randomized controlled trial, we conducted an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of a cognitive-behavioral therapy guided self-help intervention (CBT-GSH) to treat recurrent binge eating compared to treatment as usual (TAU). METHOD: Participants were 123 adult members of an HMO (mean age = 37.2 years, 91.9% female, 96.7% non-Hispanic White) who met criteria for eating disorders involving binge eating as measured by the Eating Disorder Examination (C. G. Fairburn & Z. Cooper, 1993). Participants were randomized either to treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU plus CBT-GSH. The clinical outcomes were binge-free days and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); total societal cost was estimated using costs to patients and the health plan and related costs. RESULTS: Compared to those receiving TAU only, those who received TAU plus CBT-GSH experienced 25.2 more binge-free days and had lower total societal costs of $427 over 12 months following the intervention (incremental CEA ratio of -$20.23 per binge-free day or -$26,847 per QALY). Lower costs in the TAU plus CBT-GSH group were due to reduced use of TAU services in that group, resulting in lower net costs for the TAU plus CBT group despite the additional cost of CBT-GSH.

6993,Modelling lifetime QALYs and health care costs from different drinking patterns over time: a Markov model,"The negative health consequences of alcohol use and its treatment account for significant health care expenditure worldwide. Long-term modelling techniques are developed in this paper to establish a link between drinking patterns, health consequences and alcohol treatment effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The overall change in health related quality and quantity of life which results from changes in health-related behaviour is estimated. Specifically, a probabilistic lifetime Markov model is presented where alcohol consumption in grams of alcohol per day and drinking history are used for the categorization of patients into four Markov states. Utility weights are assigned to each drinking state using EQ-5D scores. Mortality and morbidity estimates are state, gender and age specific, and are alcohol-related and non-alcohol-related. The methodology is tested in a case study. This represents a major development in the techniques traditionally used in alcohol economic models, in which short-term costs and outcomes are assessed, omitting potential longer term cost savings and improvements in health related quality of life.

6994,Cost effectiveness of memantine in Alzheimer's disease in the UK,"Objective: This analysis assesses the cost-effectiveness of memantine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the UK. Methods: This cost-utility analysis was based on a Markov model. The model simulated 5-year progress of patients with AD until they need full-time care (FTC), defined as a patient becoming either dependent or institutionalised. Transition probabilities were based on a predictive equation, derived from the London and South-East Region epidemiological study. Resource use, utilities and mortality were obtained from the same study. Memantine efficacy was based on a meta-analysis of six large trials. The model compared memantine to its alternative in the UK, i.e. no pharmacological treatment or background therapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Results: Memantine was found to delay the need to FTC by 6 weeks compared with current practice in the UK. It was associated with increased quality-adjusted life-years and cost savings to the healthcare system (probability of this outcome was 96%). The projections were made assuming that benefits from the 6-month treatment were sustained over time, which is regarded as the main limitation. The model underwent extensive sensitivity analyses, which confirmed the base-case findings. Conclusions: The model suggests that memantine delays the need for FTC and decreases cost.

6995,Cost effectiveness of prophylactic HPV 16/18 vaccination in Finland: results from a modelling exercise,"Objectives: the study aims to estimate the clinical-impact and cost-effectiveness value of adding human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccination against cervical cancer among women currently undergoing organised screening in Finland. Methods: A Markov cohort model evaluating high-risk HPV infections and cervical cancer (CC) cases combined with screening has been customised to the Finnish setting. The model outcome for a cohort of 30,000 girls aged 10 years was calibrated to age-specific annual number of Pap smears, CC incidence and mortality. Results: The observed age-specific incidence and mortality rates of CC closely match the data replicated by the model. The model predicts that with a 90% vaccine coverage rate, CC cases and mortality would be reduced by 70%. In the base-case analysis with a discount rate of 3% the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) gained, from a healthcare perspective, was euro17,294. Without discounting this value is euro2,591/QALY gained. Conclusions: The analysis suggests that implementing prophylactic CC vaccination within the current screening system would substantially reduce CC cases and deaths, as well as the overall disease burden expressed in pre-cancer lesions averted. Vaccination could be a cost-effective intervention in Finland despite the fact that the number of CC cases and deaths are currently relatively low.

6996,Long-term benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysms from a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The aim was to estimate long-term mortality benefits and cost-effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men aged 64-73 years. METHODS: All men aged 64-73 years living in Viborg County were randomized to be controls (n = 6306) or invited for abdominal ultrasonography at a regional hospital (n = 6333). Mortality and AAA-related interventions were recorded in national databases. The cost of initial screening was based on actual costs of the programme. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated on gains in life years and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY). Discounting (3 per cent) was applied to both costs and effects, and all costs were adjusted to euros at 2007 prices. RESULTS: The relative risk reduction of the screening programme in AAA-related mortality was 66 per cent (hazard ratio 0.34, 95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 0.20 to 0.57). The corresponding risk reduction in all-cause mortality was 2 per cent (hazard ratio 0.98, 95 per cent c.i. 0.93 to 1.03). The ICER was estimated at euro157 (-3292 to 4401) per life year gained and euro179 (-4083 to 4682) per QALY gained. Screening was found to be cost effective at a probability above 0.97 for a willingness-to-pay threshold of only euro5000. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this result was robust to various alternative assumptions, as the probability did not drop below 0.90 for any scenario.

6997,"Economic impact of the advent of posterior lamellar keratoplasty in Montreal, Quebec","Objective: To assess the cost-utility of posterior lamellar keratoplasty (PLK) techniques, including deep lamellar endothelial keratoplasty, Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty, and Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty, in the treatment of corneal endothelial diseases.Design: Cost-utility analysis based on a Markov model.Participants: Cohort of 100 patients waiting for corneal graft.Methods: This cost-utility analysis was performed from a Canadian health system perspective over a lifetime period. A Markov model was constructed to compare the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) associated with penetrating keratoplasty (PK) and PLK techniques. The model included all major health states relevant to patients scheduled for corneal transplant: waiting for transplant, surviving graft with or without complications, irreversible failure, noneligibility, and death. Transition probabilities among health states were obtained from published clinical trials. Costs considered were those associated with surgery, patients' follow-up, and postsurgical complications. Number of QALYs was estimated presurgery and postsurgery using the Brown and Sharma conversion chart.Results: PLK proved to be more effective, providing more QALYs (+13 QALYs/100 patients), and it was less costly (-$68 792/100 patients) compared with PK.

6998,Universal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance for adults at hospital admission: an economic model and analysis,"BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) transmission and infections are a continuing problem in hospitals. Although some have recommended universal surveillance for MRSA at hospital admission to identify and to isolate MRSA-colonized patients, there is a need for formal economic studies to determine the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy. METHODS: We developed a stochastic computer simulation model to determine the potential economic impact of performing MRSA surveillance (ie, single culture of an anterior nares specimen) for all hospital admissions at different MRSA prevalences and basic reproductive rate thresholds from the societal and third party-payor perspectives. Patients with positive surveillance culture results were placed under isolation precautions to prevent transmission by way of respiratory droplets. MRSA-colonized patients who were not isolated could transmit MRSA to other hospital patients. RESULTS: The performance of universal MRSA surveillance was cost-effective (defined as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year) when the basic reproductive rate was 0.25 or greater and the prevalence was 1% or greater. In fact, surveillance was the dominant strategy when the basic reproductive rate was 1.5 or greater and the prevalence was 15% or greater, the basic reproductive rate was 2.0 or greater and the prevalence was 10% or greater, and the basic reproductive rate was 2.5 or greater and the prevalence was 5% or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Universal MRSA surveillance of adults at hospital admission appears to be cost-effective at a wide range of prevalence and basic reproductive rate values. Individual hospitals and healthcare systems could compare their prevailing conditions (eg, the prevalence of MRSA colonization and MRSA transmission dynamics) with the benchmarks in our model to help determine their optimal local strategies.",2010-01-06529,20402588,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Bruce Y Lee,2010,31 / 6,598-606,No,20402588,"Bruce Y Lee; Universal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance for adults at hospital admission: an economic model and analysis, Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol, 2010-Jun; 31(6):0899-823X; 598-606",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) surveillance vs. Usual Care; no methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) Surveillance,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2008,Not Stated

Objective: The aim of this work was to compare ranibizumab with best supportive care or photodynamic therapy (PDT) for AMD by means of economic costutility and cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of Germany's Statutory Health Insurance System. Methods: Visual acuity data from the Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic Choroidal Neovascularization in AMD (ANCHOR) and Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-VEGF Antibody Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Neovascular AMD (MARINA) studies were applied, based on a ranibizumab dose of 0.5 mg. A Markov model simulated visual acuity and costs over 10 years (discounted at 3%). The base-case analysis assumed 5 injections per year over 2 years. Treatment costs were based on year-2008 euros (using German prices) and recommendations for procedure reimbursement from a public health insurance perspective. To assess cost-effectiveness, costs per year of legal blindness avoided (ie, vision-year gained [VYG]) and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were calculated. The model assumed each patient's affected eye had better sight than the other eye, and the 2 comparators against which ranibizumab treatment was assessed were best supportive care and PDT. The robustness of the results was investigated in a univariate sensitivity analysis of all relevant parameters and a multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The multivariate 95% CIs for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were obtained by conducting 1000 Monte Carlo simulations. Results: Compared with best supportive care, costs per VYG for ranibizumab were euro6767 in occult choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and euro6020 in minimally classic CNV. In classic CNV, costs were euro5734/VYG for ranibizumab compared with supportive care and euro778/VYG for ranibizumab compared with PDT. Costs per QALY for ranibizumab treatment for occult, minimally classic CNV, and classic CNV were euro22,320, euro22,538, and euro25,036, respectively, and euro3294 for classic CNV compared with PDT. Results were sensitive to the cost of blindness, injection frequency, and duration. The multivariate 95% CIs for the incremental costeffectiveness ratios were euro14,438 to euro41,110/QALY for occult CNV, euro13,463 to euro43,614/QALY for minimally classic CNV, and euro15,634 to euro51,106/QALY for classic CNV.

7000,Cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration in germany: Model analysis from the perspective of germany's statutory health insurance system,"Background: In clinical trials, ranibizumab has been associated with stabilization and even improvement of visual acuity among patients with neovascular agerelated macular degeneration (AMD), but its use is also associated with considerable costs. Objective: The aim of this work was to compare ranibizumab with best supportive care or photodynamic therapy (PDT) for AMD by means of economic costutility and cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of Germany's Statutory Health Insurance System. Methods: Visual acuity data from the Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) Antibody for the Treatment of Predominantly Classic Choroidal Neovascularization in AMD (ANCHOR) and Minimally Classic/Occult Trial of the Anti-VEGF Antibody Ranibizumab in the Treatment of Neovascular AMD (MARINA) studies were applied, based on a ranibizumab dose of 0.5 mg. A Markov model simulated visual acuity and costs over 10 years (discounted at 3%). The base-case analysis assumed 5 injections per year over 2 years. Treatment costs were based on year-2008 euros (using German prices) and recommendations for procedure reimbursement from a public health insurance perspective.
