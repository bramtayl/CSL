17901,Cost-Effectiveness of Golimumab in Ankylosing Spondylitis from the UK Payer Perspective,"INTRODUCTION: Golimumab is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor for treatment of patients with severe, active ankylosing spondylitis. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of golimumab compared with conventional care and other TNF-alpha inhibitors in treatment of AS from the UK National Health Service perspective. METHODS: A long-term Markov model (with initial decision tree) was developed to simulate the progression of a hypothetical cohort of patients with active AS over a lifetime. The effectiveness outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Utilities were estimated by mapping Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index scores, and the primary response measure was >/=50% improvement on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index at 12 weeks. Direct, medication, and AS management costs were included. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: All TNF-alpha inhibitors were comparable to each other and superior to conventional care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for TNF-alpha inhibitors were pound19,070-42,532 per QALY gained compared with conventional care. Analyses of the ICERs for each TNF-alpha inhibitor compared with conventional care demonstrated that golimumab was the most cost-effective treatment, and that adalimumab and etanercept were dominated by golimumab. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Golimumab may be considered a cost-effective treatment alternative for patients with active AS. With comparable costs and efficacy among TNF-alpha inhibitors, the choice of TNF-alpha inhibitor to treat AS is likely to be driven by patient and physician choice.

17905,Cost-Utility Analysis of Lipegfilgrastim Compared to Pegfilgrastim for the Prophylaxis of Chemotherapy-Induced Neutropenia in Patients with Stage II-IV Breast Cancer,"Background: Lipegfilgrastim (Lonquex(R)) has demonstrated to be non-inferior to pegfilgrastim (Neulasta(R)) in reducing the duration of severe neutropenia (SN) in patients with stage II-IV breast cancer. Compared to pegfilgrastim, lipegfilgrastim also demonstrated statistically significant lower time to ANC recovery in cycles 1-3, lower incidence of SN in cycle 2 and lower depth of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir in cycles 2 and 3. The aim of this study was to quantify the cost utility of lipegfilgrastim compared to pegfilgrastim in stage II-IV breast cancer patients, taking the perspective of the Belgian payer over a lifetime horizon. Methods: Two Markov models were developed to track on- and post-chemotherapy related complications, including SN, febrile neutropenia (FN), chemotherapy dose delay, chemotherapy relative dose intensity of less than 85%, infection, death rates, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data on costs (2015 value) and effects were obtained from literature, national references, and complemented by a survey of clinical experts using a modified Delphi method. Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out. Outcomes measures included costs, QALYs and life-years (LY). Results: At current equivalent price of euro1,169, treatment with lipegfilgrastim was associated with overall costs of euro9,845 vs. euro10,208 for pegfilgrastim and overall QALYs of 13.977 vs. 13.925 for pegfilgrastim. Life expectancy was increased by 21 days (or 0.058 LY gained). The difference in costs stem from avoided infection, SN and FN cases in the lipegfilgrastim compared to the pegfilgrastim group. Similarly, the difference in QALYs was explained by the difference in the number of patients in the chemotherapy/G-CSF Markov state followed by infection and FN between lipegfilgrastim and pegfilgrastim. The probability of lipegfilgrastim to be cost-effective compared to pegfilgrastim was 68, 79, and 83% at the willingness-to-pay thresholds (WTP) of euro10,000, euro30,000 and euro50,000 per QALY gained, respectively. At a WTP threshold of euro30,000 per QALY gained, lipegfilgrastim was cost-effective up to euro1,500 across all age bands and cancer stages, compared to the current price.

17920,Cost-effectiveness of a potential group B streptococcal vaccine for pregnant women in the United States,"BACKGROUND: In the U.S., intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) for pregnant women colonized with group B streptococcus (GBS) has reduced GBS disease in the first week of life (early-onset/EOGBS). Nonetheless, GBS remains a leading cause of neonatal sepsis, including 1000 late-onset (LOGBS) cases annually. A maternal vaccine under development could prevent EOGBS and LOGBS. METHODS: Using a decision-analytic model, we compared the public health impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of five strategies to prevent GBS disease in infants: (1) no prevention; (2) currently recommended screening/IAP; (3) maternal GBS immunization; (4) maternal immunization with IAP when indicated for unimmunized women; (5) maternal immunization plus screening/IAP for all women. We modeled a pentavalent vaccine covering serotypes 1a, 1b, II, III, and V, which cause almost all GBS disease. RESULTS: In the base case, screening/IAP alone prevents 46% of EOGBS compared to no prevention, at a cost of $70,275 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) from a healthcare and $51,249/QALY from a societal perspective (2013 US$). At coverage rates typical of maternal vaccines in the U.S., a pentavalent vaccine alone would not prevent as much disease as screening/IAP until its efficacy approached 90%, but would cost less per QALY. At vaccine efficacy of >/=70%, maternal immunization together with IAP for unimmunized women would prevent more disease than screening/IAP, at a similar cost/QALY.

17925,Management of precancerous anal intraepithelial lesions in human immunodeficiency virus-positive men who have sex with men: Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are at disproportionately high risk for anal cancer. There is no definitive approach to the management of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), which are precursors of anal cancer, and evidence suggests that posttreatment adjuvant quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination improves HSIL treatment effectiveness. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the optimal HSIL management strategy with respect to clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and to identify the optimal age for initiating HSIL management. METHODS: A decision analytic model of the natural history of anal carcinoma and HSIL management strategies was constructed for HIV-positive MSM who were 27 years old or older. The model was informed by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database and published studies. Outcomes included the lifetime cost, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cumulative risk of cancer and cancer-related deaths, and cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Active monitoring was the most effective approach in patients 29 years or younger; thereafter, HSIL treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination became most effective. When cost-effectiveness was considered (ie, an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] < $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year), do nothing was cost-effective until the age of 38 years, and HSIL treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination was cost-effective beyond the age of 38 years (95% confidence interval, 34-43 years). The ICER decreased as the age at HSIL management increased. Outcomes were sensitive to the rate of HSIL regression or progression and the cost of high-resolution anoscopy and biopsy. CONCLUSIONS: The management of HSIL in HIV-positive MSM who are 38 years old or older with treatment plus adjuvant qHPV vaccination is likely to be cost-effective. The conservative approach of no treatment is likely to be cost-effective in younger patients. Cancer 2017;123:4709-4719.

17926,Management of precancerous anal intraepithelial lesions in human immunodeficiency virus-positive men who have sex with men: Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) are at disproportionately high risk for anal cancer. There is no definitive approach to the management of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), which are precursors of anal cancer, and evidence suggests that posttreatment adjuvant quadrivalent human papillomavirus (qHPV) vaccination improves HSIL treatment effectiveness. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the optimal HSIL management strategy with respect to clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and to identify the optimal age for initiating HSIL management. METHODS: A decision analytic model of the natural history of anal carcinoma and HSIL management strategies was constructed for HIV-positive MSM who were 27 years old or older. The model was informed by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database and published studies. Outcomes included the lifetime cost, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, cumulative risk of cancer and cancer-related deaths, and cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective.

17928,Aerobic exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms: A cost-utility analysis based on the Active Women trial,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-utility of two exercise interventions relative to a control group for vasomotor menopausal symptoms. DESIGN: Economic evaluation taking a UK National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective and a societal perspective. SETTING: Primary care. POPULATION: Peri- and postmenopausal women who have not used hormone therapy in the past 3 months and experience >/= 5 episodes of vasomotor symptoms daily. METHODS: An individual and a social support-based exercise intervention were evaluated. The former (Exercise-DVD), aimed to prompt exercise with purpose-designed DVD and written materials, whereas the latter (Exercise-Social support) with community exercise social support groups. Costs and outcomes associated with these interventions were compared to those of a control group, who could only have an exercise consultation. An incremental cost-utility analysis was undertaken using bootstrapping to account for the uncertainty around cost-effectiveness point-estimates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: Data for 261 women were available for analysis. Exercise-DVD was the most expensive and least effective intervention. Exercise-Social support was pound52 (CIs: pound18 to pound86) and pound18 (CIs: - pound68 to pound105) more expensive per woman than the control group at 6 and 12 months post-randomisation and led to 0.006 (CIs: -0.002 to 0.014) and 0.013 (CIs: -0.01 to 0.036) more QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound8,940 and pound1,413 per QALY gained respectively. Exercise-Social support had 80%-90% probability of being cost-effective in the UK context. A societal perspective of analysis and a complete-case analysis led to similar findings. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise-Social support resulted in a small gain in health-related quality of life at a marginal additional cost in a context where broader wellbeing and long-term gains associated with exercise and social participation were not captured.

17930,Cost-effectiveness analysis of secukinumab for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis: a Canadian perspective,"OBJECTIVE: The study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes interleukin (IL)-17A, vs currently licensed biologic treatments in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) from a Canadian healthcare system perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic semi-Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg compared to subcutaneous biologics adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and ustekinumab, and intravenous biologics infliximab and infliximab biosimilar in biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients over a lifetime horizon. The response to treatments was evaluated after 12 weeks by PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) response rates. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic treatment were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI], Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ], withdrawal rates, costs, and resource use) were collected from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). An annual discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. The robustness of the study findings were evaluated via sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Biologic-naive patients treated with secukinumab achieved the highest number of QALYs (8.54) at the lowest cost (CAD 925,387) over a lifetime horizon vs all comparators. Secukinumab dominated all treatments, except for infliximab and its biosimilar, which achieved minimally more QALYs (8.58). However, infliximab and its biosimilar incurred more costs than secukinumab (infliximab: CAD 1,015,437; infliximab biosimilar: CAD 941,004), resulting in higher cost-effectiveness estimates relative to secukinumab. In the biologic-experienced population, secukinumab dominated all treatments as it generated more QALYs (8.89) at lower costs (CAD 954,692). Deterministic sensitivity analyses indicated the results were most sensitive to variation in PsARC response rates, change in HAQ, and utility values in both populations.

METHODS: A decision analytic semi-Markov model evaluated the cost-effectiveness of secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg compared to subcutaneous biologics adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, etanercept, golimumab, and ustekinumab, and intravenous biologics infliximab and infliximab biosimilar in biologic-naive and biologic-experienced patients over a lifetime horizon. The response to treatments was evaluated after 12 weeks by PsA Response Criteria (PsARC) response rates. Non-responders or patients discontinuing initial-line of biologic treatment were allowed to switch to subsequent-line biologics. Model input parameters (Psoriasis Area Severity Index [PASI], Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ], withdrawal rates, costs, and resource use) were collected from clinical trials, published literature, and other Canadian sources. Benefits were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). An annual discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and benefits. The robustness of the study findings were evaluated via sensitivity analyses.

17944,Cost-utility analysis of direct VAD versus double bridges to heart transplantation in patients with refractory heart failure,"OBJECT: This study compared the cost-utility of direct ventricular assist device (VAD) versus double bridges, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) before VAD, to heart transplantation in patients with refractory heart failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From a health payer perspective, a Markov model was developed. The cycle length was one month and the time horizon was a lifetime. Probabilities and direct cost data were calculated from a nationwide claim database. Utility inputs were adopted from published sources. The utility was expressed as quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Both costs and utility were discounted by an annual rate of 3%. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the stability of the model. RESULTS: The direct VAD group had less life time costs (USD 95,910] v. USD 129,516) but higher life time QALYs than the double bridges group (1.73 vs. 0.89). The sensitivity analysis revealed that the direct VAD group consistently had lower cost and higher QALYs during all variations in model parameters. The probability that direct VAD was cost-effective exceeded 75% at any levels of willing-to-pay. CONCLUSION: From a health-insurance payer perspective, direct VAD bridge to heart transplantation appeared to be more cost-effective than double bridges in patients with refractory heart failure.

Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to test the stability of the model. RESULTS: The direct VAD group had less life time costs (USD 95,910] v. USD 129,516) but higher life time QALYs than the double bridges group (1.73 vs. 0.89). The sensitivity analysis revealed that the direct VAD group consistently had lower cost and higher QALYs during all variations in model parameters. The probability that direct VAD was cost-effective exceeded 75% at any levels of willing-to-pay. CONCLUSION: From a health-insurance payer perspective, direct VAD bridge to heart transplantation appeared to be more cost-effective than double bridges in patients with refractory heart failure.

17947,Comparative effectiveness of one-stage versus two-stage basilic vein transposition arteriovenous fistulas,"OBJECTIVE: Basilic vein transposition (BVT) fistulas may be performed as either a one-stage or two-stage operation, although there is debate as to which technique is superior. This study was designed to evaluate the comparative clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of one-stage vs two-stage BVT. METHODS: We identified all patients at a single large academic hospital who had undergone creation of either a one-stage or two-stage BVT between January 2007 and January 2015. Data evaluated included patient demographics, comorbidities, medication use, reasons for abandonment, and interventions performed to maintain patency. Costs were derived from the literature, and effectiveness was expressed in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We analyzed primary and secondary functional patency outcomes as well as survival during follow-up between one-stage and two-stage BVT procedures using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank tests. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was used to determine cost savings. RESULTS: We identified 131 patients in whom 57 (44%) one-stage BVT and 74 (56%) two-stage BVT fistulas were created among 8 different vascular surgeons during the study period that each performed both procedures. There was no significant difference in the mean age, male gender, white race, diabetes, coronary disease, or medication profile among patients undergoing one- vs two-stage BVT. After fistula transposition, the median follow-up time was 8.3 months (interquartile range, 3-21 months). Primary patency rates of one-stage BVT were 56% at 12-month follow-up, whereas primary patency rates of two-stage BVT were 72% at 12-month follow-up. Patients undergoing two-stage BVT also had significantly higher rates of secondary functional patency at 12 months (57% for one-stage BVT vs 80% for two-stage BVT) and 24 months (44% for one-stage BVT vs 73% for two-stage BVT) of follow-up (P < .001 using log-rank test). However, there was no significant difference between groups in use of interventions (58% for one-stage BVT vs 51% for two-stage BVT; P = .5) to maintain patency. These findings were confirmed in multivariate analysis, in which two-stage BVTs were associated with a significantly lower rate of failure (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.8; P < .05) than one-stage BVTs after controlling for confounding variables. Finally, the two-stage BVT was more cost-effective (3.74 QALYs for two-stage BVT vs 3.32 QALYs for one-stage BVT) during 5 years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $4681 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that two-stage BVTs are more durable and cost-effective than one-stage procedures, with significantly higher patency and lower rates of failure among comparable risk-stratified patients. These findings suggest that additional upfront costs and resources associated with creating two-stage BVTs are justified by their long-term outcomes.",2017-01-24610,28943003,J Vasc Surg,Amir A Ghaffarian,2017,/,,No,28943003,"Amir A Ghaffarian; Claire L Griffin; Larry W Kraiss; Mark R Sarfati; Benjamin S Brooke; Comparative effectiveness of one-stage versus two-stage basilic vein transposition arteriovenous fistulas, J Vasc Surg, 2017 Sep 21; ():0741-5214",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Two-stage basilic vein transposition vs. Standard/Usual Care- One-stage basilic vein transposition,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,757.14,United States,2016,816.46
17948,Economic Evaluation of Left Ventricular Assist Devices for Patients With End Stage Heart Failure Who Are Ineligible for Cardiac Transplantation,"BACKGROUND: Continuous flow (CF) left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) improve survival in end-stage heart failure patients who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation. Their use in this population (referred to as destination therapy) is increasing in many countries, yet they are not routinely funded for this indication in Canada. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of destination therapy CF-LVADs from the perspective of the Canadian health care payer. METHODS: A Markov model was used to project the outcomes and costs of 2 treatment pathways, CF-LVAD implantation and medical management alone, in an end-stage heart failure patient cohort ineligible for transplantation. Clinical and cost input estimates were informed from the available literature. Model outcomes included costs (in 2015 Canadian dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Compared with medical management, CF-LVAD patients had higher costs ($284,287 vs $31,984) and QALYs (1.48 vs 0.39) over a lifetime horizon. The incremental cost per QALY gained was $230,692. The model was most sensitive to device implantation costs, and the clinical effectiveness of CF-LVADs on survival and quality of life. A scenario analysis using contemporary survival data resulted in a cost per QALY gained of $125,936. When applying contemporary LVAD survival trends, the model showed that the cost of initial LVAD implantation needed to be less than $123,000 to be considered cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The incremental cost per QALY for destination therapy CF-LVADs is predicted to be above usual thresholds for funding in Canada. In some plausible scenarios, its cost-effectiveness is similar to dialysis for kidney failure, a therapy that is also immediately life-saving. Because of this, there will be likely ongoing pressure to fund CF-LVADs for a subset of patients ineligible for transplantation.",2017-01-24614,28941608,Can J Cardiol,Derek S Chew,2017,33 / 10,1283-1291,No,28941608,"Derek S Chew; Braden Manns; Robert J H Miller; Nakul Sharma; Derek V Exner; Economic Evaluation of Left Ventricular Assist Devices for Patients With End Stage Heart Failure Who Are Ineligible for Cardiac Transplantation, Can J Cardiol, 2017 Oct; 33(10):0828-282X; 1283-1291",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous flow (CF) left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Medical management,Patients with end stage heart failure who are ineligible for cardiac transplantation,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,1.50,1.50,230692,Canada,2015,197246.72
17949,Doxycycline compared with prednisolone therapy for patients with bullous pemphigoid: cost-effectiveness analysis of the BLISTER trial,"BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Doxycycline and prednisolone to treat bullous pemphigoid were compared within a randomised controlled trial (RCT). OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost-effectiveness of doxycycline-initiated and prednisolone-initiated treatment for patients with BP. METHODS: a multicentre, parallel-group, investigator-blinded RCT. Within-trial analysis used bivariate regression of costs and QALYs, with multiple imputation of missing data, informing a probabilistic assessment of incremental treatment cost-effectiveness from a health service perspective RESULTS: In the base case, there was no robust difference in costs or QALYs per patient at 1 year comparing doxycycline-initiated therapy with prednisolone-initiated therapy (net cost: pound959, 95% CI - pound24 to pound1941; net QALYs: -0.024, 95% CI -0.088 to 0.041). However, findings varied by baseline blister severity. For patients with mild or moderate blistering (</=30) net costs and outcomes were similar. For patients with severe blistering (>30) net costs were higher ( pound2558, 95% CI - pound82 to pound5198) and quality of life poorer (-0.090 QALYs, 95% CI-0.222 to 0.042) for patients starting on doxycycline. The probability that doxycycline would be cost-effective for those with severe pemphigoid was 1.5% at a willingness to pay of pound20,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the clinical findings of the BLISTER trial, patients with mild or moderate blistering should receive treatment guided by the safety and effectiveness of the drugs and patient preference - neither strategy is clearly a preferred use of NHS resources.

17952,Similar cost-utility for double- and single-bundle techniques in ACL reconstruction,"PURPOSE: The aim was to estimate the cost-utility of the DB technique (n = 53) compared with the SB (n = 50) technique 2 years after ACL reconstruction. METHODS: One hundred and five patients with an ACL injury were randomised to either the Double-bundle (DB) or the Single-bundle (SB) technique. One hundred and three patients (SBG n = 50, DBG n = 53) attended the 2-year follow-up examination. The mean age was 27.5 (8.4) years in the SBG and 30.1 (9.1) years in the DBG. The cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was used as the primary outcome. Direct costs were the cost of health care, in this case outpatient procedures. Indirect costs are costs related to reduce work ability for health reasons. The cost-utility analysis was measured in terms of QALY gained. RESULTS: The groups were comparable in terms of clinical outcome. Operating room time was statistically significantly longer in the DBG (p = 0.001), making the direct costs statistically significantly higher in the DBG (p = 0.005). There was no significant difference in QALYs between groups. In the cost-effectiveness plane, the mean difference in costs and QALYs from the trial data using 1000 bootstrap replicates in order to visualise the uncertainty associated with the mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) estimate showed that the ICERs were spread out over all quadrants. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that there was a 50% probability of the DB being cost-effective at a threshold of Euro 50,000. CONCLUSION: The principal findings are that the DB is more expensive from a health-care perspective.

17953,Cost effectiveness of an intervention focused on reducing bathing disability,"The onset of bathing disability among older people is critical for a decline in functioning and has implications for both the individuals'' quality of life and societal costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term cost effectiveness of an intervention targeting bathing disability among older people. For hypothetical cohorts of community-dwelling older people with bathing disability, transitions between states of dependency and death were modelled over 8 years including societal costs. A five-state Markov model based on states of dependency was used to evaluate Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs from a societal perspective. An intervention group was compared with a no intervention control group. The intervention focused on promoting safe and independent performance of bathing-related tasks. The intervention effect, based on previously published trials, was applied in the model as a 1.4 increased probability of recovery during the first year. Over the full follow-up period, the intervention resulted in QALY gains and reduced societal cost. After 8 years, the intervention resulted in 0.052 QALYs gained and reduced societal costs by euro2410 per person. In comparison to the intervention cost, the intervention effect was a more important factor for the magnitude of QALY gains and long-term societal costs. The intervention cost had only minor impact on societal costs. The conclusion was that an intervention targeting bathing disability among older people presents a cost-effective use of resources and leads to both QALY gains and reduced societal costs over 8 years.",2017-01-24623,28936134,Eur J Ageing,Magnus Zingmark,2017,14 / 3,233-241,No,28936134,"Magnus Zingmark; Ingeborg Nilsson; Fredrik Norstrom; Klas Goran Sahlen; Lars Lindholm; Cost effectiveness of an intervention focused on reducing bathing disability, Eur J Ageing, 2017 Sep; 14(3):1613-9380; 233-241",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Occupational therapy vs. No occupational therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,8 Years,3.00,3.00,-46346.15,Euro,2013,-68385.55
17954,Optimising the Diagnosis of Prostate Cancer in the Era of Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis Based on the Prostate MR Imaging Study (PROMIS),"BACKGROUND: The current recommendation of using transrectal ultrasound-guided biopsy (TRUSB) to diagnose prostate cancer misses clinically significant (CS) cancers. More sensitive biopsies (eg, template prostate mapping biopsy [TPMB]) are too resource intensive for routine use, and there is little evidence on multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MPMRI). OBJECTIVE: To identify the most effective and cost-effective way of using these tests to detect CS prostate cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cost-effectiveness modelling of health outcomes and costs of men referred to secondary care with a suspicion of prostate cancer prior to any biopsy in the UK National Health Service using information from the diagnostic Prostate MR Imaging Study (PROMIS). INTERVENTION: Combinations of MPMRI, TRUSB, and TPMB, using different definitions and diagnostic cut-offs for CS cancer. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Strategies that detect the most CS cancers given testing costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) given long-term costs. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The use of MPMRI first and then up to two MRI-targeted TRUSBs detects more CS cancers per pound spent than a strategy using TRUSB first (sensitivity = 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.92-0.98] vs 0.91 [95% CI 0.86-0.94]) and is cost effective (ICER = pound7,076 [euro8350/QALY gained]). The limitations stem from the evidence base in the accuracy of MRI-targeted biopsy and the long-term outcomes of men with CS prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: An MPMRI-first strategy is effective and cost effective for the diagnosis of CS prostate cancer. These findings are sensitive to the test costs, sensitivity of MRI-targeted TRUSB, and long-term outcomes of men with cancer, which warrant more empirical research.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cost-effectiveness modelling of health outcomes and costs of men referred to secondary care with a suspicion of prostate cancer prior to any biopsy in the UK National Health Service using information from the diagnostic Prostate MR Imaging Study (PROMIS). INTERVENTION: Combinations of MPMRI, TRUSB, and TPMB, using different definitions and diagnostic cut-offs for CS cancer. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Strategies that detect the most CS cancers given testing costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) given long-term costs. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: The use of MPMRI first and then up to two MRI-targeted TRUSBs detects more CS cancers per pound spent than a strategy using TRUSB first (sensitivity = 0.95 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.92-0.98] vs 0.91 [95% CI 0.86-0.94]) and is cost effective (ICER = pound7,076 [euro8350/QALY gained]). The limitations stem from the evidence base in the accuracy of MRI-targeted biopsy and the long-term outcomes of men with CS prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: An MPMRI-first strategy is effective and cost effective for the diagnosis of CS prostate cancer. These findings are sensitive to the test costs, sensitivity of MRI-targeted TRUSB, and long-term outcomes of men with cancer, which warrant more empirical research.

17967,Societal costs and effects of implementing population-based mammography screening in Greenland,"With a low breast cancer incidence and low population density, Greenland is geographically and organisationally challenged in implementing a cost effective breast cancer screening programme where a large proportion of the Greenlandic women will have to travel far to attend. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost utility of different strategies for implementing population-based breast cancer screening in Greenland. Two strategies were evaluated: Centralised screening in the capital Nuuk and decentralised screening in the five municipal regions of Greenland. A cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis were performed from a societal perspective to estimate the costs per years of life saved and per QALY gained. Two accommodation models for the women''s attendance were examined; accommodation in ordinary hotels or in patient hotels. The least costly accommodation model was the hotel model compared with the patient hotel model, regardless of screening strategy.

17968,Societal costs and effects of implementing population-based mammography screening in Greenland,"With a low breast cancer incidence and low population density, Greenland is geographically and organisationally challenged in implementing a cost effective breast cancer screening programme where a large proportion of the Greenlandic women will have to travel far to attend. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost utility of different strategies for implementing population-based breast cancer screening in Greenland. Two strategies were evaluated: Centralised screening in the capital Nuuk and decentralised screening in the five municipal regions of Greenland. A cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis were performed from a societal perspective to estimate the costs per years of life saved and per QALY gained. Two accommodation models for the women''s attendance were examined; accommodation in ordinary hotels or in patient hotels. The least costly accommodation model was the hotel model compared with the patient hotel model, regardless of screening strategy. The decentralised strategy was more cost effective compared with the centralised strategy, resulting in 0.5 million DKK per years of life saved (YLS) and 4.1 million DKK per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained within the hotel model.

17969,Economic Evaluation of Dupilumab for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis in Adults,"INTRODUCTION: Dupilumab significantly improves signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis (AD), including pruritus, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and health-related quality of life versus placebo in adults with moderate-to-severe AD. Since the cost-effectiveness of dupilumab has not been evaluated, the objective of this analysis was to estimate a value-based price range in which dupilumab would be considered cost-effective compared with supportive care (SC) for treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in an adult population. METHODS: A health economic model was developed to evaluate from the US payer perspective the long-term costs and benefits of dupilumab treatment administered every other week (q2w). Dupilumab q2w was compared with SC; robustness of assumptions and results were tested using sensitivity and scenario analyses. Clinical data were derived from the dupilumab LIBERTY AD SOLO trials; healthcare use and cost data were from health insurance claims histories of adult patients with AD. The annual price of maintenance therapy with dupilumab to be considered cost-effective was estimated for decision thresholds of US$100,000 and $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the base case, the annual maintenance price for dupilumab therapy to be considered cost-effective would be $28,770 at a $100,000 per QALY gained threshold, and $39,940 at a $150,000 threshold. Results were generally robust to parameter variations in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Dupilumab q2w compared with SC is cost-effective for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in US adults at an annual price of maintenance therapy in the range of $29,000-$40,000 at the $100,000-$150,000 per QALY thresholds.

17971,Palbociclib in hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer: A cost-utility analysis,"INTRODUCTION: The addition of palbociclib to letrozole improves progression-free survival in the first-line treatment of hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer (ABC). This study assesses the cost-utility of palbociclib from the Canadian healthcare payer perspective. METHODS: A probabilistic discrete event simulation (DES) model was developed and parameterised with data from the PALOMA 1 and 2 trials and other sources. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-month (QALM) gained for palbociclib was calculated. A time horizon of 15 years was used in the base case with costs and effectiveness discounted at 5% annually. Time-to- progression and time-to-death were derived from a Weibull and exponential distribution. Expected costs were based on Ontario fees and other sources. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Compared to letrozole, the addition of palbociclib provided an additional 14.7 QALM at an incremental cost of $161,508. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $10,999/QALM gained. Assuming a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $4167/QALM, the probability of palbociclib to be cost-effective was 0%. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves derived from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that at a WTP of $11,000/QALM gained, the probability of palbociclib to be cost-effective was 50%. CONCLUSION: The addition of palbociclib to letrozole is unlikely to be cost-effective for the treatment of ABC from a Canadian healthcare perspective with its current price. While ABC patients derive a meaningful clinical benefit from palbociclib, considerations should be given to increase the WTP threshold and reduce the drug pricing, to render this strategy more affordable.",2017-01-24637,28930692,Eur J Cancer,J Raphael,2017,85 /,146-154,No,28930692,"J Raphael; J Helou; K I Pritchard; D M Naimark; Palbociclib in hormone receptor positive advanced breast cancer: A cost-utility analysis, Eur J Cancer, 2017 Nov; 85():0959-8049; 146-154",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Palbociclib plus letrozole vs. Letrozole,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,15 Years,5.00,5.00,10999.16,Canada,2015,9404.52
17972,Recombinant Parathyroid Hormone Versus Usual Care: Do the Outcomes Justify the Cost?,"BACKGROUND: Hypoparathyroidism is a potential outcome of anterior neck surgery. Commonly it is managed by calcium and vitamin D supplementation in large doses, with attendant side effects. A recombinant human parathyroid hormone (rhPTH) is now available in the USA, offering a potentially more effective treatment. No cost-effectiveness model investigating this new medication versus standard care has yet been published. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model comparing usual care versus rhPTH treatment for postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Threshold and sensitivity analyses on key parameters were conducted to assess robustness of the model. Costs and health outcomes were represented in US dollars and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: The rhPTH strategy was both more costly and more effective than the usual care (UC) strategy. In the base case, UC cost $37,196 and provided 7.54 QALYs. The rhPTH strategy cost $777,224 and provided 8.46 QALYs for an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $804,378/QALY. As this was above our willingness-to-pay of $100,000, treatment with rhPTH was not considered cost-effective. The model was robust to all other parameters. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first formal cost-effectiveness analysis of rhPTH in comparison with UC. Our model suggests that although the new treatment is slightly more effective than UC, the modest gain in quality of life for patients who are reasonably well-managed by UC does not justify the cost. However, consideration must be given to rhPTH for patients who have failed UC, as the expenditure may be justified in that context.",2017-01-24639,28929381,World J Surg,Kathryn H Chomsky-Higgins,2017,/,,No,28929381,"Kathryn H Chomsky-Higgins; Holly M Rochefort; Carolyn D Seib; Jessica E Gosnell; Wen T Shen; Quan-Yang Duh; Insoo Suh; Recombinant Parathyroid Hormone Versus Usual Care: Do the Outcomes Justify the Cost?, World J Surg, 2017 Apr 25; ():0364-2313",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Recombinant human parathyroid hormone vs. Standard/Usual Care- Calcium and vitamin D supplements,Patients with no contraindications to recombinant parathyroid hormone and stable calcium and vitamin supplementation,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,804378,United States,2017,849305.95
17973,Burden of non-adherence to latent tuberculosis infection drug therapy and the potential cost-effectiveness of adherence interventions in Canada: a simulation study,"OBJECTIVE: Pharmaceutical treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reduces the risk of progression to active tuberculosis (TB); however, poor adherence tempers the protective effect. We aimed to estimate the health burden of non-adherence, the maximum allowable cost of hypothetical new adherence interventions to be cost-effective and the potential value of existing adherence interventions for patients with low-risk LTBI in Canada. DESIGN: A microsimulation model of LTBI progression over 25 years. SETTING: General practice in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with LTBI who are initiating drug therapy. INTERVENTIONS: A hypothetical intervention with a range of effectiveness was evaluated. Existing drug adherence interventions including peer support, two-way text messaging support, enhanced adherence counselling and adherence incentives were also evaluated. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Simulation outcomes included healthcare costs, TB incidence, TB deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Base case results were interpreted against a willingness-to-pay threshold of $C50 000/QALY. RESULTS: Compared with current adherence levels, full adherence to LTBI drug therapy could reduce new TB cases from 90.3 cases per 100 000 person-years to 35.9 cases per 100 000 person-years and reduce TB-related deaths from 7.9 deaths per 100 000 person-years to 3.1 deaths per 100 000 person-years. An intervention that increases relative adherence by 40% would bring the population near full adherence to drug therapy and could have a maximum allowable annual cost of approximately $C450 per person to be cost-effective. Based on estimates of effect sizes and costs of existing adherence interventions, we found that they yielded between 900 and 2400 additional QALYs per million people, reduced TB deaths by 5%-25% and were likely to be cost-effective over 25 years. CONCLUSION: Full adherence could reduce the number of future TB cases by nearly 60%, offsetting TB-related costs and health burden.

17974,Cost-Effectiveness of Thrombectomy in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: The THRACE Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The benefit of mechanical thrombectomy added to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke has been largely demonstrated. However, evidence of the economic incentive of this strategy is still limited, especially in the context of a randomized controlled trial. We aimed to analyze whether mechanical thrombectomy combined with IVT (IVMT) is cost-effective when compared with IVT alone. METHODS: Individual-level cost and outcome data were collected in the THRACE randomized controlled trial (Thrombectomie des Arteres Cerebrales) including patients with acute ischemic stroke. Patients were assigned to receive IVT or IVMT. The primary outcomes were modified Rankin Scale score of functional independence at 90 days (score 0-2) and the EuroQol-5D quality-of-life score at 1 year. RESULTS: Treating acute ischemic stroke with IVMT (n=200) versus IVT (n=202) increased the rate of functional independence by 10.9% (53.0% versus 42.1%; P=0.028), at an increased cost of $2116 (euro1909), with no significant difference in mortality (12% versus 13%; P=0.70) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (2% versus 2%; P=0.71). The cost per one averted case of disability was estimated at $19 379 (euro17 480). The incremental cost per one quality-adjusted life year gained was $14 881 (euro13 423). On sensitivity analysis, the probability of cost-effectiveness with IVMT was 84.1% in terms of cases of averted disability and 92.2% in terms of quality-adjusted life years.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed from the healthcare payer perspective to simulate the history of a 66-year-old man with low-risk PCa. The model followed patients yearly over their remaining lifetimes. Health states included ''recurrence-free'', ''biochemical recurrence'' (BR), ''metastatic'' and ''death''. Transition probabilities were based on a retrospective cohort analysis undertaken at our institution. Utilities were derived from the literature. Costs were assigned in 2015 Canadian dollars ($) and reflected Ontario''s health system and departmental costs. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 000/QALY was used. RESULTS: SBRT was the dominant strategy with 0.008LYs and 0.029QALYs gained and a reduction in cost of $2615. Under base case conditions, our results were sensitive to the BR probability associated with both strategies.

Willingness to pay was established at $50,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: According to our model, the PGx strategy showed a QALY increase of 0.0021, with an increase in total cost of $272. This corresponds to an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of $127,501, ranging from $95,690 to $148,611.

The Peninsula Technology Assessment Group, commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG), critically reviewed the company''s submission. Clinical effectiveness evidence for the company''s analysis was derived from an open-label, randomised controlled trial, JGDG. The analysis was based on a partitioned survival model with a time horizon of 25 years, and the perspective was of the UK National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3.5% per year. Given the available evidence, olaratumab is likely to meet NICE''s end-of-life criteria. To improve the cost effectiveness of olaratumab, the company offered a discount through a Commercial Access Agreement (CAA) with the NHS England. When the discount was applied, the mean base-case and probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for olaratumab plus doxorubicin versus the standard-of-care doxorubicin were pound46,076 and pound47,127 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively; the probability of this treatment being cost effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold of pound50,000 per QALY gained, applicable to end-of-life treatments, was 0.54.

17990,Access criteria for anti-TNF agents in spondyloarthritis: influence on comparative 1-year cost-effectiveness estimates,"BACKGROUND: Anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents are an effective, but costly, treatment for spondyloarthritis (SpA). Worldwide, multiple sets of access criteria aim to restrict anti-TNF therapy to patients with specific clinical characteristics, yet the influence of access criteria on anti-TNF cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our objective was to use data from the DESIR cohort, a prospective study of early SpA patients in France, to determine whether the French anti-TNF access criteria are the most cost-effective in that setting relative to other potential restrictions. METHODS: We used data from the DESIR cohort to create five study populations of patients meeting anti-TNF access criteria from Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, respectively. For each study population, we calculated the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 1 year of patients treated and not treated with anti-TNF therapy. To control for differences between anti-TNF users and non-users, we used linear regression models to derive adjusted mean costs and QALYs. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) representing the incremental cost per additional QALY gained by treating with an anti-TNF within each of the five study populations, using bootstrapping to explore the range of uncertainty in costs and QALYs.

Worldwide, multiple sets of access criteria aim to restrict anti-TNF therapy to patients with specific clinical characteristics, yet the influence of access criteria on anti-TNF cost-effectiveness is unknown. Our objective was to use data from the DESIR cohort, a prospective study of early SpA patients in France, to determine whether the French anti-TNF access criteria are the most cost-effective in that setting relative to other potential restrictions. METHODS: We used data from the DESIR cohort to create five study populations of patients meeting anti-TNF access criteria from Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and Hong Kong, respectively. For each study population, we calculated the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over 1 year of patients treated and not treated with anti-TNF therapy. To control for differences between anti-TNF users and non-users, we used linear regression models to derive adjusted mean costs and QALYs. We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) representing the incremental cost per additional QALY gained by treating with an anti-TNF within each of the five study populations, using bootstrapping to explore the range of uncertainty in costs and QALYs.

17995,Cost effectiveness of vildagliptin versus glimepiride as add-on treatment to metformin for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 patients in Greece,"OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the cost-effectiveness of vildagliptin versus glimepiride as add-on to metformin in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients in the Greek healthcare setting. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was designed, using MS Excel, to compare two treatment strategies. Strategy 1 consisted of first-line metformin, followed by metformin + vildagliptin in second-line, while strategy 2 consisted of first line metformin, followed by metformin + glimepiride in second line. Subsequent lines were the same in both strategies and consisted of metformin + basal insulin and metformin + basal + rapid insulin. Clinical data and utility decrements relating to diabetes complications were taken from the published literature. Only direct medical costs were included in the analysis (cost base year 2014), and consisted of drug, adverse events and comorbidity costs (taken from local officially published sources and the literature). The perspective adopted was that of the Social Insurance Fund. The time horizon was lifetime, and future costs and outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. RESULTS: Adding vildagliptin to metformin increased drug costs compared with adding glimepiride to metformin (euro2853 vs. euro2427, respectively). However, this increase was offset by a decrease in the costs of associated comorbidities (euro4393 vs. euro4539) and adverse events (euro2757 vs. euro3111), resulting in a lower total cost of euro74 in strategy 1 compared with strategy 2. Comorbidities were the largest cost component in both strategies, accounting for 43.9 and 45.0% in strategies 1 and 2, respectively. Strategy 1 was also associated with increased life-years (LYs, 0.11) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs, 0.11) compared with strategy 2. Strategy 1 is therefore dominant, as it is associated with both lower overall costs and increased effectiveness.

17996,Arthroscopic meniscectomy for degenerative meniscal tears reduces knee pain but is not cost-effective in a routine health care setting: a multi-center longitudinal observational study using data from the osteoarthritis initiative,"OBJECTIVES: It is disputed whether arthroscopic meniscectomy is an (cost-) effective treatment for degenerative meniscus tears in day-to-day clinical practice. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic meniscectomy in subjects with knee osteoarthritis, in routine clinical practice, while taking into account the increased risk for future knee replacement surgery. We compared cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic meniscectomy compared to no surgery. DESIGN: We used a state transition (Markov) simulation model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of arthroscopic meniscectomy compared to no surgery in subjects with knee osteoarthritis (age range 45-79 years). Data used in the preparation of the current study were obtained from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (AOI) database. We applied a 9 years'' time horizon (which is equal to the current OAI study follow up period), and evaluated cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective. The main outcome measure was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (Euros per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) gained). RESULTS: Arthroscopic meniscectomy was associated with 8.09 (SD +/- 0.07) QALYs at a cost of euro 21,345 (SD +/- 841), whereas the no surgery was associated with 8.05 (SD +/- 0.07) QALYs at a cost of euro 16,284 (SD +/- 855). For arthroscopic meniscectomy, the incremental cost per QALY gained was euro 150,754. CONCLUSIONS: In day-to-day clinical practice, arthroscopic meniscectomy in subjects with knee osteoarthritis is associated with euro 150,754 per QALY gained, which exceeds the generally accepted willingness to pay (WTP) (range euro 20,000-euro 80,000).",2017-01-24678,28903016,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,J J Rongen,2017,/,,No,28903016,"J J Rongen; T M Govers; P Buma; M M Rovers; G Hannink; Arthroscopic meniscectomy for degenerative meniscal tears reduces knee pain but is not cost-effective in a routine health care setting: a multi-center longitudinal observational study using data from the osteoarthritis initiative, Osteoarthritis Cartilage, 2017 Sep 10; ():1063-4584",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Arthroscopic meniscectomy vs. No surgery,Patients with mild or moderate disease,79 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,9 Years,4.00,1.50,126525,Euro,2015,153319.19
17997,Cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination in the context of high cervical cancer incidence and low screening coverage,"BACKGROUND: Estonia has high cervical cancer incidence and low screening coverage. We modelled the impact of population-based bivalent, quadrivalent or nonavalent HPV vaccination alongside cervical cancer screening. METHODS: A Markov cohort model of the natural history of HPV infection was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating a cohort of 12-year-old girls with bivalent, quadrivalent or nonavalent vaccine in two doses in a national, school-based vaccination programme. The model followed the natural progression of HPV infection into subsequent genital warts (GW); premalignant lesions (CIN1-3); cervical, oropharyngeal, vulvar, vaginal and anal cancer. Vaccine coverage was assumed to be 70%. A time horizon of 88years (up to 100years of age) was used to capture all lifetime vaccination costs and benefits. Costs and utilities were discounted using an annual discount rate of 5%. RESULTS: Vaccination of 12-year-old girls alongside screening compared to screening alone had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro14,007 (bivalent), euro14,067 (quadrivalent) and euro11,633 (nonavalent) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in the base-case scenario and ranged between euro5367-21,711, euro5142-21,800 and euro4563-18,142, respectively, in sensitivity analysis. The results were most sensitive to changes in discount rate, vaccination regimen, vaccine prices and cervical cancer screening coverage. CONCLUSION: Vaccination of 12-year-old girls alongside current cervical cancer screening can be considered a cost-effective intervention in Estonia. Adding HPV vaccination to the national immunisation schedule is expected to prevent a considerable number of HPV infections, genital warts, premalignant lesions, HPV related cancers and deaths.

18000,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Intradiscal Electrothermal Therapy Compared with Circumferential Lumbar Fusion,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET) relative to circumferential lumbar fusion with femoral ring allograft (FRA) in the United Kingdom. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Circumferential lumbar fusion is an established treatment for discogenic low back pain. However, IDET could be a cost-effective treatment alternative as it can be carried out as a day case. METHODS: Patient-level data were available for patients with discogenic low back pain treated with FRA (n = 37) in a randomized trial of FRA vs. titanium cage, and for patients recruited to a separate study evaluating the use of IDET (n = 85). Both studies were carried out at a single institution in the United Kingdom. Patients were followed-up for 24 months, with data collected on low back disability (Oswestry Disability Index), back and leg pain (visual analog scale), quality of life (Short Form 36), radiographic evaluations, and U.K. National Health Service (NHS) resource use. Cost-effectiveness was measured by the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Both treatments produced statistically significant improvements in outcome at 24-month follow-up. NHS costs were significantly lower with IDET due to a shorter mean procedure time (377.4 minutes vs. 49.9 minutes) and length of stay (7 days vs. 1.2 days). At a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY, the probability that IDET is cost effective is high.
