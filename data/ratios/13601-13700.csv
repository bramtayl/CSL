13601,Should we await IFN-free regimens to treat HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive patients? A cost-effectiveness analysis (ANRS 95141),"BACKGROUND & AIMS: In treatment-naive patients mono-infected with genotype 1 chronic HCV, treatments with telaprevir/boceprevir (TVR/BOC)-based triple therapy are standard-of-care. However, more efficacious direct-acting antivirals (IFN-based new DAAs) are available and interferon-free (IFN-free) regimens are imminent (2015). METHODS: A mathematical model estimated quality-adjusted life years, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of (i) IFN-based new DAAs vs. TVR/BOC-based triple therapy; and (ii) IFN-based new DAAs initiation strategies, given that IFN-free regimens are imminent. The sustained virological response in F3-4/F0-2 was 71/89% with IFN-based new DAAs, 85/95% with IFN-free regimens, vs. 64/80% with TVR/BOC-based triple therapy. Serious adverse events leading to discontinuation were taken as: 0-0.6% with IFN-based new DAAs, 0% with IFN-free regimens, vs. 1-10% with TVR/BOC-based triple therapy. Costs were euro60,000 for 12weeks of IFN-based new DAAs and two times higher for IFN-free regimens. RESULTS: Treatment with IFN-based new DAAs when fibrosis stage F2 is cost-effective compared to TVR/BOC-based triple therapy (euro37,900/QALY gained), but not at F0-1 (euro103,500/QALY gained). Awaiting the IFN-free regimens is more effective, except in F4 patients, but not cost-effective compared to IFN-based new DAAs. If we decrease the cost of IFN-free regimens close to that of IFN-based new DAAs, then awaiting the IFN-free regimen becomes cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IFN-based new DAAs at stage F2 is both effective and cost-effective compared to TVR/BOC triple therapy. Awaiting IFN-free regimens and then treating regardless of fibrosis is more efficacious, except in F4 patients; however, the cost-effectiveness of this strategy is highly dependent on its cost.",2014-01-16864,24650691,J Hepatol,Sylvie Deuffic-Burban,2014,61 / 1,7-14,No,24650691,"Sylvie Deuffic-Burban; Michael Schwarzinger; Dorothee Obach; Vincent Mallet; Stanislas Pol; Georges-Philippe Pageaux; Valerie Canva; Pierre Deltenre; Francoise Roudot-Thoraval; Dominique Larrey; Daniel Dhumeaux; Philippe Mathurin; Yazdan Yazdanpanah; Should we await IFN-free regimens to treat HCV genotype 1 treatment-naive patients?

13605,Economic evaluation of a web-based tailored lifestyle intervention for adults: findings regarding cost-effectiveness and cost-utility from a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Different studies have reported the effectiveness of Web-based computer-tailored lifestyle interventions, but economic evaluations of these interventions are scarce. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a sequential and a simultaneous Web-based computer-tailored lifestyle intervention for adults compared to a control group. METHODS: The economic evaluation, conducted from a societal perspective, was part of a 2-year randomized controlled trial including 3 study groups. All groups received personalized health risk appraisals based on the guidelines for physical activity, fruit intake, vegetable intake, alcohol consumption, and smoking. Additionally, respondents in the sequential condition received personal advice about one lifestyle behavior in the first year and a second behavior in the second year; respondents in the simultaneous condition received personal advice about all unhealthy behaviors in both years. During a period of 24 months, health care use, medication use, absenteeism from work, and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed every 3 months using Web-based questionnaires. Demographics were assessed at baseline, and lifestyle behaviors were assessed at both baseline and after 24 months. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses were performed based on the outcome measures lifestyle factor (the number of guidelines respondents adhered to) and quality of life, respectively. We accounted for uncertainty by using bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1733 respondents were included in the analyses. From a willingness to pay of euro4594 per additional guideline met, the sequential intervention (n=552) was likely to be the most cost-effective, whereas from a willingness to pay of euro10,850, the simultaneous intervention (n=517) was likely to be most cost-effective. The control condition (n=664) appeared to be preferred with regard to quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Both the sequential and the simultaneous lifestyle interventions were likely to be cost-effective when it concerned the lifestyle factor, whereas the control condition was when it concerned quality of life. However, there is no accepted cutoff point for the willingness to pay per gain in lifestyle behaviors, making it impossible to draw firm conclusions. Further economic evaluations of lifestyle interventions are needed.

13608,Cost-utility analysis of sodium polystyrene sulfonate vs. potential alternatives for chronic hyperkalemia,"PURPOSE: Hyperkalemia during renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition (RAAS-I) may prevent optimum dosing. Treatment options include sodium polystyrene sulfonate potassium binding resins, but safety and efficacy concerns exist, including associated colonic necrosis (CN). Alternative agents have been studied, but cost-utility has not been estimated. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis of outpatients >/= 18 years of age receiving chronic RAAS-I, with a history of hyperkalemia or chronic kidney disease, prescribed either sodium polystyrene sulfonate or a theoretical ""drug X"" binding resin for chronic hyperkalemia. Data were obtained from existing literature. We used a decision analytic model with Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses, from a health care payer perspective and a 12-month time horizon. Costs were measured in US dollars. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Drug X could cost no more than $ 10.77 per daily dose to be cost-effective, at a willingness-to- pay (WTP) threshold of $ 50,000/QALY. At $ 40.00 per daily dose, drug X achieved an incremental cost effectiveness ratio of $26,088,369.00 per QALY gained. One-way sensitivity analysis showed sodium polystyrene sulfonate to be the cost-effective option for CN incidences </= 19.9%. Limitations include incomplete information on outpatient outcomes and lack of data directly comparing sodium polystyrene sulfonate to potential alternatives. CONCLUSIONS: Alternatives may not be cost-effective unless priced similarly to sodium polystyrene sulfonate. This analysis may guide decisions regarding adoption of alternative agents for chronic hyperkalemia control, and suggests that sodium polystyrene sulfonate be employed as an active control in clinical trials of these agents.",2014-01-16873,24656316,Clin Nephrol,Dustin J Little,2014,81 / 4,259-68,No,24656316,"Dustin J Little; Robert Nee; Kevin C Abbott; Maura A Watson; Christina M Yuan; Cost-utility analysis of sodium polystyrene sulfonate vs. potential alternatives for chronic hyperkalemia, Clin Nephrol, ; 81(4):0301-0430; 259-68",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sodium polystyrene sulfonate vs. potential alternatives,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,26088369.37,United States,2011,30016835.52
13609,Psycho-educational CBT-Insomnia workshops in the community. A cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial,"Around one in three of the UK population suffer from sleep problems, resulting in high costs to society. Cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) has been shown to be effective. Community-based workshops may be a cost-effective way to provide CBT-I to groups that are usually hard to reach or reluctant to seek treatment. A sample of 151 participants aged 18 or over from five London boroughs who self-referred were randomised into a group receiving workshops and a waiting list control group. 111 provided complete data on service use and outcome measures. Results from the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses are presented using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. At a maximum willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of pound30,000, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective is 80%. If commissioners are willing to pay pound150 per point improvement on the Insomnia Severity Index, which is approximately the cost of the intervention, there is a 97% probability of cost-effectiveness. Community-based CBT-I workshops are likely to be a cost-effective intervention to improve insomnia symptoms and are a promising low-level option to include within the panoply of interventions that are encouraged within the UK policy of increasing access to psychological therapies.",2014-01-16882,24607500,Behav Res Ther,Eva-Maria Bonin,2014,55 /,40-7,No,24607500,"Eva-Maria Bonin; Jennifer Beecham; Naomi Swift; Shriti Raikundalia; June S L Brown; Psycho-educational CBT-Insomnia workshops in the community.

13610,Cost-effectiveness analysis of universal influenza vaccination with quadrivalent inactivated vaccine in the United States,"To address influenza B lineage mismatch and co-circulation, several quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV4s) containing two type A strains and both type B lineages have recently been approved in the United States. Currently available trivalent inactivated vaccines (IIV3s) or trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV3s) comprise two influenza A strains and one of the two influenza B lineages that have co-circulated in the United States since 2001. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a policy of universal vaccination with IIV4 vs. IIV3/LAIV3 during 1 year in the United States. On average per influenza season, IIV4 was predicted to result in 30,251 fewer influenza cases, 3512 fewer hospitalizations, 722 fewer deaths, 4812 fewer life-years lost, and 3596 fewer quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost vs. IIV3/LAIV3. Using the Fluarix Quadrivalent(TM) (GlaxoSmithKline) prices and the weighted average IIV3/LAIV3 prices, the model predicts that the vaccination program costs would increase by $452.2 million, while direct medical and indirect costs would decrease by $111.6 million and $218.7 million, respectively, with IIV4. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing IIV4 to IIV3/LAIV3 is predicted to be $90,301/QALY gained. Deterministic sensitivity analyses found that influenza B vaccine-matched and mismatched efficacies among adults aged >/=65 years had the greatest impact on the ICER. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the cost per QALY remained below $100,000 for 61% of iterations. In conclusion, vaccination with IIV4 in the US is predicted to reduce morbidity and mortality.

Currently, there are no cost-effectiveness studies of eplerenone use in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II CHF. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the cost effectiveness of eplerenone compared with placebo in patients with chronic systolic heart failure and NYHA class II symptoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: A 10-year Markov model with yearly cycles was constructed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of eplerenone compared with placebo, based on data from the EMPHASIS-HF (Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization And Survival Study in Heart Failure) study. The model classified subjects into two health states: ''Alive with CHF'' and ''Dead''. Information about the cost of disease was derived from Australian Refined Diagnosis-Related Groups (AR-DRG) data. The cost of eplerenone was taken from the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme. Utility data were derived from published sources, and a 5 % annual discount rate was applied to future costs and benefits. Over 10 years, and compared with placebo, the model predicted that eplerenone would lead to a saving of 0.5 life-years (discounted) and 0.4 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per person. The net cost was (in Australian dollars [$A]) $A6,117 (discounted) per person. These equated to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $A12,024 per life-year saved and $A16,700 per QALY saved. Sensitivity analyses indicated that these results were robust.

13612,Modelling cost effectiveness in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: the impact of using contrast sensitivity vs. visual acuity,"BACKGROUND: The cost utility of treatments of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is commonly assessed using health state transition models defined by levels of visual acuity. However, there is evidence that another measure of visual function, contrast sensitivity, may be better associated with utility than visual acuity. This paper investigates the difference in cost effectiveness resulting from models based on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity using the example of bevacizumab (Avastin) for neovascular AMD. The implications of the choice of outcome on structural uncertainty in the model are investigated. METHOD: Health state transition Markov models based on levels of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity are used to represent the costs, health utilities and outcomes of the Avastin for choroidal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (ABC) trial. Health states are associated with costs and utilities based on literature values. Treatment outcomes from the ABC trial are used to predict transitions between states in both models. Total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are calculated for a cohort of patients treated over a defined number of model cycles. RESULTS: Over a 5-year time horizon, a contrast sensitivity model predicts a statistically significant (p < 0.05) 25% greater QALY gain than the visual acuity model based on 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Bevacizumab is more effective and less costly than the comparator in the contrast sensitivity model and the visual acuity model. CONCLUSION: There is considerable structural uncertainty associated with the choice of outcome for modelling the cost effectiveness of AMD treatments. Bevacizumab has a higher incremental QALY gain and more favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio when cost effectiveness is assessed using contrast sensitivity outcomes compared with using visual acuity outcomes.

13613,Using the coronary artery calcium score to guide statin therapy: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score predicts future coronary heart disease (CHD) events and could be used to guide primary prevention interventions, but CAC measurement has costs and exposes patients to low-dose radiation. METHODS AND RESULTS: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of measuring CAC and prescribing statin therapy based on the resulting score under a range of assumptions using an established model enhanced with CAC distribution and risk estimates from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Ten years of statin treatment for 10,000 55-year-old women with high cholesterol (10-year CHD risk, 7.5%) was projected to prevent 32 myocardial infarctions, cause 70 cases of statin-induced myopathy, and add 1108 years to total life expectancy. Measuring CAC and targeting statin treatment to the 2500 women with CAC>0 would provide 45% of the benefit (+501 life-years), but CAC measurement would cost $2.25 million and cause 9 radiation-induced cancers. Treat all was preferable to CAC screening in this scenario and across a broad range of other scenarios (CHD risk, 2.5%-15%) when statin assumptions were favorable ($0.13 per pill and no quality of life penalty). When statin assumptions were less favorable ($1.00 per pill and disutility=0.00384), CAC screening with statin treatment for persons with CAC>0 was cost-effective (<$50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year) in this scenario, in 55-year-old men with CHD risk 7.5%, and in other intermediate risk scenarios (CHD risk, 5%-10%). Our results were critically sensitive to statin cost and disutility and relatively robust to other assumptions. Alternate CAC treatment thresholds (>100 or >300) were generally not cost-effective.

13617,Cost-effectiveness analysis of intra-articular injections of a high molecular weight bioengineered hyaluronic acid for the treatment of osteoarthritis knee pain,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of bioengineered hyaluronic acid (BioHA, 1% sodium hyaluronate) intra-articular injections in treating osteoarthritis knee pain in poor responders to conventional care (CC) including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and analgesics. METHODS: Two decision analytic models compared BioHA treatment with either continuation of patient''s baseline CC with no assumption of disease progression (Model 1), or CC including escalating care costs due to disease progression (NSAIDs and analgesics, corticosteroid injections, and surgery; Model 2). Analyses were based on patients who received two courses of 3-weekly intra-articular BioHA (26-week FLEXX Trial + 26-week Extension Study). BioHA group costs included fees for physician assessment and injection regimen, plus half of CC costs. Cost-effectiveness ratios were expressed as averages and incremental costs per QALY. One-way sensitivity analyses used the 95% confidence interval (CI) of QALYs gained in BioHA-treated patients, and +/-20% of BioHA treatment and CC costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed for Model 2. RESULTS: For 214 BioHA patients, the average utility gain was 0.163 QALYs (95% CI = -0.162 to 0.488) over 52 weeks. Model 1 treatment costs were $3469 and $4562 for the BioHA and CC groups, respectively; sensitivity analyses showed BioHA to be the dominant treatment strategy, except when at the lower end of the 95% CI. Model 2 annual treatment costs per QALY gained were $1446 and $516 for the BioHA and CC groups, respectively. Using CC as baseline strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of BioHA was $38,741/QALY gained, and was sensitive to response rates in either the BioHA or CC groups. CONCLUSION: BioHA is less costly and more effective than CC with NSAIDs and analgesics, and is the dominant treatment strategy.

13622,Second-line agents for glycemic control for type 2 diabetes: are newer agents better?,"OBJECTIVE: While metformin is generally accepted as the first-line agent in treatment of type 2 diabetes, there are insufficient evidence and extensive debate about the best second-line agent. We aimed to assess the benefits and harms of four commonly used antihyperglycemia treatment regimens considering clinical effectiveness, quality of life, and cost. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed and validated a new population-based glycemic control Markov model that simulates natural variation in HbA1c progression. The model was calibrated using a U.S. data set of privately insured individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. We compared treatment intensification of metformin monotherapy with sulfonylurea, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, or insulin. Outcome measures included life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), mean time to insulin dependence, and expected medication cost per QALY from diagnosis to first diabetes complication (ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, stroke, blindness, renal failure, amputation) or death. RESULTS: According to our model, all regimens resulted in similar LYs and QALYs regardless of glycemic control goal, but the regimen with sulfonylurea incurred significantly lower cost per QALY and resulted in the longest time to insulin dependence. An HbA1c goal of 7% (53 mmol/mol) produced higher QALYs compared with a goal of 8% (64 mmol/mol) for all regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Use of sulfonylurea as second-line therapy for type 2 diabetes generated glycemic control and QALYs comparable with those associated with other agents but at lower cost. A model that incorporates HbA1c and diabetes complications can serve as a useful clinical decision tool for selection of treatment options.",2014-01-16925,24574345,Diabetes Care,Yuanhui Zhang,2014,37 / 5,1338-45,No,24574345,"Yuanhui Zhang; Rozalina G McCoy; Jennifer E Mason; Steven A Smith; Nilay D Shah; Brian T Denton; Second-line agents for glycemic control for type 2 diabetes: are newer agents better?, Diabetes Care, ; 37(5):0149-5992; 1338-45",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Metformin monotherapy vs. sulfonylurea as a second-line agent,Not Stated,64 Years,41 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,2537,United States,2013,2818.56
13623,Cost-effectiveness analysis of extended duration anticoagulation with rivaroxaban to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism,"INTRODUCTION: Extended duration anticoagulation with rivaroxaban for an additional 6-12 months can reduce recurrent venous thromboembolic events (VTE) compared to placebo by ~82%, but at the detriment of increased bleeding. We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of extended duration prophylaxis of recurrent VTE with rivaroxaban. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of extended duration rivaroxaban, 20mg daily, compared to placebo using a Medicare perspective, a one-monthcycle length and a 40-year time horizon. The model assumed a cohort of 58-year-old patients who had already completed an initial 6-12 months of anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or a vitamin K antagonist; and whom prescribers had clinical equipoise with respect to the need for continued anticoagulation. Data sources included EINSTEIN-Extension and other published studies of VTE. Outcomes included direct treatment costs (in 2013US$), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: Extended duration rivaroxaban resulted in higher treatment costs ($22,645 vs. $22,083) but yielded greater QALYs (16.167 vs. 16.134) as compared to placebo; corresponding to an ICER of $17,030/QALY gained. Our model was most sensitive to the baseline risk of bleeding and recurrent VTE, the hazard ratio of developing a recurrent event while on rivaroxaban and time horizon. Monte Carlo Simulation suggested rivaroxaban would be cost-effective in 66% of 10,000 iterations, assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: Despite the cost of rivaroxaban and an increased risk of bleeding, extending VTE treatment for an additional 6-12 months with rivaroxaban was found cost-effective compared to the placebo over a 40-year time horizon.",2014-01-16928,24582461,Thromb Res,Craig I Coleman,2014,133 / 5,743-9,No,24582461,"Craig I Coleman; Brendan L Limone; Brahim K Bookhart; Samir H Mody; Edith A Nutescu; Cost-effectiveness analysis of extended duration anticoagulation with rivaroxaban to prevent recurrent venous thromboembolism, Thromb Res, ; 133(5):1879-2472; 743-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rivaroxaban (20 mg daily) vs. Placebo,Not Stated,58 Years,58 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,17030,United States,2013,18920.02
13624,Cost effectiveness of routine laparoscopic ultrasound for assessment of resectability of gallbladder cancer,"BACKGROUND: In addition to a diagnostic laparoscopy (DL), a routine laparoscopic ultrasound (LUS) has been proposed to identify undetected hepatic metastases and/or anatomically advanced disease in patients with T2 or higher gall bladder cancer (GBC) patients planned for surgical resection. It was hypothesized that a routine LUS is not a cost-effective strategy for these patients. METHODS: Decision tree modeling was undertaken to compare DL-LUS vs. DL at the time of definitive resection of GBC (with no prior cholecystectomy). Costs in US dollars (payer''s perspective), quality-adjusted life weeks (QALWs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated (horizon: 6 weeks, willingness-to-pay: $1,000/QALW or $50,000/QALY). RESULTS: DL-LUS was cost effective at the base case scenario (costs: $30,838 for DL vs. $30,791 for DL-LUS and effectiveness 3.81 QALWs DL vs. 3.82 QALW DL-LUS), resulting in a cost reduction of $9,220 per quality-adjusted life week gained (or $479,469 per QALY). DL-LUS became less cost effective as the cost of ultrasound increased or the probability of exclusion from resection decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Routine LUS with DL for the assessment of resectability and exclusion of metastases is cost effective for patients with GBC. Until improvements in preoperative imaging occur to decrease the probability of exclusion, this appears to be a feasible strategy.",2014-01-16942,24590431,Ann Surg Oncol,Hasan Nadeem,2014,21 / 7,2413-9,No,24590431,"Hasan Nadeem; Thejus T Jayakrishnan; Ryan T Groeschl; Anthony Zacharias; T Clark Gamblin; Kiran K Turaga; Cost effectiveness of routine laparoscopic ultrasound for assessment of resectability of gallbladder cancer, Ann Surg Oncol, ; 21(7):1068-9265; 2413-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Diagnostic laparoscopic ultrasound for assessment of resectability + routine diagnostic laparoscopy (DL-LUS) vs. Diagnostic laparoscopy (DL),stage T2 or higher,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-47000,United States,2013,-52216.14
13625,A cost-effectiveness analysis of postoperative goal-directed therapy for high-risk surgical patients,"OBJECTIVES: Patients undergoing major surgery are at high risk of increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Goal-directed therapy has been shown to improve outcomes when commenced in the early postoperative period, yet the economic impact remains unclear. The aim of our study was to assess the cost effectiveness of goal-directed therapy as part of postoperative management. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis to determine short and long term clinical and financial benefits. A decision tree was constructed to determine short-term ""in-hospital"" costs, based on outcome data derived from a previous study. For a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis, we created a simulation model to estimate life expectancy (quality-adjusted) and lifetime costs for a hypothetical cohort of major noncardiac surgical patients. Cost and outcome comparisons were made between postoperative goal-directed therapy and best standard therapy and described as cost/hospital survivor and cost/patient for the short-term analysis and as incremental cost/quality-adjusted life year for the long-term model. One-way, multiway, and probabilistic analyses were performed to address uncertainties in the model input values, and results were presented graphically in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. SETTING: Simulation of a tertiary care department in the United Kingdom. PATIENTS: A hypothetical cohort of high risk surgical patients. INTERVENTIONS: Patients undergoing high-risk surgery were stratified to receive goal-directed therapy or standard best practice to improve tissue oxygenation in the postoperative setting. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In our short-term model, goal-directed therapy decreased costs by pound2,631.77/patient and by pound2,134.86/hospital survivor. The most sensitive variables were relative risk of complication and length of stay. When assuming the worst-case scenario (prolonged ICU and in-hospital stay, highest complication costs, and maximum cost for monitoring), goal-directed therapy still achieved cost savings ( pound471.70). Our findings also predict that goal-directed therapy not only prolongs quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.83 yr or 9.8 mo) but also leads to incremental cost savings over a lifetime projection of pound1,285.77, resulting in a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of - pound1,542.16/quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSION: The implementation of goal-directed therapy is both clinical and cost-effective. Additional implementation expenditures can be offset by savings due to reduced costs accrued from a reduction in complication rates and hospital length of stay. We conclude that goal-directed therapy provides significant benefits with respect to clinical and financial outcomes.",2014-01-16945,24595219,Crit Care Med,Claudia Ebm,2014,42 / 5,1194-203,No,24595219,"Claudia Ebm; Maurizio Cecconi; Les Sutton; Andrew Rhodes; A cost-effectiveness analysis of postoperative goal-directed therapy for high-risk surgical patients, Crit Care Med, ; 42(5):0090-3493; 1194-203",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Postoperative goal-directed therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-1549.3,United Kingdom,2012,-2768.7
13626,Economic evaluation of using a genetic test to direct breast cancer chemoprevention in white women with a previous breast biopsy,"BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen therapy reduces the risk of breast cancer but increases the risk of serious adverse events including endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events. OBJECTIVES: The cost effectiveness of using a commercially available breast cancer risk assessment test (BREVAGen) to inform the decision of which women should undergo chemoprevention by tamoxifen was modeled in a simulated population of women who had undergone biopsies but had no diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: A continuous time, discrete event, mathematical model was used to simulate a population of white women aged 40-69 years, who were at elevated risk for breast cancer because of a history of benign breast biopsy. Women were assessed for clinical risk of breast cancer using the Gail model and for genetic risk using a panel of seven common single nucleotide polymorphisms. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of using genetic risk together with clinical risk, instead of clinical risk alone, to determine eligibility for 5 years of tamoxifen therapy. In addition to breast cancer, the simulation included health states of endometrial cancer, pulmonary embolism, deep-vein thrombosis, stroke, and cataract. Estimates of costs in 2012 US dollars were based on Medicare reimbursement rates reported in the literature and utilities for modeled health states were calculated as an average of utilities reported in the literature. A 50-year time horizon was used to observe lifetime effects including survival benefits. RESULTS: For those women at intermediate risk of developing breast cancer (1.2-1.66 % 5-year risk), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the combined genetic and clinical risk assessment strategy over the clinical risk assessment-only strategy was US$47,000, US$44,000, and US$65,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, for women aged 40-49, 50-59, and 60-69 years, respectively (assuming a price of US$945 for genetic testing). Results were sensitive to assumptions about patient adherence, utility of life while taking tamoxifen, and cost of genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: From the US payer''s perspective, the combined genetic and clinical risk assessment strategy may be a moderately cost-effective alternative to using clinical risk alone to guide chemoprevention recommendations for women at intermediate risk of developing breast cancer.",2014-01-16946,24595521,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Linda E Green,2014,12 / 2,203-17,Yes,24595521,"Linda E Green; Tuan A Dinh; David A Hinds; Bryan L Walser; Richard Allman; Economic evaluation of using a genetic test to direct breast cancer chemoprevention in white women with a previous breast biopsy, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, ; 12(2):1179-1896; 203-17",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Genetic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) test (BREVAGen) as risk assessment + clinical risk assessment to direct breast cancer chemoprevention vs. Standard/Usual Care- Clinical risk assessment only,undergone breast biopsies but no diagnosis of cancer,69 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,51000,United States,2012,57490.01
13627,Examining the cost-effectiveness of radiation therapy among older women with favorable-risk breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) or newer radiation therapy (RT) modalities such as intensity modulated radiation (IMRT) or brachytherapy among older women with favorable-risk breast cancer. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of no RT, EBRT, and IMRT over 10 years. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IMRT compared with EBRT under different scenarios to determine the necessary improvement in effectiveness for newer modalities to be cost-effective. We estimated model inputs using women in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database fulfilling the Cancer and Leukemia Group B C9343 trial criteria. RESULTS: The incremental cost of EBRT compared with no RT was $9500 with an ICER of $44600 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. The ICERs increased with age, ranging from $38300 (age 70-74 years) to $55800 (age 80 to 94 years) per QALY. The ICERs increased to more than $63800 per QALY for women aged 70 to 74 years with an expected 10-year survival of 25%. Reduction in local recurrence by IMRT compared with EBRT did not have a substantial impact on the ICER of IMRT. IMRT would have to increase the utility of baseline state by 20% to be cost-effective (<$100000 per QALY).

13629,Cost-effectiveness analysis of pharmaceutical treatment options in the first-line management of major depressive disorder in Belgium,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of commonly used antidepressants as first-line treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in Belgium. METHODS: The model structure was based on a decision tree developed by the Swedish TLV (Tandvards- och lakemedelsformansverket) and adapted to the Belgium healthcare setting, using primary local data on the patterns of treatment and following KCE [Federal Knowledge Center (Federaal Kenniscentrum voor de Gezondheidszorg)] recommendations. Comparators were escitalopram, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. In the model, patients not achieving remission or relapsing after remission on the assessed treatment moved to a second therapeutic step (titration, switch, add-on, or transfer to a specialist). In case of failure in the second step or following a suicide attempt, patients were assumed to be referred to secondary care. The time horizon was 1 year and the analysis was conducted from the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI; national health insurance) and societal perspectives. Remission rates were obtained from the TLV network meta-analysis and risk of relapse, efficacy following therapeutic change, risk of suicide attempts and related death, utilities, costs (2012), and resources were derived from the published literature and expert opinion. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters was estimated through scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, escitalopram was identified as the optimal strategy: it dominated all other treatments except venlafaxine from the NIHDI perspective, against which it was cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <euro>6,352 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Escitalopram also dominated all other treatments from the societal perspective. At a threshold of <euro>30,000 per QALY and from the NIHDI perspective, the PSA showed that the probability of escitalopram being identified as the optimal strategy ranged from 61 % (vs. venlafaxine) to 100 % (vs. fluoxetine).

Comparators were escitalopram, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. In the model, patients not achieving remission or relapsing after remission on the assessed treatment moved to a second therapeutic step (titration, switch, add-on, or transfer to a specialist). In case of failure in the second step or following a suicide attempt, patients were assumed to be referred to secondary care. The time horizon was 1 year and the analysis was conducted from the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance (NIHDI; national health insurance) and societal perspectives. Remission rates were obtained from the TLV network meta-analysis and risk of relapse, efficacy following therapeutic change, risk of suicide attempts and related death, utilities, costs (2012), and resources were derived from the published literature and expert opinion. The effect of uncertainty in model parameters was estimated through scenario analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, escitalopram was identified as the optimal strategy: it dominated all other treatments except venlafaxine from the NIHDI perspective, against which it was cost effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of <euro>6,352 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Escitalopram also dominated all other treatments from the societal perspective. At a threshold of <euro>30,000 per QALY and from the NIHDI perspective, the PSA showed that the probability of escitalopram being identified as the optimal strategy ranged from 61 % (vs. venlafaxine) to 100 % (vs. fluoxetine). CONCLUSION: Escitalopram was associated with the highest probability of being the optimal treatment from the NIHDI and societal perspectives.

13636,Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion vs. posterolateral instrumented fusion: cost-utility evaluation along side an RCT with a 2-year follow-up,"PURPOSE: Long-lasting low back pain is an increasing problem, and for some patients surgery is the final option for improvement. Several techniques for spinal fusion are available and the optimal technique remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) compared to posterolateral instrumented fusion (PLF) from the societal perspective. METHODS: 100 Patients were randomized to TLIF or PLF (51/49) and followed for 2 years. Cost data were acquired from national registers, and outcomes were measured using the Oswestry Disability Index and SF-6D questionnaires. Conventional cost-effectiveness methodology was employed to estimate net benefit and to illustrate cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. The statistical analysis was based on means and bootstrapped confidence intervals. RESULTS: Results showed no statistically significant difference in either cost or effects although a tendency for the TLIF regimen being more costly on bed days (<euro>2,554) and production loss (<euro>1,915) was observed. The probability that TLIF would be cost-effective did not exceed 30 % for any threshold of willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis was conducted and supported the statistical model for handling of missing data.

13637,Cost-effectiveness of childhood rotavirus vaccination in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Rotavirus (RV) causes a highly contagious gastroenteritis especially in children under five years of age. Since 2006 two RV-vaccines are available in Europe (Rotarix((R)) and RotaTeq((R))). To support informed decision-making within the German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO) the cost-effectiveness of these two vaccines was evaluated for the German healthcare setting. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness from the statutory health insurance (SHI) and from the societal perspective. RV-cases prevented, RV-associated hospitalizations avoided, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained were considered as health outcomes. RV-incidences were calculated based on data from the national mandatory disease reporting system. RV-vaccine efficacy was determined as pooled estimates based on data from randomized controlled trials. Vaccine list prices and price catalogues were used for cost-assessment. Effects and costs were discounted with an annual discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: The base-case analysis (SHI-perspective) resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratio for Rotarix((R)) of euro 184 per RV-case prevented, euro 2457 per RV-associated hospitalization avoided, and euro 116,973 per QALY gained. For RotaTeq((R)), the results were euro 234 per RV-case prevented, euro 2622 per RV-associated hospitalization avoided, and euro 142,732 per QALY gained. Variation of various parameters in sensitivity analyses showed effects on the ICERs without changing the overall trend of base-case results. When applying base-case results to the 2012 birthcohort in Germany with 80% vaccination coverage, an estimated 206,000-242,000 RV-cases and 18,000 RV-associated hospitalizations can be prevented in this birthcohort over five years for an incremental cost of 44.5-48.2 million euro. CONCLUSION: Our analyses demonstrate that routine RV-vaccination could prevent a substantial number of RV-cases and hospitalizations in the German healthcare system, but the saved treatment costs are counteracted by costs for vaccination. However, with vaccine prices reduced by approximately 62-66%, RV-vaccination could even become a cost-saving preventive measure.",2014-01-16976,24561052,Vaccine,Pamela Aidelsburger,2014,32 / 17,1964-74,Yes,24561052,"Pamela Aidelsburger; Kristin Grabein; Katharina Bohm; Markus Dietl; Jurgen Wasem; Judith Koch; Bernhard Ultsch; Felix Weidemann; Ole Wichmann; Cost-effectiveness of childhood rotavirus vaccination in Germany, Vaccine, ; 32(17):1873-2518; 1964-74",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Rotatrix vaccination strategy vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,0 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,116973,Euro,2011,187288.51

13639,Comparative survival and cost-effectiveness of advanced therapies for end-stage heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Treatment options for end-stage heart failure include inotrope-dependent medical therapy, orthotopic heart transplantation (OHT), left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as destination therapy or bridge to transplant. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a state-transition model to simulate 4 treatment options and associated morbidity and mortality. Transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from published sources. Calculated outcomes included survival, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness. Sensitivity analyses were performed on model parameters to test robustness. Average life expectancy for OHT-eligible patients is estimated at 1.1 years, with 39% surviving to 1 year. OHT with a median wait time of 5.6 months is estimated to increase life expectancy to 8.5 years, and costs <$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained, relative to inotrope-dependent medical therapy. Bridge to transplant-LVAD followed by OHT further is estimated to increase life expectancy to 12.3 years, for $226,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained versus OHT. Among OHT-ineligible patients, mean life expectancy with inotrope-dependent medical therapy is estimated at 9.4 months, with 26% surviving to 1 year. Patients who instead received destination therapy-LVAD are estimated to live 4.4 years on average from extrapolation of recent constant hazard rates beyond the first year. This strategy costs $202,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained, relative to inotrope-dependent medical therapy. Patient''s age, time on wait list, and costs associated with care influence outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Under most scenarios, OHT prolongs life and is cost effective in eligible patients. Bridge to transplant-LVAD is estimated to offer >3.8 additional life-years for patients waiting >/=6 months, but does not meet conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds.

13641,Cost-effectiveness of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: Asenapine is the first tetracyclic antipsychotic approved in Canada for the treatment of schizophrenia (SCZ). Asenapine has shown a comparable efficacy profile to other atypical antipsychotics and it is associated with a favourable metabolic profile and less weight gain. This study aimed to assess the economic impact of asenapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of SCZ in Canada. METHODS: A decision tree combined with a Markov model was constructed to assess the cost-utility of asenapine compared with other atypical antipsychotics. The decision tree takes into account the occurrence of extrapyramidal symptoms, the probability of switching to a different antipsychotic, and the probability of gaining weight. The Markov model takes into account long-term metabolic complications including diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart diseases, and stroke. In the base-case analysis, asenapine was compared to olanzapine. Asenapine was also compared with other atypical antipsychotics commonly used in Canada in alternative scenarios. Analyses were conducted from both Canadian Ministry of Health (MoH) and societal perspectives over a 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: In the treatment of SCZ, asenapine is a dominant strategy over olanzapine from both MoH and societal perspectives. Compared to quetiapine, asenapine is also a dominant strategy. Furthermore, asenapine has a favorable economic impact compared to ziprasidone and aripiprazole, as these antipsychotics are not cost-effective compared to asenapine from both MoH and societal perspectives. CONCLUSION: Despite the short time horizon, the lack of compliance data and the assumptions made, this economic evaluation demonstrates that asenapine is a cost-effective strategy compared to olanzapine and to most of the atypical antipsychotics frequently used in Canada.",2014-01-16980,24564402,J Med Econ,Jean Lachaine,2014,17 / 4,296-304,Yes,24564402,"Jean Lachaine; Catherine Beauchemin; Karine Mathurin; Dominique Gilbert; Maud Beillat; Cost-effectiveness of asenapine in the treatment of schizophrenia in Canada, J Med Econ, ; 17(4):1369-6998; 296-304",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Asenapine vs. Olanzapine,Not Stated,Not Stated,40 Years,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,-156234.95,Canada,2011,-181822.07
13642,The cost effectiveness of biologic therapy for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in real practice settings in Italy,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Biologic therapies are considered to be cost effective by leading Health Technology Assessment (HTA) agencies and, therefore, eligible for reimbursement by public health services. However, biologic therapies entail sizable incremental costs and, besides, have a considerable financial impact that in Italy amounts to 13.7 % of the national health service''s pharmaceutical expenditure. In the reimbursability decision process, an important role is played by both the drug efficacy data observed in pre-licensing RCTs and the economic modelling assumptions, as they give evidence on cost effectiveness. The administration of therapies in real practice settings is likely to produce a significant deviation from the results predicted by the models, theoretically outweighing the assumption on which the decision process is founded. This is a matter of concern for public health services and, consequently, an interesting topic to investigate. METHODS: To overcome the lack of knowledge concerning the actual cost effectiveness of biologic therapies for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in the clinical practice setting in Italy, an observational study was conducted in 12 specialist centres on patients switching to biologic therapy within a 6-month enrolment window. RESULTS: The study confirms in clinical practice the efficacy of the switch to biologic therapies, analysed using a number of clinical [Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and itching VAS] and quality-of-life parameters. A general health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) improvement, with a 0.23 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) mean gain per patient, has been reported in the 6-month observation period. The direct medical costs to treat plaque psoriasis with biologic therapies amount to <euro>15,073.7 per year (prior to their enrolment, the same patients cost <euro>2,166.2 on an annual basis).

However, biologic therapies entail sizable incremental costs and, besides, have a considerable financial impact that in Italy amounts to 13.7 % of the national health service''s pharmaceutical expenditure. In the reimbursability decision process, an important role is played by both the drug efficacy data observed in pre-licensing RCTs and the economic modelling assumptions, as they give evidence on cost effectiveness. The administration of therapies in real practice settings is likely to produce a significant deviation from the results predicted by the models, theoretically outweighing the assumption on which the decision process is founded. This is a matter of concern for public health services and, consequently, an interesting topic to investigate. METHODS: To overcome the lack of knowledge concerning the actual cost effectiveness of biologic therapies for the treatment of plaque psoriasis in the clinical practice setting in Italy, an observational study was conducted in 12 specialist centres on patients switching to biologic therapy within a 6-month enrolment window. RESULTS: The study confirms in clinical practice the efficacy of the switch to biologic therapies, analysed using a number of clinical [Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), pain visual analogue scale (VAS) and itching VAS] and quality-of-life parameters.

13646,Cost effectiveness of fesoterodine and tolterodine for the treatment of overactive bladder with urge urinary incontinence in Spain and Finland,"BACKGROUND: Overactive bladder is a prevalent condition worldwide that is associated with a considerable burden, both on the patient and on society. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to assess the economic value of fesoterodine compared with tolterodine extended release (ER) for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with urge urinary incontinence (UUI) in Spain and Finland. METHODS: A decision-tree economic model estimated the 52-week costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of OAB/UUI patients initiating treatment with fesoterodine 4 mg/day or tolterodine ER. Individuals were evaluated for treatment response (UUI fewer than one episode/day) and persistence at weeks 4, 12, and 24. Titration from fesoterodine 4 mg/day to 8 mg/day was permitted at week 4. At week 12, non-responders discontinued treatment permanently. Efficacy, discontinuation, and utility data were derived from four clinical trials of fesoterodine. OAB-related costs, including physician visits, laboratory tests, incontinence pads, and comorbidities (fracture, skin infection, urinary tract infections, depression, and nursing home) were also included. RESULTS: A total of 19.5 % and 18.0 % of fesoterodine and tolterodine ER patients remained on treatment until week 52, respectively. QALYs were higher with fesoterodine than tolterodine ER (0.762 vs. 0.760). In Spain, fesoterodine treatment had higher total costs than (generic) tolterodine ER (euro6,697 vs. 6,597), resulting in a cost of euro15,633/QALY gained. In Finland, fesoterodine was cost saving relative to (non-generic) tolterodine ER (euro7,885 vs. 8,024). Sensitivity analysis confirmed that these findings were robust to the expected price decrease for generic tolterodine ER in Finland.

13648,Cost effectiveness of EML4-ALK fusion testing and first-line crizotinib treatment for patients with advanced ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer,"PURPOSE: ALK-targeted therapy with crizotinib offers significant improvement in clinical outcomes for the treatment of EML4-ALK fusion-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We estimated the cost effectiveness of EML4-ALK fusion testing in combination with targeted first-line crizotinib treatment in Ontario. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted using a Markov model from the Canadian Public health (Ontario) perspective and a lifetime horizon in patients with stage IV NSCLC with nonsquamous histology. Transition probabilities and mortality rates were calculated from the Ontario Cancer Registry and Cancer Care Ontario New Drug Funding Program (CCO NDFP). Costs were obtained from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative, CCO NDFP, University Health Network, and literature. RESULTS: Molecular testing with first-line targeted crizotinib treatment in the population with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC resulted in a gain of 0.011 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with standard care. The incremental cost was Canadian $2,725 per patient, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $255,970 per QALY gained. Among patients with known EML4-ALK-positive advanced NSCLC, first-line crizotinib therapy provided 0.379 additional QALYs, cost an additional $95,043 compared with standard care, and produced an ICER of $250,632 per QALY gained. The major driver of cost effectiveness was drug price.

13649,A cost-utility analysis of degarelix in the treatment of advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of the treatment of advanced hormone-dependent prostate cancer with degarelix compared to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists in the UK using the latest available evidence and the model submitted to AWMSG. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed from the perspective of the UK National Health Service evaluating monthly injection of degarelix against 3-monthly leuprorelin therapy plus anti-androgen flare cover for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced (locally advanced or metastatic) hormone-dependent prostate cancer. A Markov process model was constructed using the patient population characteristics and efficacy information from the CS21 Phase III clinical trial and associated extension study (CS21A). The intention-to-treat (ITT) population and a high-risk sub-group with a PSA level >20 ng/mL were modeled. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis using the patient access scheme (PAS) price, degarelix was dominant compared to leuprorelin with cost savings of pound3633 in the ITT population and pound4310 in the PSA > 20 ng/mL sub-group. The chance of being cost-effective was 95% in the ITT population and 96% in the PSA > 20 ng/mL sub-group at a threshold of pound20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). In addition, degarelix remained dominant when PSA progression was assumed equal and only the benefits of preventing testosterone flare were taken into account. Treatment with degarelix also remained dominant in both populations when the list price was used. The additional investment required to treat patients with degarelix could be offset in 19 months for the ITT population and 13 months for the PSA > 20 ng/mL population. The model was most sensitive to the hazard ratio assumed for PSA progression between degarelix and leuprorelin and the quality-of-life (utility) of patients receiving palliative care.

13653,Modeling the impact of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Chinese infants: an economic analysis of a compulsory vaccination,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare, from a Chinese societal perspective, the projected health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of adding pneumococcal conjugate heptavalent vaccine (PCV-7) to the routine compulsory child immunization schedule. METHODS: A decision-tree model, with data and assumptions adapted for relevance to China, was developed to project the health outcomes of PCV-7 vaccination (compared with no vaccination) over a 5-year period as well as a lifetime. The vaccinated birth cohort included 16,000,000 children in China. A 2 + 1 dose schedule at US$136.51 per vaccine dose was used in the base-case analysis. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to test the robustness of the model. The impact of a net indirect effect (herd immunity) was evaluated. Outcomes are presented in terms of the saved disease burden, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: In a Chinese birth cohort, a PCV-7 vaccination program would reduce the number of pneumococcus-related infections by at least 32% and would prevent 2,682 deaths in the first 5 years of life, saving $1,190 million in total costs and gaining an additional 9,895 QALYs (discounted by 3%). The incremental cost per QALY was estimated to be $530,354. When herd immunity was taken into account, the cost per QALY was estimated to be $95,319. The robustness of the model was influenced mainly by the PCV-7 cost per dose, effectiveness herd immunity and incidence of pneumococcal diseases. With and without herd immunity, the break-even costs in China were $29.05 and $25.87, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compulsory routine infant vaccination with PCV-7 is projected to substantially reduce pneumococcal disease morbidity, mortality, and related costs in China. However, a universal vaccination program with PCV-7 is not cost-effective at the willingness-to-pay threshold that is currently recommended for China by the World Health Organization.",2014-01-16991,24507480,BMC Health Serv Res,Datian Che,2014,14 /,56,Yes,24507480,"Datian Che; Hua Zhou; Jinchun He; Bin Wu; Modeling the impact of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Chinese infants: an economic analysis of a compulsory vaccination, BMC Health Serv Res, ; 14():1472-6963; 56",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine- Prevnar vs. None,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,530354,United States,2011,610216.32
13654,Cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus other new oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Apixaban (5 mg BID), dabigatran (available as 150 mg and 110 mg BID in Europe), and rivaroxaban (20 mg once daily) are 3 novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) currently approved for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of apixaban against other NOACs from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of apixaban versus other NOACs over a lifetime. Pair-wise indirect treatment comparisons were conducted against other NOACs by using ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation), RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), and ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) trial results for the following end points: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeds, myocardial infarction, and treatment discontinuations. Outcomes were life-years, quality-adjusted life years gained, direct health care costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to increase life expectancy versus other NOACs, including dabigatran (both doses) and rivaroxaban. A small increase in therapeutic management costs was observed with apixaban due to projected gains in life expectancy and lower discontinuation rates anticipated on apixaban versus other NOACs through lifetime. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound9611, pound4497, and pound5305 per quality-adjusted life-year gained with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust over a wide range of inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis was limited by the absence of head-to-head trials, based on the indirect comparison data available, our model projects that apixaban may be a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for stroke prevention in AF patients from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services.",2014-01-16994,24508420,Clin Ther,Gregory Y H Lip,2014,36 / 2,192-210.e20,Yes,24508420,"Gregory Y H Lip; Thitima Kongnakorn; Hemant Phatak; Andreas Kuznik; Tereza Lanitis; Larry Z Liu; Uchenna Iloeje; Luis Hernandez; Paul Dorian; Cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus other new oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, Clin Ther, ; 36(2):1879-114X; 192-210.e20",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Dabigatran (110 mg BID),Not Stated,Not Stated,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,4497,United Kingdom,2011,8300.93

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic impact of apixaban versus other NOACs over a lifetime. Pair-wise indirect treatment comparisons were conducted against other NOACs by using ARISTOTLE (Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation), RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), and ROCKET-AF (Rivaroxaban Once Daily Oral Direct Factor Xa Inhibition Compared With Vitamin K Antagonism for Prevention of Stroke and Embolism Trial in Atrial Fibrillation) trial results for the following end points: ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, other major bleeds, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeds, myocardial infarction, and treatment discontinuations. Outcomes were life-years, quality-adjusted life years gained, direct health care costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Apixaban was projected to increase life expectancy versus other NOACs, including dabigatran (both doses) and rivaroxaban. A small increase in therapeutic management costs was observed with apixaban due to projected gains in life expectancy and lower discontinuation rates anticipated on apixaban versus other NOACs through lifetime. The estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was pound9611, pound4497, and pound5305 per quality-adjusted life-year gained with apixaban compared with dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that results were robust over a wide range of inputs. CONCLUSIONS: Although our analysis was limited by the absence of head-to-head trials, based on the indirect comparison data available, our model projects that apixaban may be a cost-effective alternative to dabigatran 150 mg BID, dabigatran 110 mg BID, and rivaroxaban 20 mg once daily for stroke prevention in AF patients from the perspective of the United Kingdom National Health Services.",2014-01-16994,24508420,Clin Ther,Gregory Y H Lip,2014,36 / 2,192-210.e20,Yes,24508420,"Gregory Y H Lip; Thitima Kongnakorn; Hemant Phatak; Andreas Kuznik; Tereza Lanitis; Larry Z Liu; Uchenna Iloeje; Luis Hernandez; Paul Dorian; Cost-effectiveness of apixaban versus other new oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, Clin Ther, ; 36(2):1879-114X; 192-210.e20",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Apixaban vs. Dabigatran (150 mg BID),Not Stated,Not Stated,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,9611,United Kingdom,2011,17740.78

13657,"Cost-effectiveness of initial stress cardiovascular MR, stress SPECT or stress echocardiography as a gate-keeper test, compared with upfront invasive coronary angiography in the investigation and management of patients with stable chest pain: mid-term outcomes from the CECaT randomised controlled t","OBJECTIVES: To compare outcomes and cost-effectiveness of various initial imaging strategies in the management of stable chest pain in a long-term prospective randomised trial. SETTING: Regional cardiothoracic referral centre in the east of England. PARTICIPANTS: 898 patients (69% man) entered the study with 869 alive at 2 years of follow-up. Patients were included if they presented for assessment of stable chest pain with a positive exercise test and no prior history of ischaemic heart disease. Exclusion criteria were recent infarction, unstable symptoms or any contraindication to stress MRI. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes of this follow-up study were survival up to a minimum of 2 years post-treatment, quality-adjusted survival and cost-utility of each strategy. RESULTS: 898 patients were randomised. Compared with angiography, mortality was marginally higher in the groups randomised to cardiac MR (HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 6.2), but similar in the single photon emission CT-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (SPECT-MIBI; HR 1.0, 95% CI 0.4 to 2.9) and ECHO groups (HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.6 to 4.0). Although SPECT-MIBI was marginally superior to other non-invasive tests there were no other significant differences between the groups in mortality, quality-adjusted survival or costs. CONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive cardiac imaging can be used safely as the initial diagnostic test to diagnose coronary artery disease without adverse effects on patient outcomes or increased costs, relative to angiography. These results should be interpreted in the context of recent advances in imaging technology.

13660,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of immediate versus delayed treatment of hepatitis C virus-infected patients in a country with limited resources: the case of Egypt,"BACKGROUND: Because of logistical and economic issues, in Egypt, as in other resource-limited settings, decision makers should determine for which patients hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment should be prioritized. We assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different treatment initiation strategies. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we simulated HCV disease in chronically infected patients in Egypt, to compare lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of different treatment initiation strategies. RESULTS: Immediate treatment of patients at stages F1/F2/F3 was less expensive and more effective than delaying treatment until more severe stages or not providing treatment (in patients diagnosed at F1: QALE = 18.32 years if treatment at F1 vs 18.22 if treatment at F2). Treatment of F4 patients was more effective than no treatment at all (QALE = 10.33 years vs 8.77 years) and was cost-effective (ICER = $1915/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). When considering that affordable triple therapies, including new direct-acting antivirals, will be available starting in 2016, delaying treatment until stage F2, then treating all patients regardless of their disease stage after 2016, was found to be cost-effective (ICER = $33/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: In Egypt, immediate treatment of patients with fibrosis stage F1-F3 who present to care is less expensive and more effective than delaying treatment. However, immediate treatment at stage F1 is only slightly more effective than waiting for disease to progress to stage F2 before starting treatment and is sensitive to the forthcoming availability of new treatments.

13666,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of immediate versus delayed treatment of hepatitis C virus-infected patients in a country with limited resources: the case of Egypt,"BACKGROUND: Because of logistical and economic issues, in Egypt, as in other resource-limited settings, decision makers should determine for which patients hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment should be prioritized. We assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different treatment initiation strategies. METHODS: Using a Markov model, we simulated HCV disease in chronically infected patients in Egypt, to compare lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of different treatment initiation strategies. RESULTS: Immediate treatment of patients at stages F1/F2/F3 was less expensive and more effective than delaying treatment until more severe stages or not providing treatment (in patients diagnosed at F1: QALE = 18.32 years if treatment at F1 vs 18.22 if treatment at F2). Treatment of F4 patients was more effective than no treatment at all (QALE = 10.33 years vs 8.77 years) and was cost-effective (ICER = $1915/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). When considering that affordable triple therapies, including new direct-acting antivirals, will be available starting in 2016, delaying treatment until stage F2, then treating all patients regardless of their disease stage after 2016, was found to be cost-effective (ICER = $33/QALY). CONCLUSIONS: In Egypt, immediate treatment of patients with fibrosis stage F1-F3 who present to care is less expensive and more effective than delaying treatment. However, immediate treatment at stage F1 is only slightly more effective than waiting for disease to progress to stage F2 before starting treatment and is sensitive to the forthcoming availability of new treatments.

13667,Economic evaluation of rivaroxaban in stroke prevention for patients with atrial fibrillation in Greece,"BACKGROUND: To undertake an economic evaluation of rivaroxaban relative to the standard of care for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) in Greece. METHODS: An existing Markov model designed to reflect the natural progression of AF patients through different health states, in the course of three month cycles, was adapted to the Greek setting. The analysis was undertaken from a payer perspective. Baseline event rates and efficacy data were obtained from the ROCKET-AF trial for rivaroxaban and vitamin-K-antagonists (VKAs). Utility values for events were based on literature. A treatment-related disutility of 0.05 was applied to the VKA arm. Costs assigned to each health state reflect the year 2013. An incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated where the outcome was quality-adjusted-life year (QALY) and life-years gained. Probabilistic analysis was undertaken to deal with uncertainty. The horizon of analysis was over patient life time and both cost and outcomes were discounted at 3.5%. RESULTS: Based on safety-on-treatment data, rivaroxaban was associated with a 0.22 increment in QALYs compared to VKA. The average total lifetime cost of rivaroxaban-treated patients was euro239 lower compared to VKA. Rivaroxaban was associated with additional drug acquisition cost (euro4,033) and reduced monitoring cost (-euro3,929). Therefore, rivaroxaban was a dominant alternative over VKA. Probabilistic analysis revealed that there is a 100% probability of rivaroxaban being cost-effective versus VKA at a willingness to pay threshold of euro30,000/QALY gained.

Aspirin is recommended for low-risk patients and those unsuitable for warfarin. Apixaban is an oral anticoagulant that has demonstrated better efficacy than warfarin and aspirin in the ARISTOTLE and AVERROES studies, respectively, and causes less bleeding than warfarin. We evaluated the potential cost-effectiveness of apixaban against warfarin and aspirin from the perspective of the UK payer perspective.

13670,Cost-effectiveness in Canada of azacitidine for the treatment of higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes,"OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to determine the economic value of azacitidine in Canada compared with conventional care regimens (ccrs), including best supportive care (bsc) and low- or standard-dose chemotherapy plus bsc in the treatment of higher-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (mdss) and acute myeloid leukemia (aml) with 20%-30% blasts. METHODS: The cost-utility model is a lifetime probabilistic Markov model with a 35-day cycle length consisting of 3 health states: mds; transformation to aml with more than 30% blasts; and death. A third-party public payer perspective was adopted. Overall survival was extrapolated beyond the time horizon of the aza-001 trial comparing azacitidine with ccr. Resource use was determined through a questionnaire completed by Canadian hematologists. Utility values were obtained from two studies in which EQ-5D health questionnaire values were mapped from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer qlq-C30 survey, and SF-6D scores were mapped from the Short Form 12, elicited from 191 and 43 patients in two different trials. RESULTS: In the base case, azacitidine had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) of $86,182 (95% confidence limits: $69,920, $107,157) per quality-adjusted life year (qaly) gained relative to ccr. Comparing azacitidine with bsc, low-dose chemotherapy plus bsc, and standard-dose chemotherapy plus bsc, the icers were, respectively, $86,973, $84,829, and $2,152 per qaly gained. Results were most sensitive to the utility for azacitidine after 6 months of treatment and to overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The prolonged 9-month median overall survival with azacitidine relative to ccr fills a gap w hen treating patients with higher-risk mds and aml with 20%-30% blasts.

13671,Cost-effectiveness of folfirinox for first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer,"BACKGROUND: The accord 11/0402 trial demonstrated that folfirinox (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) is significantly more efficacious than gemcitabine monotherapy in the first-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer (mpc). The present study assessed the cost-effectiveness of first-line folfirinox compared with first-line gemcitabine for public payers in Canada. METHODS: A Markov model simulated the movement of mpc patients from first-line treatment until death. Overall survival (os) and progression-free survival (pfs) data were derived from accord. Published utility data and Canadian costs were applied based on time in each health state and on treatment-related adverse event (ae) rates. Costs included first- and second-line therapy, monitoring, and costs to treat aes. Two separate analyses were performed. Analysis 1 was based on trial data [first-line folfirinox followed by second-line gemcitabine compared with first-line gemcitabine followed by second-line platinum-based chemotherapy, with use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (g-csf) allowed], and analysis 2 used Ontario treatment patterns before folfirinox funding (first-line folfirinox followed by second-line gemcitabine compared with first-line gemcitabine followed by best supportive care, no use of g-csf). RESULTS: Compared with first-line gemcitabine, first-line folfirinox resulted in more life-years and quality adjusted life-years (qalys).

13673,Cost-utility analysis comparing heavy-weight and light-weight mesh in laparoscopic surgery for unilateral inguinal hernias,"BACKGROUND: Hernioplasty is one of the most frequent surgeries in the UK. Light-weight mesh (LWM) has the potential to reduce chronic groin pain but its cost-effectiveness compared with heavy-weight mesh (HWM) is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a cost-utility analysis between laparoscopic hernioplasty with HWM and LWM for unilateral inguinal hernias. METHODS: A Markov model simulated costs and health outcomes over a period of 1 year (2012) from the societal and National Health Service (NHS) perspective (England). The main outcome was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Surgery results were gleaned from the randomized control trial by Bittner et al. Other input parameters were drawn from the literature and public sources of the NHS. RESULTS: From the societal perspective, LWM induces lower incremental costs (- pound88.85) than HWM but yields a slightly smaller incremental effect (-0.00094 QALYs). The deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for HWM compared with LWM amounts to pound94,899 per QALY, while the probabilistic ICER is pound118,750 (95 % confidence interval [CI] pound57,603-180,920). Owing to the withdrawal of productivity losses from the NHS perspective, LWM causes higher incremental costs ( pound13.09) and an inferior incremental effect (-0.00093), resulting in a dominance of HWM over LWM (ICER 95 % CI - pound12,382 to - pound21,590). CONCLUSIONS: There is no support for the adoption of LWM as standard treatment from an NHS perspective.

13674,Health impact and economic analysis of NGO-supported neurosurgery in Bolivia,"OBJECT: Bolivia, one of the poorest countries in the world, ranks 108th on the 2013 Human Development Index. With approximately 1 neurosurgeon per 200,000 people, access to neurosurgery in Bolivia is a growing health concern. Furthermore, neurosurgery in nonindustrialized countries has been considered both cost-prohibitive and lacking in outcomes evaluation. A non-governmental organization (NGO) supports spinal procedures in Bolivia (Solidarity Bridge), and the authors sought to determine its impact and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: In a retrospective review of prospectively collected data, 19 patients were identified prior to spinal instrumentation and followed over 12 months. For inclusion, patients required interviewing prior to surgery and during at least 2 follow-up visits. All causes of spinal pathology were included. Sixteen patients met inclusion criteria and were therefore part of the analysis. Outcomes measured included assessment of activities of daily living, pain, ambulation, return to work/school, and satisfaction. Cost-effectiveness was determined by cost-utility analysis. Utilities were derived using the Health Utilities Index. Complications were incorporated into an expected value decision tree. RESULTS: Median (+/- SD) preoperative satisfaction was 2.0 +/- 0.3 (on a scale of 0-10), while 6-month postoperative satisfaction was 7 +/- 1.4 (p < 0.0001). Ambulation, pain, and emotional disability data suggested marked improvement (56%, 69%, and 63%, respectively; p = 0.035, 0.003, and 0.006). Total discounted incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain was 0.771. The total discounted cost equaled $9036 (95% CI $8561-$10,740) at 2 years. Computing the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio resulted in a value of $11,720/QALY, ranging from $9220 to $15,473/QALY in a univariate sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This NGO-supported spinal instrumentation program in Bolivia appears to be cost-effective, especially when compared with the conventional $50,000/QALY benchmark and the WHO endorsed country-specific threshold of $16,026/QALY. However, with a gross domestic product per capita in Bolivia equaling $4800 per year and 30.3% of the population living on less than $2 per day, this cost continues to appear unrealistic. Additionally, the study has several significant limitations, namely its limited sample size, follow-up period, the assumption that patients not receiving surgical intervention would not make any clinical improvement, the reliance on the NGO for patient selection and sustainable practices such as follow-up care and ancillary services, and the lack of a randomized prospective design. These limitations, as well as an unclear understanding of Bolivian willingness-to-pay data, affect the generalizability of the study findings and impede widespread economic policy reform. Because cost-effectiveness research may inevitably direct care decisions and prove that an effort such as this can be cost saving, a prospective, properly controlled investigation is now warranted.",2014-01-17020,24527825,J Neurosurg Spine,Jared D Ament,2014,20 / 4,436-42,No,24527825,"Jared D Ament; Kevin R Greene; Ivan Flores; Fernando Capobianco; Gueider Salas; Maria Ines Uriona; John P Weaver; Richard Moser; Health impact and economic analysis of NGO-supported neurosurgery in Bolivia, J Neurosurg Spine, ; 20(4):1547-5654; 436-42",QALY,Bolivia,Not Stated,Not Stated,A non-governmental organization supports spinal procedures vs. None,Not Stated,64 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,3.00,3.00,11720,United States,2011,13484.83
13675,Clinical and economic evaluation of tapentadol extended release and oxycodone/naloxone extended release in comparison with controlled release oxycodone in musculoskeletal pain,"OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability and represents a relevant societal burden. Opioids are widely used for managing chronic non-cancer pain; however, the high incidence of side effects is often the main reason for discontinuation. Two formulations have recently been studied to improve the tolerability of opioids (tapentadol extended release [ER] and oxycodone/naloxone ER), but a direct comparison between these drugs is not available in the literature. The comparative cost effectiveness of these two drugs has not previously been assessed. The objective of this meta-analysis is a clinical and economic evaluation of tapentadol ER and oxycodone/naloxone ER for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain, by indirect comparison with controlled release (CR) oxycodone. METHODS: A structured literature review was conducted to identify published data for the health-economic model. The authors performed a meta-analysis on three selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for each treatment (tapentadol ER and oxycodone/naloxone ER). As measure of treatment effect, risk ratio was calculated, compared to the control active treatment (CR oxycodone), for the following outcomes: discontinuation rate due to adverse events, due to gastrointestinal (GE) side effects and central nervous system (CNS) side effects. A Markov model was developed to compare the cost effectiveness of tapentadol ER and oxycodone/naloxone ER. Four health states were defined: (1) patients still on treatment; (2) occurrence of adverse events (gastroenterology, central nervous system); (3) treatment discontinuation as consequence of ineffectiveness of treatment; and (4) treatment discontinuation as consequence of adverse events. RESULTS: Both drugs showed a significant clinical advantage over the active control, CR oxycodone; however, tapentadol ER resulted in a better risk ratio reduction for the primary outcome of discontinuation rate due to adverse events and for the secondary outcome nausea and vomiting. The two drugs gave equivalent results in the capacity of reduction of constipation risk. In the economic evaluation both interventions were cost effective compared with CR oxycodone. However, tapentadol ER showed the most favorable results as in 65% of cases it was less costly and produced a considerable quality adjusted life years (QALY) gain. The higher impact of tapentadol ER on the cost effectiveness results was probably due to the price and the lower incidence of adverse events and related discontinuation rate, resulting in a further economic advantage. CONCLUSION: Both tapentadol ER and oxycodone/naloxone ER are cost effective interventions compared with CR oxycodone; however, tapentadol ER was shown to provide better clinical outcomes at lower costs.",2014-01-17021,24528146,Curr Med Res Opin,Flaminia Coluzzi,2014,30 / 6,1139-51,No,24528146,"Flaminia Coluzzi; Matteo Ruggeri; Clinical and economic evaluation of tapentadol extended release and oxycodone/naloxone extended release in comparison with controlled release oxycodone in musculoskeletal pain, Curr Med Res Opin, ; 30(6):0300-7995; 1139-51",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tapentado vs. Oxycodone treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,1 Year,3.00,3.00,-100.33,Euro,2012,-145.42
13676,Cost-effectiveness of a universal strategy of brief dietary intervention for primary prevention in primary care: population-based cohort study and Markov model,"BACKGROUND: A healthy diet is associated with reduced risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer. The study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a universal strategy to promote healthy diet through brief intervention in primary care. METHODS: The research was informed by a systematic review of randomised trials which found that brief interventions in primary care may be associated with a 0.5 portion per day increase in fruit and vegetable consumption. A Markov model that included five long-term conditions (diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, colorectal cancer and depression) was developed. Empirical data from a large cohort of United Kingdom-based participants sampled from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink populated the model. Simulations compared an intervention promoting healthy diet over 5 years in healthy adults, and standard care in which there was no intervention. The annual cost of intervention, in the base case, was one family practice consultation per participant year. Health service costs were included and the model adopted a lifetime perspective. The primary outcome was net health benefit in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: A cohort of 262,704 healthy participants entered the model. Intervention was associated with an increase in life years lived free from physical disease of 41.9 (95% confidence interval -17.4 to 101.0) per 1,000 participants entering the model (probability of increase 88.0%). New incidences of disease states were reduced by 28.4 (18.7 to 75.8) per 1,000, probability reduced 84.6%. Discounted incremental QALYs were 4.3 (-8.8 to 18.0) per 1,000, while incremental costs were pound139,755 ( pound60,466 to 220,059) per 1,000. Net health benefits at pound30,000 per QALY were -0.32 (-13.8 to 13.5) QALYs per 1,000 participants (probability cost-effective 47.9%). When the intervention was restricted to adults aged 50 to 74 years, net health benefits were 2.94 (-21.3 to 26.4) QALYs per 1000, probability increased 59.0%. CONCLUSIONS: A universal strategy to promote healthy diet through brief intervention in primary care is unlikely to be cost-effective, even when delivered at low unit cost.

13677,Cost-effectiveness of a programme of screening and brief interventions for alcohol in primary care in Italy,"BACKGROUND: As alcohol-related health problems continue to rise, the attention of policy-makers is increasingly turning to Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) programmes. The effectiveness of such programmes in primary healthcare is well evidenced, but very few cost-effectiveness analyses have been conducted and none which specifically consider the Italian context. METHODS: The Sheffield Alcohol Policy Model has been used to model the cost-effectiveness of government pricing and public health policies in several countries including England. This study adapts the model using Italian data to evaluate a programme of screening and brief interventions in Italy. Results are reported as Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs) of SBI programmes versus a ''do-nothing'' scenario. RESULTS: Model results show such programmes to be highly cost-effective, with estimated ICERs of euro550/Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained for a programme of SBI at next GP registration and euro590/QALY for SBI at next GP consultation. A range of sensitivity analyses suggest these results are robust under all but the most pessimistic assumptions.

13678,Cost-utility analysis of prehospital spine immobilization recommendations for penetrating trauma,"BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons'' Committee on Trauma''s recent prehospital trauma life support recommendations against prehospital spine immobilization (PHSI) after penetrating trauma are based on a low incidence of unstable spine injuries after penetrating injuries. However, given the chronic and costly nature of devastating spine injuries, the cost-utility of PHSI is unclear. Our hypothesis was that the cost-utility of PHSI in penetrating trauma precludes routine use of this prevention strategy. METHODS: A Markov model based cost-utility analysis was performed from a society perspective of a hypothetical cohort of 20-year-old males presenting with penetrating trauma and transported to a US hospital. The analysis compared PHSI with observation alone. The probabilities of spine injuries, costs (US 2010 dollars), and utility of the two groups were derived from published studies and public data. Incremental effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years. Subset analyses of isolated head and neck injuries as well as sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the strength of the recommendations. RESULTS: Only 0.2% of penetrating trauma produced unstable spine injury, and only 7.4% of the patients with unstable spine injury who underwent spine stabilization had neurologic improvement. The total lifetime per-patient cost was $930,446 for the PHSI group versus $929,883 for the nonimmobilization group, with no difference in overall quality-adjusted life-years. Subset analysis demonstrated that PHSI for patients with isolated head or neck injuries provided equivocal benefit over nonimmobilization. CONCLUSION: PHSI was not cost-effective for patients with torso or extremity penetrating trauma. Despite increased incidence of unstable spine injures produced by penetrating head or neck injuries, the cost-benefit of PHSI in these patients is equivocal, and further studies may be needed before omitting PHSI in patients with penetrating head and neck injuries.

13679,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of endovascular versus open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in the Amsterdam Acute Aneurysm Trial,"BACKGROUND: Minimally invasive endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) could be a surgical technique that improves outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA). The aim of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of EVAR compared with standard open repair (OR) in the treatment of rAAA, with costs per 30-day and 6-month survivor as outcome parameters. METHODS: Resource use was determined from the Amsterdam Acute Aneurysm (AJAX) trial, a multicentre randomized trial comparing EVAR with OR in patients with rAAA. The analysis was performed from a provider perspective. All costs were calculated as if all patients had been treated in the same hospital (Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis, teaching hospital). RESULTS: A total of 116 patients were randomized. The 30-day mortality rate was 21 per cent after EVAR and 25 per cent for OR: absolute risk reduction (ARR) 4.4 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) -11.0 to 19.7) per cent. At 6 months, the total mortality rate for EVAR was 28 per cent, compared with 31 per cent among those assigned to OR: ARR 2.4 (-14.2 to 19.0) per cent. The mean cost difference between EVAR and OR was euro5306 (95 per cent c.i. -1854 to 12,659) at 30 days and euro10,189 (-2477 to 24,506) at 6 months. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per prevented death was euro120,591 at 30 days and euro424,542 at 6 months. There was no significant difference in quality of life between EVAR and OR. Nor was EVAR superior regarding cost-utility. CONCLUSION: EVAR may be more effective for rAAA, but its increased costs mean that it is unaffordable based on current standards of societal willingness-to-pay for health gains.",2014-01-17055,24469619,J Clin Psychopharmacol,M R Kapma,2014,101 / 3,208-15,No,24469619,"M R Kapma; L M Dijksman; J J Reimerink; A J de Groof; C J Zeebregts; W Wisselink; R Balm; M G W Dijkgraaf; A C Vahl; Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of endovascular versus open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in the Amsterdam Acute Aneurysm Trial, J Clin Psychopharmacol, ; 101(3):0271-0749; 208-15",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular aneurysm repair vs. Open repair,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,391885,Euro,2010,615568.82
13680,"Cost effectiveness of a 21-gene recurrence score assay versus Canadian clinical practice in post-menopausal women with early-stage estrogen or progesterone-receptor-positive, axillary lymph-node positive breast cancer","BACKGROUND: A 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay provides a method of guiding treatment decisions in women with early-stage breast cancer (ESBC). We investigated the cost effectiveness of using the RS assay versus current clinical practice (CCP) in post-menopausal women with estrogen- or progesterone-receptor-positive, one to three positive axillary lymph-node ESBC from the perspective of the Canadian public healthcare system. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to project the lifetime clinical and economic consequences of ESBC. We assumed that the RS assay would classify patients among risk levels (low, intermediate and high) and corresponding adjuvant treatment regimens. The model was parameterized using 7-year follow-up data from the Manitoba Cancer Registry, cost data from Manitoba Health administrative databases and secondary sources. Costs are presented in 2012 Canadian dollars, and future costs and benefits were discounted at 5 %. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the RS assay compared with CCP led to an increase of 0.08 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) and an increase in cost of Can$36.2 per person, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Can$464/QALY gained. The ICER was most sensitive to the proportion of women classified to intermediate risk by the RS assay who received adjuvant chemotherapy, and absolute risk of relapse among patients receiving the RS assay. CONCLUSIONS: The RS assay is likely to be cost effective in the Canadian healthcare system. Field evaluations of the assay in this patient population will help reduce uncertainty in clinical guidelines for intermediate-range RS-assay values and specific disease outcomes by the RS assay, which are important drivers of ICER.",2014-01-17061,24288208,Pharmacoeconomics,Malek B Hannouf,2014,32 / 2,135-47,Yes,24288208,"Malek B Hannouf; Bin Xie; Muriel Brackstone; Gregory S Zaric; Cost effectiveness of a 21-gene recurrence score assay versus Canadian clinical practice in post-menopausal women with early-stage estrogen or progesterone-receptor-positive, axillary lymph-node positive breast cancer, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 32(2):1179-2027; 135-47",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Recurrence score, 21-gene assay vs. Standard/Usual Care","Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, on to three positive axillary lymph nodes breast cancer",Not Stated,50 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,464,Canada,2012,523.17

DESIGN: Model-based economic evaluation using individual-level data from a Birmingham-based longitudinal patient database and from published sources. Both a decision tree and state-transition (Markov) model were developed, from an National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Sensitivity analyses were also carried out. SETTING: Secondary care treatment for patients with small-to-medium-sized vestibular schwannomas. PARTICIPANTS: Three hypothetical cohorts of adult patients receiving conservative management, radiosurgery or surgery treatment, aged 58 years as starting age within model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness based on cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Conservative management is the preferred strategy for the treatment of small-to-medium-sized vestibular schwannomas. Conservative management is both cheaper (- pound 722 and - pound 2764) and more effective (0.136 and 0.554 quality-adjusted life years) than both radiosurgery and surgery, respectively.

13683,The cost effectiveness of dry powder antibiotics for the treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis,"BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects over 9,000 people in the UK and limits life expectancy. CF patients are susceptible to lung infections, most commonly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Once infection is established, patients require lifetime treatment using nebulised antibiotics. Newer dry powder formulations of antibiotics may reduce treatment burden and improve compliance. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of (i) colistimethate sodium dry powder for inhalation (DPI) and (ii) tobramycin DPI versus nebulised tobramycin for the treatment of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection in patients with CF from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal Social Services (PSS). METHODS: We developed a state transition model based on transitions between three strata of lung function measured in terms of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) % predicted. Additional health states representing post-lung transplantation and dead are also modelled. The model structure was informed by systematic reviews of evidence concerning the plausibility of potential relationships between intermediate endpoints and final outcomes. The model assumes that treatment impacts on FEV1 trajectory, which manifest as changes in health-related quality of life. No survival benefit is assumed due to the absence of robust quantifiable evidence. Model parameters were informed by patient-level and aggregate data from two randomised controlled trials together with the best available evidence from the literature. Resource use and costs associated with drug acquisition, the management of exacerbations and reduced nebuliser maintenance were drawn from reference sources and expert opinion. Costs were valued at 2011/2012 prices. Costs and health outcomes were discounted at a rate of 3.5 %. Simple and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken, including additional analyses of Patient Access Scheme (PAS) price discounts offered by the manufacturers of both DPI products. RESULTS: Colistimethate sodium DPI is expected to produce fewer quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than nebulised tobramycin. Based on its list price, colistimethate sodium DPI is expected to be dominated by nebulised tobramycin. When the PAS is incorporated, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for colistimethate sodium DPI versus nebulised tobramycin is expected to be approximately pound288,600 saved per QALY lost. Based on its current list price, the ICER for tobramycin DPI versus nebulised tobramycin is expected to be approximately pound124,000 per QALY gained.

CONCLUSIONS: Under their list prices, neither DPI product is likely to represent good value for money for the NHS given current cost-effectiveness thresholds.

13685,Economic analysis of revision amputation and replantation treatment of finger amputation injuries,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis to compare revision amputation and replantation treatment of finger amputation injuries across a spectrum of injury scenarios. METHODS: The study was conducted from the societal perspective. Decision tree models were created for the reference case (two-finger amputation injury) and seven additional injury scenarios for comparison. Inputs included cost, quality of life, and probability of each health state. A Web-based time trade-off survey was created to determine quality-adjusted life-years for health states; 685 nationally representative adult community members were invited to participate in the survey. Overall cost and quality-adjusted life-years for revision amputation and replantation were calculated for each decision tree. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated if a treatment was more costly but more effective. RESULTS: The authors had a 64 percent response rate (n = 437). Replantation treatment had greater costs and quality-adjusted life-years compared with revision amputation in all injury scenarios. Replantation of single-digit injuries had the highest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ($136,400 per quality-adjusted life-year gained). Replantation of three- and four-digit amputation injuries had relatively low cost-to-benefit ratios ($27,100 and $23,800 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively). Replantation for distal thumb amputation had a relatively low incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ($26,300 per quality-adjusted life-year) compared with replantation of nonthumb distal amputations ($60,200 per quality-adjusted life-year). CONCLUSIONS: The relative cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained with replantation treatment varied greatly among the injury scenarios.

13686,Cost-effectiveness of Barostim therapy for the treatment of resistant hypertension in European settings,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to simulate the cost-effectiveness and the long-term clinical performance of the Barostim neo System for the treatment of resistant hypertension when compared to optimal medical treatment. METHODS: A decision analytic model with a combination of a decision tree and Markov process was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Barostim. The clinical effectiveness of Barostim was based on the results of the randomized, placebo-controlled Rheos trial and the follow-up substudy of the DEBuT-HT trial. The cost-effectiveness was modelled from a German societal perspective over a lifetime horizon. Patients with high SBP levels have an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure and end-stage renal disease. RESULTS: In a simulated cohort of 50-year-old patients at high risk of end-organ damage, Barostim therapy generated 1.66 additional life-years and 2.17 additional quality-adjusted life years with an incremental cost of &OV0556;16 891 when compared with continuation of medical management. Barostim was estimated to be cost-effective compared with optimal medical treatment with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of &OV0556;7 797/QALY. In the model, Barostim reduced over a lifetime the rates of myocardial infarction by 19%, stroke by 35%, heart failure by 12% and end-stage renal disease by 23%. The cost-effectiveness of Barostim can be greater in younger patients with resistant hypertension and in patients with significant risk factors for end-organ damage.

13687,Cost-effectiveness of rituximab as maintenance treatment for relapsed follicular lymphoma: results of a population-based study,"OBJECTIVES: On the basis of two population-based registries, our study aims to calculate the real-world cost-effectiveness of rituximab maintenance compared with observation in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma patients who responded to second-line chemotherapy. METHODS: Data were obtained from the EORTC20981 trial, the Netherlands Cancer Registry and two population-based registries. A Markov model was developed to calculate cost per life year gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for three scenarios. RESULTS: Our real-world patients were (62 years) 6 to 7 years older and had higher complete response rates to second-line chemotherapy than the trial population. Differences between the real-world rituximab and observation group were observed for second-line chemotherapy and disease progression. Groups were more balanced after using propensity matching. Relying entirely on updated trial results (scenario1) in combination with local cost data resulted in ratios of euro11,259 per LYG and euro12,655 per QALY. For scenario2, consisting of trial efficacy and matched real-world costs, ratios of euro21,202 per LYG and euro23,821 per QALY were calculated. Using real-world matched evidence (scenario3) for both effectiveness and costs showed ratios of euro10,591 per LYG and euro11,245 per QALY.

13688,Cost-effectiveness of rituximab as maintenance treatment for relapsed follicular lymphoma: results of a population-based study,"OBJECTIVES: On the basis of two population-based registries, our study aims to calculate the real-world cost-effectiveness of rituximab maintenance compared with observation in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma patients who responded to second-line chemotherapy. METHODS: Data were obtained from the EORTC20981 trial, the Netherlands Cancer Registry and two population-based registries. A Markov model was developed to calculate cost per life year gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for three scenarios. RESULTS: Our real-world patients were (62 years) 6 to 7 years older and had higher complete response rates to second-line chemotherapy than the trial population. Differences between the real-world rituximab and observation group were observed for second-line chemotherapy and disease progression. Groups were more balanced after using propensity matching. Relying entirely on updated trial results (scenario1) in combination with local cost data resulted in ratios of euro11,259 per LYG and euro12,655 per QALY. For scenario2, consisting of trial efficacy and matched real-world costs, ratios of euro21,202 per LYG and euro23,821 per QALY were calculated.

13690,Modelling the cost effectiveness of rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in first-line therapy and following relapse,"BACKGROUND: The efficacy and safety of adding rituximab to fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC) for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) has been demonstrated in two randomised trials: CLL-8 was conducted in previously untreated patients, and REACH was conducted in previously treated patients. In both trials, progression-free survival was increased in the R-FC treatment groups compared with the FC treatment groups. In CLL-8, overall survival was also significantly increased. OBJECTIVE: To develop an economic model to assess the cost effectiveness, from the Australian healthcare perspective, of rituximab when used as a treatment for both previously untreated and relapsed/refractory CLL. METHODS: A Markov model with three health states (unprogressed, progressed and death) was developed to extrapolate the trial results over a 15-year time horizon. A treatment algorithm was developed with Australian haematologists to inform the treatments to be modelled. The base-case compares up to three courses of six cycles of R-FC (''first-line'' treatment) followed by three courses of post-progression salvage (''Salvage'') treatment (including rituximab) with three courses of FC followed by three courses of Salvage treatment (excluding rituximab). Subsequent treatments are incorporated into the model by repeating the unprogressed and progressed health states for each treatment. Time-dependent transition probabilities for the model were estimated from an analysis of individual patient data from CLL-8 and REACH. Comparisons of the hazard rates for the CLL-8 and REACH trials enabled an assessment of the impact on the transitions of receiving the same regimen as the first or second treatment, and hence inform assumptions regarding transitions for third and subsequent treatments. Costs applied in the model were based on published Australian prices in 2009. RESULTS: The model predicts patients receive an average of approximately two courses of treatment, and the addition of rituximab results in an incremental gain of 0.94 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost associated with the addition of rituximab is A$40,268, and hence the cost per QALY gained (QALYG) is A$42,906. CONCLUSION: Rituximab, in combination with chemotherapy, when used multiple times throughout the treatment algorithm, appears to be cost effective for CLL from the Australian healthcare perspective, with a cost/QALYG within the range generally accepted as providing value.",2014-01-17094,24442832,Pharmacoeconomics,Michael Adena,2014,32 / 2,193-207,Yes,24442832,"Michael Adena; Jennifer Houltram; Stephen P Mulligan; Carlene Todd; Grace Malanos; Modelling the cost effectiveness of rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in first-line therapy and following relapse, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 32(2):1179-2027; 193-207",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Rituximab, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide treatment followed by rituximab-Salvage vs. Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide treatment followed by Salvage",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,5.00,5.00,42906,Australia,2009,41028.73
13691,"Is prostate cancer screening cost-effective? A microsimulation model of prostate-specific antigen-based screening for British Columbia, Canada","Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening for prostate cancer may reduce mortality, but it incurs considerable risk of over diagnosis and potential harm to quality of life. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PSA screening, with and without adjustment for quality of life, for the British Columbia (BC) population. We adapted an existing natural history model using BC incidence, treatment, cost and mortality patterns. The modeled mortality benefit of screening derives from a stage-shift mechanism, assuming mortality reduction consistent with the European Study of Randomized Screening for Prostate Cancer. The model projected outcomes for 40-year-old men under 14 combinations of screening ages and frequencies. Cost and utility estimates were explored with deterministic sensitivity analysis. The incremental cost-effectiveness of regular screening ranged from $36,300/LYG, for screening every four years from ages 55 to 69 years, to $588,300/LYG, for screening every two years from ages 40 to 74 years. The marginal benefits of increasing screening frequency to 2 years or starting screening at age 40 years were small and came at significant cost. After utility adjustment, all screening strategies resulted in a loss of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); however, this result was very sensitive to utility estimates. Plausible outcomes under a range of screening strategies inform discussion of prostate cancer screening policy in BC and similar jurisdictions. Screening may be cost-effective, but the sensitivity of results to utility values suggests individual preferences for quality versus quantity of life should be a key consideration.",2014-01-17095,24443367,Int J Cancer,Reka Pataky,2014,135 / 4,939-47,No,24443367,"Reka Pataky; Roman Gulati; Ruth Etzioni; Peter Black; Kim N Chi; Andrew J Coldman; Tom Pickles; Scott Tyldesley; Stuart Peacock; Is prostate cancer screening cost-effective?

13692,The potential economic benefits of improved postfracture care: a cost-effectiveness analysis of a fracture liaison service in the US health-care system,"Fractures related to osteoporosis are associated with $20 billion in cost in the United States, with the majority of cost born by federal health-care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Despite the proven fracture reduction benefits of several osteoporosis treatments, less than one-quarter of patients older than 65 years of age who fracture receive such care. A postfracture liaison service (FLS) has been developed in many health systems but has not been widely implemented in the United States. We developed a Markov state-transition computer simulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of an FLS using a health-care system perspective. Using the model, we projected the lifetime costs and benefits of FLS, with or without a bone mineral density test, in men and women who had experienced a hip fracture. We estimated the costs and benefits of an FLS, the probabilities of refracture while on osteoporosis treatment, as well as the utilities associated with various health states from published literature. We used multi-way sensitivity analyses to examine impact of uncertainty in input parameters on cost-effectiveness of FLS. The model estimates that an FLS would result in 153 fewer fractures (109 hip, 5 wrist, 21 spine, 17 other), 37.43 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and save $66,879 compared with typical postfracture care per every 10,000 postfracture patients. Doubling the cost of the FLS resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $22,993 per QALY. The sensitivity analyses showed that results were robust to plausible ranges of input parameters; assuming the least favorable values of each of the major input parameters results in an ICER of $112,877 per QALY. An FLS targeting patients post-hip fracture should result in cost savings and reduced fractures under most scenarios.",2014-01-17096,24443384,J Bone Miner Res,Daniel H Solomon,2014,29 / 7,1667-74,No,24443384,"Daniel H Solomon; Amanda R Patrick; John Schousboe; Elena Losina; The potential economic benefits of improved postfracture care: a cost-effectiveness analysis of a fracture liaison service in the US health-care system, J Bone Miner Res, ; 29(7):1523-4681; 1667-74",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fracture liaison service vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-1750,United States,2010,-2077.08

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant, recently published studies and the new trial data were synthesised, via a Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA), to estimate the relative efficacy of the TNF-alpha inhibitors in terms of Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) response, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores and Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). A previously developed economic model was updated with the new meta-analysis results and current cost data. The model was adapted to delineate patients by PASI 50%, 75% and 90% response rates to differentiate between psoriasis outcomes. RESULTS: All four licensed TNF-alpha inhibitors were significantly more effective than placebo in achieving PsARC response in patients with active PsA.

METHODS: Economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic, multi-worksite, randomized controlled trial comparing enhanced usual care (EUC; usual care plus biometric screening) to the addition of a naturopathic approach to CVD prevention (NC+EUC). RESULTS: After 1 year, NC+EUC resulted in a net decrease of 3.3 (confidence interval: 1.7 to 4.8) percentage points in 10-year CVD event risk (number needed to treat = 30). These risk reductions came with average net study-year savings of $1138 in societal costs and $1187 in employer costs. There was no change in quality-adjusted life years across the study year. CONCLUSIONS: A naturopathic approach to CVD primary prevention significantly reduced CVD risk over usual care plus biometric screening and reduced costs to society and employers in this multi-worksite-based study.

13698,Costs and utilities of manual therapy and orthopedic standard care for low-prioritized orthopedic outpatients of working age: a cost consequence analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Treatment for musculoskeletal disorders in primary care in Sweden is generally initiated with advice and medication. Second-line therapy is physiotherapy and/or injection and radiography; third-line therapy is referral to an orthopedist. Manual therapy is not routine. It is a challenge to identify patients who benefit from treatment by different specialists. The current referral strategy probably contributes to long waiting lists in orthopedic departments, which is costly and implies prolonged suffering for the patients. The aim of this health economic evaluation was to compare costs and outcomes from naprapathic manual therapy (NMT) with orthopedic standard care for common, low-prioritized, nonsurgical musculoskeletal disorders, after second-line treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diagnose Related Groups were used to define the costs, and the SF-36 was encoded to evaluate the outcomes in cost per quality adjusted life years gained. RESULTS: Results from a 12 months'' follow-up showed significantly larger improvement for the NMT than for orthopedic standard care, significantly lower mean cost per patient; 5427 SEK (*Price level 2009; 1 Euro=106,213 SEK; 1 US Dollar=76,457 SEK) (95% confidence interval, 3693-7161) compared to14298 SEK (95% confidence interval, 8322-20,274), and more gains in outcomes in cost per quality adjusted life years per patient (0.066 compared with 0.026). Thus the result is ""dominant.""

13699,Cost-effectiveness of different strategies for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in a health resource-limited setting,"PURPOSE: To compare the lifetime cost and effectiveness of five alternative chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) management strategies: rivaroxaban, warfarin, aspirin plus clopidogrel, aspirin and no prevention. METHODS: An individual-level state-transition model was developed to track the lifetime disease course associated with AF. The clinical and utility data were derived from published studies. The cost data were estimated based on local charges and current Chinese practices. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of uncertainty on the results. RESULTS: For base-case patients with a CHADS2 score of 3, the cost per additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained for rivaroxaban compared with no prevention, aspirin, aspirin plus clopidogrel and warfarin was $116,884, $153,944, $155,979 and $216,273, respectively. CHADS2 score had a substantial impact on the model outcomes for different prevention strategies. The time distribution of warfarin international normalised ratio (INR), stroke and intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) risks, cost of rivaroxaban and utility of warfarin therapy had substantial impacts on the results. Based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $16,350/QALY, no prevention strategy was the preferred therapy for a patient with a low risk for stroke and a high risk for ICH; aspirin was preferred for patients with a moderate risk for stroke and ICH; and warfarin was preferred for patients with a high risk for stroke and a low risk of ICH. CONCLUSION: In the context of limited health resources, rivaroxaban is unlikely to be cost-effective, although it provided more health benefits comparing with other strategies.

13700,Cost-effectiveness of different strategies for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation in a health resource-limited setting,"PURPOSE: To compare the lifetime cost and effectiveness of five alternative chronic atrial fibrillation (AF) management strategies: rivaroxaban, warfarin, aspirin plus clopidogrel, aspirin and no prevention. METHODS: An individual-level state-transition model was developed to track the lifetime disease course associated with AF. The clinical and utility data were derived from published studies. The cost data were estimated based on local charges and current Chinese practices. Sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of uncertainty on the results. RESULTS: For base-case patients with a CHADS2 score of 3, the cost per additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained for rivaroxaban compared with no prevention, aspirin, aspirin plus clopidogrel and warfarin was $116,884, $153,944, $155,979 and $216,273, respectively. CHADS2 score had a substantial impact on the model outcomes for different prevention strategies. The time distribution of warfarin international normalised ratio (INR), stroke and intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) risks, cost of rivaroxaban and utility of warfarin therapy had substantial impacts on the results. Based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $16,350/QALY, no prevention strategy was the preferred therapy for a patient with a low risk for stroke and a high risk for ICH; aspirin was preferred for patients with a moderate risk for stroke and ICH; and warfarin was preferred for patients with a high risk for stroke and a low risk of ICH.
