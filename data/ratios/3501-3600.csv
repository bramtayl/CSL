3501,Cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction--an analysis of the EPHESUS study from a Swiss perspective,"OBJECTIVE: The EPHESUS study demonstrated that aldosterone blockade with eplerenone decreased mortality in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and heart failure after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The EPHESUS pharmacoeconomic analysis was performed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in the Swiss setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 6,632 patients with LVSD and heart failure after AMI were randomized to eplerenone or placebo and followed for a mean of 16 months. The co-primary endpoints were all-cause death and the composite of cardiovascular death/cardiovascular hospitalization. The evaluation of resource use included hospitalizations, outpatient services, and medications. Survival beyond the trial period was estimated using data from the Framingham Heart Study, the Saskatchewan Health database, and the Worcester Heart Attack Registry. The incremental cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in cost per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year gained was estimated. The perspective of the Swiss third party payers was used. Daily treatment costs of eplerenone were set at CHF 3.88. All other resources were valued on the basis of official tariffs. Discounting of the results was performed at a rate of 3%. RESULTS: The number of life-years gained with eplerenone was 0.1083 based on Framingham, 0.0661 with Saskatchewan and 0.1518 with Worcester survival estimates. Total costs were CHF 1,028 higher over the trial period in the eplerenone arm, due to drug cost. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was CHF 10,145 per life-year gained with Framingham, CHF 16,178 with Saskatchewan, and CHF 7,693 with Worcester survival estimates. The corresponding costs per QALY were CHF 15,219, CHF 23,965 and CHF 11,337, respectively. CONCLUSION: Eplerenone is effective in reducing mortality and, in Switzerland, is also cost-effective in increasing years of life for patients with LVSD after AMI.",2006-01-02595,16775667,Cardiovasc Drugs Ther,Thomas D Szucs,2006,20 / 3,193-204,No,16775667,"Thomas D Szucs; Majbrit V Holm; Matthias Schwenkglenks; Zefeng Zhang; William S Weintraub; Michel Burnier; Paul Erne; Cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction--an analysis of the EPHESUS study from a Swiss perspective, Cardiovasc Drugs Ther, 2006-Jun; 20(3):0920-3206; 193-204",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eplerenone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,Not Stated,15219,Switzerland,2005,16214.08
3502,A mediterranean diet is cost-effective in patients with previous myocardial infarction,"This evaluation aimed to assess the economic performance of the Mediterranean diet for patients after a first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A cost utility analysis using a Markov model was used to compare the Mediterranean diet to a prudent Western diet over a time frame of 10 years. After a systematic review of the literature, program effectiveness was based on the Lyon Diet Heart Study (605 patients, mean age 54 y, randomized to the Mediterranean diet delivered by a dietician and cardiologist, or a prudent Western diet). Costs were estimated in AU$ [and converted to US$ and Euros (euro)] based on the resource use to which published unit costs were applied. Cost and benefits were discounted at 5% per annum. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Extensive 1-way sensitivity analyses were performed. The Mediterranean diet compared with a prudent Western diet was estimated to cost AU$1013 (US$703, euro579) per QALY gained per person. There was a mean gain in life years of 0.31/person and a gain in quality-adjusted life years of 0.40/person. Based on the published results from the Lyon Diet Heart Study and conservative assumptions, the Mediterranean diet is highly cost-effective for persons after a first AMI and represents an exceptional return on investment. Policy makers should strongly consider the generalizability of results to their own setting.",2006-01-02598,16772453,J Nutr,Kim Dalziel,2006,136 / 7,1879-85,No,16772453,"Kim Dalziel; Leonie Segal; Michel de Lorgeril; A mediterranean diet is cost-effective in patients with previous myocardial infarction, J Nutr, 2006-Jul; 136(7):0022-3166; 1879-85",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dietary advice on how to modify diet to Mediterranean Diet (as used in Lyon Diet Heart Study).,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,1013,Australia,2003,929.54
3503,The cost-effectiveness of therapy with teriparatide and alendronate in women with severe osteoporosis,"BACKGROUND: Teriparatide is a promising new agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. METHODS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of teriparatide-based strategies compared with alendronate sodium for the first-line treatment of high-risk osteoporotic women. We developed a microsimulation with a societal perspective. Key data sources include the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, the Fracture Intervention Trial, and the Fracture Prevention Trial. We evaluated postmenopausal white women with low bone density and prevalent vertebral fracture. The interventions were usual care (UC) (calcium or vitamin D supplementation) compared with 3 strategies: 5 years of alendronate therapy, 2 years of teriparatide therapy, and 2 years of teriparatide therapy followed by 5 years of alendronate therapy (sequential teriparatide/alendronate). The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: For the base-case analysis, the cost of alendronate treatment was 11,600 dollars per QALY compared with UC. The cost of sequential teriparatide/alendronate therapy was 156,500 dollars per QALY compared with alendronate. Teriparatide treatment alone was more expensive and produced a smaller increase in QALYs than alendronate. For sensitivity analysis, teriparatide alone was less cost-effective than alendronate even if its efficacy lasted 15 years after treatment cessation. Sequential teriparatide/alendronate therapy was less cost-effective than alendronate even if fractures were eliminated during the alendronate phase, although its cost-effectiveness was less than 50,000 dollars per QALY if the price of teriparatide decreased 60%, if used in elderly women with T scores of -4.0 or less, or if 6 months of teriparatide therapy had comparable efficacy to 2 years of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Alendronate compares favorably to interventions accepted as cost-effective. Therapy with teriparatide alone is more expensive and produces a smaller increase in QALYs than therapy with alendronate.

3507,Management of ocular hypertension: a cost-effectiveness approach from the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study,"PURPOSE: The Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) demonstrated that medical treatment of people with intraocular pressure (IOP) of > or =24 mm Hg reduces the risk of the development of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) by 60%. There is no consensus on which people with ocular hypertension would benefit from treatment. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis with the use of a Markov model. METHODS: We modeled a hypothetic cohort of people with IOP of > or =24 mm Hg. Four treatment thresholds were considered: (1) Treat no one; (2) treat people with a > or =5% annual risk of the development of POAG; (3) treat people with a > or =2% annual risk of the development of POAG, and (4) treat everyone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was evaluated. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for treatment of people with ocular hypertension were 3670 US dollars per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) for the Treat > or =5% threshold and 42,430 US dollars/QALY for the Treat > or =2% threshold. ""Treat everyone"" cost more and was less effective than other options. Assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of 50,000 to 100,000 US dollars/QALY, the Treat > or =2% threshold would result in the most net health benefit. The decision was sensitive to the incidence of POAG without treatment, treatment effectiveness, and the utility loss because of POAG. CONCLUSION: Although the treatment of individual patients is largely dependent on their attitude toward the risk of disease progression and blindness, the treatment of those patients with IOP of > or =24 mm Hg and a > or =2% annual risk of the development of glaucoma is likely to be cost-effective.

The cost-effectiveness of treating these patients with peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin has yet to be explored from a US societal perspective. OBJECTIVE: To predict the cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin with interferon/ribavirin (IFN/RBV) or no treatment in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. STUDY DESIGN: A Markov model was constructed with liver progression estimates based on published literature. Sustained virological response and baseline characteristics of the reference case were based on APRICOT. Quality of life and costs in 2004 US dollars (US$) were based on literature estimates and discounted at 3%. RESULTS: Peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin compared with IFN/RBV or no treatment is predicted to increase quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.73 and 0.94 years, respectively, in HCV-genotype-1 patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of peginterferon alfa-2a/ribavirin compared with IFN/RBV and no treatment for all patients is respectively US$ 2,082 and 5,187/QALY gained.

3516,Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Population endoscopic screening for gastric cancer is generally deemed not to be cost-effective except in Japan, where its prevalence is very high. However, in the absence of screening, patients present with advanced disease, and prognosis is poor. We conducted a cost utility analysis to determine whether endoscopic screening for stomach cancer in intermediate-risk population would be cost-effective and to better define the high-risk groups in the population who would benefit from such strategy. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by using a Markov Model. Simulation was performed on Singapore (intermediate-risk) population and various high-risk subgroups. Comparison was made between 2-yearly endoscopic mass screening program versus no screening. Data sources were extracted from relevant studies published from 1980-2004 identified via systematic PUBMED search. Main outcome measures were deaths caused by stomach cancer averted, cost per life saved, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved. RESULTS: Screening of high-risk group of Chinese men (age-standardized rate, 25.9/100,000) from 50-70 years old is highly cost-effective, with cost benefit of United States $26,836 per QALY. Screening this cohort of 199,000 subjects prevents 743 stomach cancer deaths and saves 8234 absolute life years. Cost of averting 1 cancer death is United States $247,600. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to incidence of stomach cancer and cost of screening endoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Screening of stomach cancer in moderate to high-risk population subgroups is cost-effective. Targeted screening strategies for stomach cancer should be explored.",2006-01-02606,16765306,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,Yock Young Dan,2006,4 / 6,709-16,No,16765306,"Yock Young Dan; J B Y So; Khay Guan Yeoh; Endoscopic screening for gastric cancer, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2006-Jun; 4(6):1542-3565; 709-16",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endoscopic screening for stomach cancer,Not Stated,70 Years,50 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,26836,United States,2003,37747.02

The research design consisted of a before and after-treatment study without comparison groups. We collected data from May 1999 through July 2001 at 473 institutions located throughout Japan. The subjects were ASO patients who experienced pain at rest or had ulcers of the extremities. METHODS: The observation period was a 2-month period that commenced with the start of administration of LipoPGE1. The HRQOL score (utility value) was obtained from the EQ-5D instrument, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated on the basis of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The mean utility value for the 2 months after the start of the administration of LipoPGE(1) was 0.672, and it was a significantly higher (P<0.0001) than the 0.616 before administration of LipoPGE(1). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 18,807 US dollar/QALY assuming that drug efficacy persisted for 1 year after the end of LipoPGE1 therapy, and 75,227 dollar/QALY assuming a duration of just 3 months. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that when LipoPGE1 is added to the conventional treatment of ASO patients, the HRQOL of the patient improves, and it is highly cost-effective.",2006-01-02608,16763534,Int Angiol,S Ikeda,2006,25 / 2,169-74,No,16763534,"S Ikeda; M Kobayashi; S Fukuhara; K Esato; Cost-effectiveness of Liple (LipoPGE1) for arteriosclerosis obliterans patients in Japan: an economic evaluation using the EQ-5D instrument, Int Angiol, 2006-Jun; 25(2):0392-9590; 169-74",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Liple (LipoPGE1),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,0 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,18807,Japan,2003,228.52
3518,Dalteparin versus warfarin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolic events in cancer patients: a pharmacoeconomic analysis,"OBJECTIVE: In a recent randomised trial (CLOT [Comparison of Low molecular weight heparin versus Oral anticoagulant Therapy for long term anticoagulation in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism]), which evaluated secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in cancer patients, dalteparin reduced the relative risk of recurrent VTEs by 52% compared with oral anticoagulation therapy (p = 0.002). A Canadian pharmacoeconomic analysis was conducted to measure the economic value of dalteparin for this indication. DESIGN: The study was conducted from the Canadian healthcare system. The first part of this study utilised the CLOT trial database, from which resource utilisation data were converted into Canadian cost estimates (Can dollars, year 2005 values). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were conducted to compare the total cost of therapy between patients randomised to treatment with dalteparin or oral therapy. Health state utilities and treatment preferences were then measured in 24 oncology care providers using the time trade-off technique. RESULTS: When all of the cost components were combined for the entire population (n = 676), patients in the dalteparin group had significantly higher overall costs than the control group (Can dollars 4162 vs Can dollars 2003; p < 0.001). The preference assessment revealed that 23 of 24 respondents (96%) selected dalteparin over warfarin, with an associated gain of 0.157 QALYs. When the incremental cost of dalteparin (Can dollars 2159 per patient) was combined with the QALY gain, the findings revealed that dalteparin was associated with a cost of approximately Can dollars 13,800 (95% CI 12,400, 15,100) per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Given the practical advantages of dalteparin in terms of convenience, improved efficacy and the acceptable economic value, this analysis suggests that long-term dalteparin therapy is a sound alternative to warfarin for the prevention of recurrent VTEs in patients with cancer.",2006-01-02611,16761906,Pharmacoeconomics,George Dranitsaris,2006,24 / 6,593-607,Yes,16761906,"George Dranitsaris; Mark Vincent; Mark Crowther; Dalteparin versus warfarin for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolic events in cancer patients: a pharmacoeconomic analysis, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(6):1179-2027; 593-607",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dalteparin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,13800,Canada,2005,15104.78

3523,Retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis of screening mammography,"BACKGROUND: Many guidelines recommend screening mammography every 1-2 years for women older than 40 years; more than 70% of women now participate in routine screening. No studies have examined the societal impact of screening practices over the past decade in the United States on costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We performed a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis comparing actual and alternative screening mammography scenarios. METHODS: We used a discrete-event simulation model of breast cancer epidemiology to estimate the costs and the number of QALYs that were associated with observed screening mammography patterns in the United States from 1990 to 2000 for women aged 40 years or older. We also estimated costs and QALYS for no screening and for 64 alternative screening scenarios. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were computed. Sensitivity analyses were performed on key parameters. RESULTS: Actual U.S. screening patterns from 1990 to 2000 accrued 947.5 million QALYs and cost $166 billion over the lifetimes of the screened women, resulting in a gain of 1.7 million QALYs for an additional cost of $62.5 billion compared with no screening. Among those polices that were not dominated--i.e., for which no alternative existed that produced more QALYs for lower costs--screening all women aged 40-80 years annually per some U.S. guidelines was the most expensive option, costing $58,000 per additional QALY gained compared with the next most costly alternative, screening all women aged 45-80 years annually.

Health care cost associated with AC alone vs. AC with paclitaxel was compared under Thai health care context. Based on CALGB9344, paclitaxel increased the disease-free survival (DFS) by 17%. Based on Markov simulation for 15 years, paclitaxel prolonged the patient's life by 0.30 quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Such an increased effectiveness was offset by the adjuvant cost net of recurrence, follow-up, and terminal care by 221,433 Baht. This means an additional year of perfect health gained by paclitaxel is achieved through an incremental cost of 738,111 Baht. Such an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is beyond the threshold recommended by World Health Organization.

Investigators used the validated Center for Outcomes Research (CORE) Diabetes Model to project clinical and cost outcomes over a 35-year base case time horizon; outcome data were extracted directly from randomized, controlled trials designed to compare detemir with NPH and with insulin glargine. Modeled patient characteristics were derived from corresponding trials, and simulations incorporated published quality-of-life utilities with cost data obtained from a Medicare perspective. Detemir, when compared with NPH, increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.698 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Lifetime direct medical costs were increased by 10,451 dollars per patient, although indirect costs were reduced by 4688 dollars. On the basis of direct costs, the cost per QALY gained with detemir was 14,974 dollars. In comparison with glargine, detemir increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.063 QALYs, reduced direct medical costs by 2072 dollars per patient, and decreased indirect costs by 3103 dollars (dominant). Reductions in diabetes-related comorbidities were also associated with detemir in both instances, most notably in the complications of retinopathy and nephropathy. Relative reductions in rates of complications were greatest in the comparison of detemir with NPH. Results were most sensitive to variation in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels.

3535,Cost-effectiveness of chronic hepatitis C treatment with thymosin alpha-1,"BACKGROUND: More than one million individuals in Mexico are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 80% are at risk for developing a chronic infection that could lead to hepatic cirrhosis and other complications that impact quality of life and institutional costs. The objective of the study was to determine the most cost-effective treatment against HCV among the following: peginterferon, peginterferon plus ribavirin, peginterferon plus ribavirin plus thymosin, and no treatment. METHODS: We carried out cost-effectiveness analysis using the institutional perspective, including a 45-year time frame and a 3% discount rate for costs and effectiveness. We employed a Bayesian-focused decision tree and a Markov model. One- and two-way sensitivity analyses were performed, as well as threshold-oriented and probabilistic analyses, and we obtained acceptability curves and net health benefits. RESULTS: Triple therapy (peginterferon plus ribavirin plus thymosin alpha-1) was dominant with lower cost and higher utility in relationship with peginterferon + ribavirin option, peginterferon alone and no-treatment option. In triple therapy the cost per unit of success was of 1,908 [USD/quality-adjusted life years (QALY)] compared with peginterferon plus ribavirin 2,277/QALY, peginterferon alone 2,929/QALY, and no treatment 4,204/QALY.

3538,Primary therapist model for patients referred for rheumatoid arthritis rehabilitation: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness (ICE) of services from a primary therapist compared with traditional physical therapists and/or occupational therapists for managing rheumatoid arthritis (RA), from the societal perspective. METHODS: Patients with RA were randomly assigned to the primary therapist model (PTM) or traditional treatment model (TTM) for approximately 6 weeks of rehabilitation treatment. Health outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), measured with the EuroQol instrument at baseline, 6 weeks, and 6 months. Direct and indirect costs, including visits to health professionals, use of investigative tests, hospital visits, use of medications, purchases of adaptive aids, and productivity losses incurred by patients and their caregivers, were collected monthly. RESULTS: Of 144 consenting patients, 111 remained in the study after the baseline assessment: 63 PTM (87.3% women, mean age 54.2 years, disease duration 10.6 years) and 48 TTM (79.2% women, mean age 56.8 years, disease duration 13.2 years). From a societal perspective, PTM generated higher QALYs (mean +/- SD 0.068 +/- 0.22) and resulted in a higher mean cost ($6,848 Canadian, interquartile range [IQR] $1,984-$9,320) compared with TTM (mean +/- SD QALY -0.017 +/- 0.24; mean costs $6,266, IQR $1,938-$10,194) in 6 months, although differences were not statistically significant. The estimated ICE ratio was $13,700 per QALY gained (95% nonparametric confidence interval -$73,500, $230,000). CONCLUSION: The PTM has potential to be an alternative to traditional physical/occupational therapy, although it is premature to recommend widespread use of this model in other regions. Further research should focus on strategies to reduce costs of the model and assess the long-term economic consequences in managing RA and other rheumatologic conditions.",2006-01-02626,16739183,Arthritis Rheum,Linda C Li,2006,55 / 3,402-10,No,16739183,"Linda C Li; Andreas Maetzel; Aileen M Davis; Sydney C Lineker; Claire Bombardier; Peter C Coyte; Primary therapist model for patients referred for rheumatoid arthritis rehabilitation: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Arthritis Rheum, 2006-Jun-15; 55(3):0004-3591; 402-10",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Physical therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,11411.76,Canada,2002,10456.56

METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of providing inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine to all pregnant women. This scenario was compared with providing supportive care only on a case-by-case basis to the unvaccinated pregnant population. RESULTS: Vaccination of 100% of pregnant women would save approximately 50 dollars per woman, resulting in a net gain of approximately 45 quality-adjusted hours relative to providing supportive care only.

3540,Comprehensive cost-utility analysis of newborn screening strategies,"BACKGROUND: Inborn errors of metabolism are a significant cause of morbidity and death among children. Inconsistencies in how individual states arrive at screening strategies, however, lead to marked variations in testing between states. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of each component test of a multitest newborn screening program, including screening for phenylketonuria, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, congenital hypothyroidism, biotinidase deficiency, maple syrup urine disease, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. METHODS: A decision model was used, with cohort studies, government reports, secondary analyses, and other sources. Discounted costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were measured. RESULTS: All except 2 screening tests dominated the ""no-test"" strategy. The 2 exceptions were screening for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which cost slightly more than $20,000 per QALY gained, and screening for galactosemia, which cost $94,000 per QALY gained. The screening test with the lowest expected cost was tandem mass spectrometry. The results found in our base-case analysis were stable across variations in nearly all variables. In instances in which changes in risks, sequelae, costs, or utilities did affect our results, the variation from base-case estimates was quite large.

3548,Cost effectiveness of adding 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV-7) vaccine to the Norwegian childhood vaccination program,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a frequent bacterial cause of serious infections that may cause permanent sequelae and death. A 7-valent conjugate vaccine may reduce the incidence of pneumococcal disease, but some previous studies have questioned the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine. The aim of this study was to estimate costs and health consequences of adding this pneumococcal vaccine to the Norwegian childhood vaccination programme, taking the possibility of herd immunity into account. METHODS: We developed a simulation model (Markov-model) using data on the risk of pneumococcal disease in Norway, the efficacy of the vaccine as observed in clinical trials from other countries and adjusted for serotype differences, the cost of the vaccine and quality of life for patients with sequelae from pneumococcal disease. The results were expressed as incremental (additional) costs (in euros; euro1.00 approximately NOK8.37), incremental life years and incremental quality adjusted life years. Four different sets of main results are presented: costs and (quality adjusted) life years, with and without indirect costs (the value of lost production due to work absenteeism) and with and without potential herd immunity (i.e. childhood vaccination protects adults against pneumococcal disease). RESULTS: When indirect costs were disregarded, and four vaccine doses used, the incremental cost per life year gained was euro153,000 when herd immunity was included, and euro311,000 when it was not. When accounting for indirect costs as well, the cost per life year gained was euro58,000 and euro124,000, respectively. Assuming that three vaccine doses provide the same protection as four, the cost per life year gained with this regimen was euro90,000 with herd immunity and euro184,000 without (when indirect costs are disregarded). If indirect costs are also included, vaccination both saves costs and gains life years. INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSION: In Norway, governmental guidelines indicate that only interventions with cost per life year of less than euro54,000 should be implemented. This implies that four dose vaccination is not cost-effective even if decision makers includes both herd immunity and indirect costs in their decisions. If three doses offer the same protection as four doses, however, vaccination would be cost-saving when indirect costs are included, but not with only herd immunity. COMMENT: In the autumn of 2005, the Norwegian Government decided to include PCV-7 in the vaccination program. This analysis was used by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Finance during the decision process.",2006-01-02633,16735083,Vaccine,Torbjørn Wisløff,2006,24 / 29-30,5690-9,Yes,16735083,"Torbjørn Wisløff; Tore G Abrahamsen; Marianne A Riise Bergsaker; Øistein Løvoll; Per Møller; Maren Kristine Pedersen; Ivar Sønbø Kristiansen; Cost effectiveness of adding 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate (PCV-7) vaccine to the Norwegian childhood vaccination program, Vaccine, 2006-Jul-17; 24(29-30):1873-2518; 5690-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,140000,Norway,2004,28509.87
3549,Costs and benefits of bacterial culturing and pathogen reduction in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination is a life-threatening risk of blood transfusion, especially with platelet (PLT) transfusions. Bacterial culturing (BCU) of PLTs as well as pathogen reduction (PRT) reduce the likelihood of such contamination. The cost-effectiveness (CE) of these interventions was analyzed after the introduction of the diversion pouch during blood collection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The balance between costs and benefits of preventing adverse events due to PLT transfusion was assessed with a mathematical decision model and Monte Carlo simulations. Model parameters were obtained from the literature and from Dutch Sanquin blood banks. The balance between costs and benefits is assessed in terms of costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: The costs per 100,000 PLT concentrates in the Netherlands are estimated at $3,277,032 (euro2,520,794) for BCU and at $18,582,844 (euro14,294,495) for PRT. In comparison to the situation without BCU and PRT, costs per QALY are estimated at $90,697 (euro69,767) for BCU (95% confidence interval [CI], $18,149-$2,088,854) and at $496,674 (euro382,057) for PRT (95% CI, $143,950-$8,171,133). The ratio of differences in costs and QALYs between BCU and PRT (the relative CE) is estimated at $3,596,256 (euro2,766,351; 95% CI, $1,100,630-$24,756,615). Large uncertainty in sepsis complication rates and PLT recipient survival exist, causing large uncertainties in the absolute CE for both interventions.

3552,An evaluation of cost sharing to finance a diet and physical activity intervention to prevent diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention is a cost-effective strategy to prevent type 2 diabetes, but it is unclear how this intervention could be financed. We explored whether this intervention could be offered in a way that allows return on investment for private health insurers while remaining attractive for consumers, employers, and Medicare. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used the DPP and other published reports to build a Markov simulation model to estimate the lifetime progression of disease, costs, and quality of life for adults with impaired glucose tolerance. The model assumed a health-payer perspective and compared DPP lifestyle and placebo interventions. Primary outcomes included cumulative incidence of diabetes, direct medical costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, providing the lifestyle intervention at age 50 years could prevent 37% of new cases of diabetes before age 65, at a cost of $1,288 per QALY gained. A private payer could reimburse $655 (24%) of the $2,715 in total discounted intervention costs during the first 3 intervention years and still recover all of these costs in the form of medical costs avoided. If Medicare paid up to $2,136 in intervention costs over the 15-year period before participants reached age 65, it could recover those costs in the form of future medical costs avoided beginning at age 65. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-sharing strategies to offer the DPP lifestyle intervention for eligible people between ages 50 and 64 could provide financial return on investment for private payers and long-term benefits for Medicare.",2006-01-02636,16732002,Diabetes Care,Ronald T Ackermann,2006,29 / 6,1237-41,No,16732002,"Ronald T Ackermann; David G Marrero; Katherine A Hicks; Thomas J Hoerger; Stephen Sorensen; Ping Zhang; Michael M Engelgau; Robert E Ratner; William H Herman; An evaluation of cost sharing to finance a diet and physical activity intervention to prevent diabetes, Diabetes Care, 2006-Jun; 29(6):0149-5992; 1237-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) lifestyle intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,25 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1288,United States,2000,1935.82
3554,Value of quantitative D-dimer assays in identifying pulmonary embolism: implications from a sequential decision model,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost-effectiveness of a quantitative D-dimer assay for the evaluation of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) in an urban emergency department (ED). METHODS: The authors analyzed different diagnostic strategies over pretest risk categories on the basis of Wells criteria by using the performance profile of the ELISA D-dimer assay (over five cutoff values) and imaging strategies used in the ED for PE: compression ultrasound (CUS), ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan (over three cutoff values), CUS with VQ (over three cutoff values), computed tomography (CT) angiogram (CTA) with pulmonary portion (CTP) and lower-extremity venous portion, and CUS with CTP. Data used in the analysis were based on literature review. Incremental costs and quality-adjusted-life-years were the outcomes measured. RESULTS: Computed tomography angiogram with pulmonary portion and lower-extremity venous portion without D-dimer was the preferred strategy. CUS-VQ scanning always was dominated by CT-based strategies. When CTA was infeasible, the dominant strategy was D-dimer with CUS-VQ in moderate- and high-Wells patients and was D-dimer with CUS for low-Wells patients. When CTP specificity falls below 80%, or if its overall performance is markedly degraded, preferred strategies include D-dimer testing. Sensitivity analyses suggest that pessimistic assessments of CTP accuracy alter the results only at extremes of parameter settings. CONCLUSIONS: In patients in whom PE is suspected, when CTA is available, even the most sensitive quantitative D-dimer assay is not likely to be cost-effective.

3560,Cost-utility analysis of physiotherapy treatment compared with physiotherapy advice in low back pain,"STUDY DESIGN: Economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial from the National Health Service (NHS) and societal perspective. OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-utility analysis of routine physiotherapy treatment compared with an assessment session and advice from a physiotherapist for patients with subacute and chronic low back pain. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lack of evidence for some types of physiotherapy intervention and a paucity of cost-effectiveness data for treatment of low back pain has led to controversy and uncertainty within the medical and allied professions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 286 patients with low back pain of more than a 6-week duration were randomized to physiotherapy treatment or advice on remaining active from a physiotherapist. Data were collected on back pain-related NHS and patients' costs over a 12-month post randomization period. The primary outcome measure was the Oswestry Disability Index at 12 months, with additional Oswestry Disability Index measures at 2 and 6 months. The EuroQol EQ-5D was used to calculate quality adjusted life years. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained. Uncertainty was handled using confidence ellipses for the ratio and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: The total NHS costs were not significantly different at 179 pounds sterling (221 pounds sterling) for physiotherapy and 159 pounds sterling (260 pounds sterling) for the advice group. However, patients in the physiotherapy group had significantly higher out-of-pocket health care expenditure (40 pounds sterling, 95% confidence interval 9 pounds sterling to 71 pounds sterling). Utility levels improved in both groups from baseline to 12 months, with no significant differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate no significant differences in either NHS costs or effects. However, the significantly higher out-of-pocket expenses incurred by patients receiving routine physiotherapy suggests that advice given by a physiotherapist should be considered as the first-line treatment for patients with this level of back pain disability.",2006-01-02646,16721304,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Oliver Rivero-Arias,2006,31 / 12,1381-7,No,16721304,"Oliver Rivero-Arias; Alastair Gray; Helen Frost; Sarah E Lamb; Sarah Stewart-Brown; Cost-utility analysis of physiotherapy treatment compared with physiotherapy advice in low back pain, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , 2006-May-20; 31(12):1528-1159; 1381-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Standardized advice book (The Back Book) and physiotherapy - 5 1/2 sessions,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,1200,United Kingdom,2004,3013.66
3561,Cost-effectiveness of screening BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with breast magnetic resonance imaging,"CONTEXT: Women with inherited BRCA1/2 mutations are at high risk for breast cancer, which mammography often misses. Screening with contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects cancer earlier but increases costs and results in more false-positive scans. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with mammography plus breast MRI compared with mammography alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A computer model that simulates the life histories of individual BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, incorporating the effects of mammographic and MRI screening was used. The accuracy of mammography and breast MRI was estimated from published data in high-risk women. Breast cancer survival in the absence of screening was based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database of breast cancer patients diagnosed in the prescreening period (1975-1981), adjusted for the current use of adjuvant therapy. Utilization rates and costs of diagnostic and treatment interventions were based on a combination of published literature and Medicare payments for 2005. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The survival benefit, incremental costs, and cost-effectiveness of MRI screening strategies, which varied by ages of starting and stopping MRI screening, were computed separately for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. RESULTS: Screening strategies that incorporate annual MRI as well as annual mammography have a cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained ranging from less than 45,000 dollars to more than 700,000 dollars, depending on the ages selected for MRI screening and the specific BRCA mutation. Relative to screening with mammography alone, the cost per QALY gained by adding MRI from ages 35 to 54 years is 55,420 dollars for BRCA1 mutation carriers, 130,695 dollars for BRCA2 mutation carriers, and 98,454 dollars for BRCA2 mutation carriers who have mammographically dense breasts. CONCLUSIONS: Breast MRI screening is more cost-effective for BRCA1 than BRCA2 mutation carriers.

However, the cost of testing supplies is high, improvements in health utility due to improved glycaemic control may be possible and cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated. METHODS: A peer-reviewed validated model projected improvements in lifetime quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), long-term costs and cost-effectiveness of SMBG versus no SMBG. Markov/Monte Carlo modelling simulated the progression of complications (cardiovascular, neuropathy, renal and eye disease). Transition probabilities and HbA(1c)-dependent adjustments came from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) and other major studies. Effects of SMBG on HbA(1c) came from clinical studies, meta-analyses and population studies, but can only be considered 'moderate' levels of evidence. Costs of complications were retrieved from published sources. Direct costs of diabetes complications and SMBG were projected over patient lifetimes from a UK National Health Service perspective. Outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Depending on the type of diabetes treatment (diet and exercise/oral medications/insulin), improvements in glycaemic control with SMBG improved discounted QALYs anywhere from 0.165 to 0.255 years, with increased total costs of 1013 pounds sterlings- 2564 pounds sterlings/patient, giving incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 4508 pounds sterlings: 15,515 pounds sterlings/QALY gained, well within current UK willingness-to-pay limits.

3569,Comprehensive decision-analytic model and Bayesian value-of-information analysis: pentoxifylline in the treatment of chronic venous leg ulcers,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a Bayesian value-of-information analysis of the cost effectiveness of pentoxifylline (vs placebo) as an adjunct to compression for venous leg ulcers. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov model was developed to estimate mean clinical benefits and costs associated with oral pentoxifylline (400mg three times daily) and placebo. Clinical data were obtained from a systematic review and synthesised using Bayesian methods. The decision uncertainty associated with the adoption of pentoxifylline as well as the maximum value associated with further research were estimated before and after the completion of the largest 'definitive' treatment trial. Resource use was obtained from a UK national audit and unit costs applied (pounds, 2004 values). RESULTS: The prior and posterior analyses suggest that pentoxifylline is a dominant therapy versus placebo. In the prior analysis, patients in the pentoxifylline group healed an average of 8.28 weeks quicker than patients in the placebo group (95% credibility interval [CI] 1.89, 14.56), had a 0.02 gain in QALYs (95% CI -0.12, 0.17) and an average reduction in cost of 153.4 pounds (95% CI -53.11, 354.9). Estimates of the uncertainty surrounding the cost effectiveness of pentoxifylline and the value of perfect information in both analyses did not suggest further research was justified. In the prior analysis, for willingness-to-pay values of 0 pounds, 100 pounds and 500 pounds per QALY gained, the estimated values of perfect information were 128,200 pounds, 127,100 pounds and 126,700 pounds, respectively. Incorporation of the information from the largest randomised controlled trial on pentoxifylline did improve the estimate of the clinical effect associated with this drug; however, the variation was not large enough to reverse either the decision regarding the dominance of pentoxifylline or the maximum value associated with further research. CONCLUSION: Bayesian value-of-information analysis represents a valuable tool for healthcare decision making. Had the results from this analysis been available before the largest trial was funded, a more efficient allocation of research and development resources could have been made.",2006-01-02655,16706572,Pharmacoeconomics,Cynthia P Iglesias,2006,24 / 5,465-78,Yes,16706572,"Cynthia P Iglesias; Karl Claxton; Comprehensive decision-analytic model and Bayesian value-of-information analysis: pentoxifylline in the treatment of chronic venous leg ulcers, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(5):1179-2027; 465-78",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pentoxifylline 400mg three times daily,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,52 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,7670,United Kingdom,1998,20183.84
3570,Encouraging smokers to quit: the cost effectiveness of reimbursing the costs of smoking cessation treatment,"BACKGROUND: Smoking cessation should be encouraged in order to increase life expectancy and reduce smoking-related healthcare costs. Results of a randomised trial suggested that reimbursing the costs of smoking cessation treatment (SCT) may lead to an increased use of SCT and an increased number of quitters versus no reimbursement. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether reimbursement for SCT is a cost-effective intervention (from the Dutch societal perspective), we calculated the incremental costs per quitter and extrapolated this outcome to incremental costs per QALY saved versus no reimbursement. METHODS: In the reimbursement trial, 1266 Dutch smokers were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group using a randomised double consent design. Reimbursement for SCT was offered to the intervention group for a period of 6 months. No reimbursement was offered to the control group. Prolonged abstinence from smoking was determined 6 months after the end of the reimbursement period. The QALYs gained from quitting were calculated until 80 years of age using data from the US. Costs (year 2002 values) were determined from the societal perspective during the reimbursement period (May-November 2002). Benefits were discounted at 4% per annum. The uncertainty of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was estimated using non-parametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: Eighteen participants in the control group (2.8%) and 35 participants in the intervention group (5.5%) successfully quit smoking. The costs per participant were 291 euro and 322 euro, respectively. If society is willing to pay 1000 euro or 10,000 euro for an additional 12-month quitter, the probability that reimbursement for SCT would be cost effective was 50% or 95%, respectively. If society is willing to pay 18,000 euro for a QALY, the probability that reimbursement for SCT would be cost effective was 95%. However, the external validity of the extrapolation from quitters to QALYs is uncertain and several assumptions had to be made. CONCLUSION: Reimbursement for SCT may be cost effective if Dutch society is willing to pay 10,000 euro for an additional quitter or 18,000 euro for a QALY.",2006-01-02656,16706571,Pharmacoeconomics,Janneke Kaper,2006,24 / 5,453-64,Yes,16706571,"Janneke Kaper; Edwin J Wagena; Constant P van Schayck; Johan L Severens; Encouraging smokers to quit: the cost effectiveness of reimbursing the costs of smoking cessation treatment, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(5):1179-2027; 453-64",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Opportunity for reimbursement for smoking cessation therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,4.00,1802,Euro,2002,2450.84
3571,Cost effectiveness of increasing the dose intensity of chemotherapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in small-cell lung cancer: based on data from the Medical Research Council LU19 trial,"BACKGROUND: The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can enable dose intensification of chemotherapy in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, given its acquisition cost, it is important to assess its cost effectiveness within a resource-constrained health service. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness, from the UK NHS perspective, of G-CSF given in addition to doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide (ACE) versus ACE alone in the management of SCLC. METHODS: Using data from a UK Medical Research Council trial (LU19) to assess chemotherapy dose intensification in patients with previously untreated SCLC of any disease extent, a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken. Resource use data, including hospitalisations and non-protocol cancer treatments, were collected during the first 6-month treatment phase of the trial. Mean costs ( pound, 2003 values) of managing patients in the two arms of the trial were calculated. Mean survival duration was calculated for the two groups using patient-specific follow-up data collected in the trial. Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken, and uncertainty in cost effectiveness was expressed using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: The use of G-CSF in addition to ACE chemotherapy is more costly ( 4647 pounds) but results in longer mean survival duration (0.20 years; 0.18 years when discounted). This generates an incremental cost per additional life-year of 25,816 pounds for ACE + G-CSF therapy. The probability of the addition of G-CSF being cost effective, if decision makers are willing to pay 30,000 pounds for an additional life-year, is 0.57. Secondary analysis suggests that cost effectiveness is likely to be sensitive to assumptions about the health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) experienced by patients. CONCLUSION: Based on data collected in the LU19 trial, chemotherapy dose intensification using G-CSF in SCLC adds to health service costs but increases survival duration. Its overall cost effectiveness is likely to be finely balanced.",2006-01-02657,16706570,Pharmacoeconomics,Laura Bojke,2006,24 / 5,443-52,Yes,16706570,"Laura Bojke; Mark Sculpher; Richard Stephens; Wendi Qian; Nick Thatcher; David Girling; Cost effectiveness of increasing the dose intensity of chemotherapy with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in small-cell lung cancer: based on data from the Medical Research Council LU19 trial, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(5):1179-2027; 443-52",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide and etoposide (ACE)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,48735,United Kingdom,2003,112055.27
3573,Cost effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination at HIV counseling and testing sites,"BACKGROUND: Despite recent significant achievements in controlling hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, immunizing high-risk groups against the disease remains a public health challenge in the United States. The aims of this article are to evaluate the projected cost effectiveness of hepatitis B vaccination of adults attending two major types of publicly funded HIV counseling and testing sites (CTSs)-freestanding HIV CTSs and sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics, and to compare the cost-effectiveness of alternative vaccination and testing strategies in different subgroups in this population. METHODS: A decision model was developed to determine the economic and clinical consequences, from a societal perspective, of the following strategies in two hypothetical cohorts of 100,000 adults attending each type of site: (1) routine vaccination without screening, (2) screening for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen with an initial vaccine dose during the first visit, (3) screening and vaccination based on screening results, and (4) no intervention. Life expectancy, expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and medical care costs were estimated for each strategy and at each site. RESULTS: Routine vaccination was both more effective and more cost-effective than either screening strategy; under base-case assumptions, routine vaccination would cost $4400 both per QALY and per life year saved. Results for STD clinics were very similar in magnitude to those for freestanding CTSs. Results were most sensitive to clients' time and travel costs for return visits and the time-discount rate.

RESULTS: Routine vaccination was both more effective and more cost-effective than either screening strategy; under base-case assumptions, routine vaccination would cost $4400 both per QALY and per life year saved. Results for STD clinics were very similar in magnitude to those for freestanding CTSs. Results were most sensitive to clients' time and travel costs for return visits and the time-discount rate.

3582,A cost-utility analysis of pimecrolimus vs. topical corticosteroids and emollients for the treatment of mild and moderate atopic eczema,"BACKGROUND: Conventional treatments for atopic eczema include topical corticosteroids (TCS) and emollients. Pimecrolimus, an immunosuppressant, was licensed in the U.K. in 2003 as an alternative treatment of mild to moderate atopic eczema. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-utility of pimecrolimus as a treatment for mild and moderate atopic eczema when compared with conventional treatments which use TCS and emollients. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to represent the cyclical nature of atopic eczema and provide an economic analysis of cost-utility for treatment alternatives from the perspective of a third party payer (U.K. National Health Service). A range of methods was used to obtain data for transition probabilities, costs and quality of life. These included a systematic review of published effectiveness data, expert opinion, and a utility study conducted by the authors. Separate cohort analyses were modelled to distinguish between children and adult populations and between differing treatment patterns for facial and body eczema. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (using Monte-Carlo simulation) were performed. RESULTS: Baseline cost-utility outputs from the model show that, in all tested scenarios, TCS dominate pimecrolimus (i.e. TCS are both cheaper and more effective). However, the differences in benefits between treatments output by the model are very small. Sensitivity analyses highlight the importance of cost variations in pimecrolimus. Where pimecrolimus is compared with emollient only it is probably cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30 000 UK pounds per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSIONS: There are likely to be few situations in which the use of pimecrolimus for the treatment of atopic eczema can be justified on economic grounds. Exceptions are likely to be in cases where TCS have been shown to be ineffective, unacceptable due to adverse events, or where a patient is unwilling to accept TCS treatment despite appropriate education and support and emollient alone is the alternative clinical option.",2006-01-02660,16704646,Br J Dermatol,M Pitt,2006,154 / 6,1137-46,No,16704646,"M Pitt; R Garside; K Stein; A cost-utility analysis of pimecrolimus vs. topical corticosteroids and emollients for the treatment of mild and moderate atopic eczema, Br J Dermatol, 2006-Jun; 154(6):0007-0963; 1137-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pimecrolimus as second-line treatment,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,3.50,3.50,-4375.5,United Kingdom,2003,-10060.49

METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to represent the cyclical nature of atopic eczema and provide an economic analysis of cost-utility for treatment alternatives from the perspective of a third party payer (U.K. National Health Service). A range of methods was used to obtain data for transition probabilities, costs and quality of life. These included a systematic review of published effectiveness data, expert opinion, and a utility study conducted by the authors. Separate cohort analyses were modelled to distinguish between children and adult populations and between differing treatment patterns for facial and body eczema. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (using Monte-Carlo simulation) were performed. RESULTS: Baseline cost-utility outputs from the model show that, in all tested scenarios, TCS dominate pimecrolimus (i.e. TCS are both cheaper and more effective). However, the differences in benefits between treatments output by the model are very small. Sensitivity analyses highlight the importance of cost variations in pimecrolimus. Where pimecrolimus is compared with emollient only it is probably cost effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30 000 UK pounds per quality-adjusted life year. CONCLUSIONS: There are likely to be few situations in which the use of pimecrolimus for the treatment of atopic eczema can be justified on economic grounds. Exceptions are likely to be in cases where TCS have been shown to be ineffective, unacceptable due to adverse events, or where a patient is unwilling to accept TCS treatment despite appropriate education and support and emollient alone is the alternative clinical option.",2006-01-02660,16704646,Br J Dermatol,M Pitt,2006,154 / 6,1137-46,No,16704646,"M Pitt; R Garside; K Stein; A cost-utility analysis of pimecrolimus vs. topical corticosteroids and emollients for the treatment of mild and moderate atopic eczema, Br J Dermatol, 2006-Jun; 154(6):0007-0963; 1137-46",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pimecrolimus as first-line treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,3.50,3.50,-152000,United Kingdom,2003,-349490.13

3592,The routine use of high-resolution immunological screening of recipients of primary deceased donor kidney allografts is cost-effective,"BACKGROUND: The economic and health benefits of kidney transplantation are dependent on the length of allograft survival. High-resolution immunological screening can identify recipients at increased risk of early graft loss caused by acute rejection, but the use of these tests increases screening costs before transplantation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine use of high-resolution flow-cytometry cross-matching and solid-phase screening for all recipients of primary deceased donor kidney transplants. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to evaluate costs and effects of two different clinical strategies on a simulated cohort of 1,000 transplant recipients: serological screening (SS) only and flow screening (FS) only. Outcomes measures were total cost of patient care over 25 years, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and transplant life expectancy. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, FS was associated with an average gain of 0.08 life years, 0.25 transplant life years, and 0.08 quality-adjusted life years per patient. SS was associated with a higher cost of CND$6,397 per patient, mostly because of increased use of dialysis in patients who suffered early graft loss under the SS strategy. The results were robust to uncertainty in the majority of variables, and a strategy using FS was cost-effective except under the unlikely scenario where the false-negative rate for SS was <or=2% or the early graft loss rate for flow-positive recipients was <or=7% (compared with 5% for flow-negative recipients).

3593,Modelling the health benefits and economic implications of implanting dual-chamber vs. single-chamber ventricular pacemakers in the UK,"AIMS: To estimate the consequences of managing bradycardia due to sinoatrial node disease or atrioventricular block with dual-chamber vs. single-chamber ventricular pacemakers. METHODS AND RESULTS: A discrete-event simulation was conducted to predict outcomes over 5 years. Patients could develop post-operative complications, clinically relevant pacemaker syndrome leading to replacement of single-chamber with dual-chamber, atrial fibrillation (AF; which if chronic might require anticoagulants) or stroke. Survival, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), complications, and associated direct medical costs were estimated (2003 British Pounds pounds sterling). Identical patients were simulated after receiving a single-chamber device or a more expensive dual-chamber pacemaker. Probabilities of conditions were obtained from clinical trials. Benefits were discounted at 1.5% and costs at 6%. Post-operative complications increased from 6.4% with single-chamber to 7.7% with dual-chamber but AF decreased (22 vs. 18%) as did clinically relevant pacemaker symptoms (16.8 vs. 0%). Approximately 4300 pounds sterling were accrued per patient over 5 years. Additional health benefits with dual-chamber are achieved at a mean net cost of 43 pounds sterling per patient, leading to 0.09 QALY with a cost-effectiveness ratio of 477 pounds sterling/QALY. CONCLUSION: Implanting the costlier device increases the cost of the initial operation; however, this is expected to be offset by a reduction in costs associated with re-operations and AF.",2006-01-02664,16690630,Europace,Jaime Caro,2006,8 / 6,449-55,No,16690630,"Jaime Caro; Alexandra Ward; Jorgen Moller; Modelling the health benefits and economic implications of implanting dual-chamber vs. single-chamber ventricular pacemakers in the UK, Europace, 2006-Jun; 8(6):1099-5129; 449-55",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dual chamber pace maker,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,6.00,1.50,477,United Kingdom,2003,1096.76

3600,Cost-effectiveness of continuous positive airway pressure therapy for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea (OSAH) is a common disorder characterized by recurrent collapse of the upper airway during sleep, and is associated with an increased risk of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs). Common first-line therapy for OSAH is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of CPAP therapy vs none for the treatment of OSAH. METHODS: We used a 5-year Markov model that considers the costs and quality-of-life improvements of CPAP therapy, accounting for the gains from reduced MVC rates. Utility values were obtained from published studies. The MVC rates under the CPAP and no-CPAP scenarios were calculated from National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data and a systematic review of published studies. Costs of MVCs, equipment, and physicians were obtained from US Medicare and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The target population included male and female patients aged 25 to 54 years and newly diagnosed as having moderate to severe OSAH. We examined the findings from the perspectives of a third-party payer and society. RESULTS: From a third-party payer or a societal perspective, CPAP therapy was more effective but more costly than no CPAP, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $3354 or $314 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio estimate was most dependent on viewpoint (varying more than 10-fold between societal and third-party payer perspectives) and choice of utility measurement method (varying more than 5-fold between the use of standard gamble and EuroQol 5D utility assessment values).
