28501,The Impact and Cost-effectiveness of Strategies to Detect Drug Resistant Tuberculosis.,"Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a serious emerging problem in many low resource countries. TB control programs are uncertain which drug susceptibility tests (DST) to use and when to test patients. We predicted the potential cost-effectiveness of different DST strategies, in settings with varying prevalence of drug resistance. Using decision analysis, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of conventional and rapid DST for already diagnosed smear positive TB cases. Five different time points were considered for administering DST. Different initial drug resistance and HIV scenarios were also considered. All DST scenarios in the wide range of settings considered were found to be cost-effective. The strategy of performing a rapid DST that detects any form of isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin (RIF) resistance for all patients before the initiation of treatment was predicted to be the most cost-effective strategy. In a setting with moderate drug resistance, the cost per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) gained was as low as $744.

28513,Cost-effectiveness of community-based management of acute malnutrition in Malawi,"This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) to prevent deaths due to severe acute malnutrition among children under-five. The analysis used a decision tree model to compare the costs and effects of two options to treat severe acute malnutrition: existing health services with CMAM vs existing health services without CMAM. The model used outcome and cost data from a CMAM programme in Dowa district, Malawi and a set of key assumptions regarding treatment-seeking behaviour and mortality outcomes. Under our 'base case' scenario, we found that CMAM cost US$42 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted (2007 US$) and US$493 per DALY averted under an assumed 'worst case' scenario for each variable. The results suggest that CMAM was highly cost-effective in the 'base case' as defined by the World Health Organization, as the cost per DALY falls well below Malawi's 2007 gross national income (GNI) per capita of US$250, and is within the range of DALYs reported for other child health interventions. Under a hypothetical 'worst case' for all variables, the model indicates CMAM is still cost-effective. The results indicate the decision to scale-up CMAM within essential health services in Dowa was a cost-effective one and that scaling up CMAM in similar contexts is also likely to be cost-effective. However, several contextual and programmatic factors should be considered when generalizing to diverse contexts.",2011-99-07452,21378101,Health Policy Plan,Robyn Wilford,2011,/,,No,21378101,"Robyn Wilford; Kate Golden; Damian G Walker; Cost-effectiveness of community-based management of acute malnutrition in Malawi, Health Policy Plan, 2011-Mar-04; ():0268-1080",DALY,Malawi,Not Stated,Other,Community-based management of acute malnutrition vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,42,United States,2007,52.43
28514,Cost-effectiveness of introducing the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine into the universal immunisation of infants in Brazil,"Background Cost-effectiveness studies have been increasingly part of decision processes for incorporating new vaccines into the Brazilian National Immunisation Program. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) in the universal childhood immunisation programme in Brazil. Methods A decision-tree analytical model based on the ProVac Initiative pneumococcus model was used, following 25 successive cohorts from birth until 5&emsp14;years of age. Two strategies were compared: (1) status quo and (2) universal childhood immunisation programme with PCV10. Epidemiological and cost estimates for pneumococcal disease were based on National Health Information Systems and literature. A 'top-down' costing approach was employed. Costs are reported in 2004 Brazilian reals. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3%. Results 25&emsp14;years after implementing the PCV10 immunisation programme, 10?226 deaths, 360?657 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), 433?808 hospitalisations and 5?117?109 outpatient visits would be avoided. The cost of the immunisation programme would be R$10?674?478?765, and the expected savings on direct medical costs and family costs would be R$1?036?958?639 and R$209?919?404, respectively. This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of R$778?145/death avoided and R$22?066/DALY avoided from the society perspective. Conclusion The PCV10 universal infant immunisation programme is a cost-effective intervention (1-3 GDP per capita/DALY avoided).

28515,Economic analysis for evidence-based policy-making on a national immunization program: A case of rotavirus vaccine in Thailand,"Severe diarrhea caused by rotavirus is a health problem worldwide, including Thailand. The World Health Organization has recommended incorporating rotavirus vaccination into national immunization programs. This policy has been implemented in several countries, but not in Thailand where the mortality rate is not high. This leads to the question of whether it would be cost-effective to implement such a policy. The Thai National Vaccine Committee, through the Immunization Practice Subcommittee, has conducted an economic analysis. Their study aimed to estimate the costs of rotavirus diarrhea and of a rotavirus vaccination program, and the cost-effectiveness of such a program including budget impact analysis. The study was designed as an economic evaluation, employing modeling technique in both provider and societal perspectives. A birth cohort of Thai children in 2009 was used in the analysis, with a 5-year time horizon. Costs were composed of cost of the illness and the vaccination program. Outcomes were measured in the form of lives saved and DALYs averted. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. The study found the discounted number of deaths to be 7.02 and 20.52 for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively (13.5 deaths averted). Discounted DALYs were 263.33 and 826.57 for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively (563.24 DALYs averted). Costs of rotavirus diarrhea in a societal perspective were US$6.6 million and US$21.0 million for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively. At base case, the costs per additional death averted were US$5.1 million and US$5.7 for 2-dose and 3-dose vaccines, respectively, in a societal perspective. Costs per additional DALYs averted were US$128,063 and US$142,144, respectively. In a societal perspective, with a cost-effectiveness threshold at 1 GDP per capita per DALYs averted, vaccine prices per dose were US$4.98 and US$3.32 for 2-dose and 3-dose vaccines, respectively; in a provider perspective, they were US$2.90 and US$1.93. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were included. The budget required for vaccine purchase was calculated for all scenarios. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012-01-04246,22387220,Vaccine,,2012,30 /,2839-2847,Yes,22387220,"Ana Lucia Danielewicz; Aline Rodrigues Barbosa; Giovani Firpo Del Duca; Denizar Vianna Araujo; Vanessa Teich; Roberta Benitez Freitas Passos; Sheila Cristina Ouriques Martins; David G.

28517,Economic analysis for evidence-based policy-making on a national immunization program: A case of rotavirus vaccine in Thailand,"Severe diarrhea caused by rotavirus is a health problem worldwide, including Thailand. The World Health Organization has recommended incorporating rotavirus vaccination into national immunization programs. This policy has been implemented in several countries, but not in Thailand where the mortality rate is not high. This leads to the question of whether it would be cost-effective to implement such a policy. The Thai National Vaccine Committee, through the Immunization Practice Subcommittee, has conducted an economic analysis. Their study aimed to estimate the costs of rotavirus diarrhea and of a rotavirus vaccination program, and the cost-effectiveness of such a program including budget impact analysis. The study was designed as an economic evaluation, employing modeling technique in both provider and societal perspectives. A birth cohort of Thai children in 2009 was used in the analysis, with a 5-year time horizon. Costs were composed of cost of the illness and the vaccination program. Outcomes were measured in the form of lives saved and DALYs averted. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. The study found the discounted number of deaths to be 7.02 and 20.52 for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively (13.5 deaths averted). Discounted DALYs were 263.33 and 826.57 for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively (563.24 DALYs averted). Costs of rotavirus diarrhea in a societal perspective were US$6.6 million and US$21.0 million for vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, respectively. At base case, the costs per additional death averted were US$5.1 million and US$5.7 for 2-dose and 3-dose vaccines, respectively, in a societal perspective. Costs per additional DALYs averted were US$128,063 and US$142,144, respectively. In a societal perspective, with a cost-effectiveness threshold at 1 GDP per capita per DALYs averted, vaccine prices per dose were US$4.98 and US$3.32 for 2-dose and 3-dose vaccines, respectively; in a provider perspective, they were US$2.90 and US$1.93.

28518,Generalized Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Pharmaceutical Interventions for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Thailand,"Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of blood pressure (BP)-lowering and cholesterol-lowering drugs for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Methods:We constructed a Markov model in which the Thai population was classified by 10-year absolute CVD risk and modeled the use of BP- and cholesterol-lowering drugs, including a ""--polypill"" (three BP-lowering drugs and a statin). We applied ""--do-nothing"" as the comparator, a health sector perspective on lifetime cost-effectiveness, 3% discounting of costs and effects, and used probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Outcomes are expressed as average and incremental cost-effectiveness in Thai baht per disability-adjusted life-year averted. Results: The polypill would be a very cost-effective option for CVD prevention even in people at modest risk (10-year risk of 5%-9.9%). Use of the three most cost-effective BP drugs is also associated with a net cost saving and large health gain at risk levels greater than 5%. Adding a generic statin gives a price per disability-adjusted life-year of 0.5 (10-year risk at 20%+) to 1.5 (10-year risk at 5%-9.9%) times Thai per-capita gross domestic product using lowest available annual costs. However, at current average drug prices, adding a statin would be considered cost-effective only for those with a 10-year absolute CVD risk of 20% and more.

28529,Generalized Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Pharmaceutical Interventions for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Thailand,"Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of blood pressure (BP)-lowering and cholesterol-lowering drugs for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Methods:We constructed a Markov model in which the Thai population was classified by 10-year absolute CVD risk and modeled the use of BP- and cholesterol-lowering drugs, including a ""--polypill"" (three BP-lowering drugs and a statin). We applied ""--do-nothing"" as the comparator, a health sector perspective on lifetime cost-effectiveness, 3% discounting of costs and effects, and used probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Outcomes are expressed as average and incremental cost-effectiveness in Thai baht per disability-adjusted life-year averted. Results: The polypill would be a very cost-effective option for CVD prevention even in people at modest risk (10-year risk of 5%-9.9%). Use of the three most cost-effective BP drugs is also associated with a net cost saving and large health gain at risk levels greater than 5%. Adding a generic statin gives a price per disability-adjusted life-year of 0.5 (10-year risk at 20%+) to 1.5 (10-year risk at 5%-9.9%) times Thai per-capita gross domestic product using lowest available annual costs. However, at current average drug prices, adding a statin would be considered cost-effective only for those with a 10-year absolute CVD risk of 20% and more.

28541,Generalized Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Pharmaceutical Interventions for Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Thailand,"Objectives: To assess the cost-effectiveness of blood pressure (BP)-lowering and cholesterol-lowering drugs for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Methods:We constructed a Markov model in which the Thai population was classified by 10-year absolute CVD risk and modeled the use of BP- and cholesterol-lowering drugs, including a ""--polypill"" (three BP-lowering drugs and a statin). We applied ""--do-nothing"" as the comparator, a health sector perspective on lifetime cost-effectiveness, 3% discounting of costs and effects, and used probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Outcomes are expressed as average and incremental cost-effectiveness in Thai baht per disability-adjusted life-year averted. Results: The polypill would be a very cost-effective option for CVD prevention even in people at modest risk (10-year risk of 5%-9.9%).

28553,Assessing Zambia's industrial fortification options: getting beyond changes in prevalence and cost-effectiveness,"Background. Since fortification of sugar with vitamin A was mandated in 1998, Zambia''s fortification program has not changed, while the country remains plagued by high rates ofmicronutrient deficiencies. Objective. To provide evidence-based fortification options with the hope of reinvigorating the Zambian fortification program. Methods. Zambia''s 2006 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey is used to estimate the apparent intakes of vitamin A, iron, and zinc, as well as the apparent consumption levels and coverage of four fortification vehicles. Fourteen alternativefoodfortification portfolios are modeled, and their costs, impacts, average cost-effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness are calculated using three alternative impact measures. Results. Alternative impact measures result in different rank orderings of the portfolios. The most cost-effective portfolio is vegetable oil, which has a cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved ranging from 12% to 25% of that of sugar, depending on the impact measure used. The public health impact of fortified vegetable oil, however, is relatively modest. Additional criteria beyond cost-effectiveness are introduced and used to rank order the portfolios. The size of the public health impact, the total cost, and the incremental cost-effectiveness of phasing in multiple vehicle portfolios over time are analyzed. Conclusions. Assessing fortification portfolios by measuring changes in the prevalence of inadequate intakes underestimates impact. A more sensitive measure, which also takes into account change in the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) gap, is provided by a dose-response-based approach to estimating the number ofDALYs saved.

Since fortification of sugar with vitamin A was mandated in 1998, Zambia''s fortification program has not changed, while the country remains plagued by high rates ofmicronutrient deficiencies. Objective. To provide evidence-based fortification options with the hope of reinvigorating the Zambian fortification program. Methods. Zambia''s 2006 Living Conditions Monitoring Survey is used to estimate the apparent intakes of vitamin A, iron, and zinc, as well as the apparent consumption levels and coverage of four fortification vehicles. Fourteen alternativefoodfortification portfolios are modeled, and their costs, impacts, average cost-effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness are calculated using three alternative impact measures. Results. Alternative impact measures result in different rank orderings of the portfolios. The most cost-effective portfolio is vegetable oil, which has a cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) saved ranging from 12% to 25% of that of sugar, depending on the impact measure used. The public health impact of fortified vegetable oil, however, is relatively modest. Additional criteria beyond cost-effectiveness are introduced and used to rank order the portfolios. The size of the public health impact, the total cost, and the incremental cost-effectiveness of phasing in multiple vehicle portfolios over time are analyzed. Conclusions.

28564,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a voucher scheme combined with obstetrical quality improvements: quasi experimental results from Uganda,"The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Uganda has declined significantly during the last 20 years, but Uganda is not on track to reach the millennium development goal of reducing MMR by 75% by 2015. More evidence on the cost-effectiveness of supply- and demand-side financing programs to reduce maternal mortality could inform future strategies. This study analyses the cost-effectiveness of a voucher scheme (VS) combined with health system strengthening in rural Uganda against the status quo. The VS, implemented in 2010, provided vouchers for delivery services at public and private health facilities (HF), as well as round-trip transportation provided by private sector workers (bicycles or motorcycles generally). The VS was part of a quasi-experimental non-randomized control trial. Improvements in institutional delivery coverage (IDC) rates can be estimated using a difference-in-difference impact evaluation method and the number of maternal lives saved is modelled using the evidence-based Lives Saved Tool. Costs were estimated from primary and secondary data. Results show that the demand for births at HFs enrolled in the VS increased by 52.3 percentage points. Out of this value, conservative estimates indicate that at least 9.4 percentage points are new HF users. This 9.4% bump in IDC implies 20 deaths averted, which is equivalent to 1356 disability-adjusted-life years (DALYs) averted. Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the status quo and VS''s most conservative effectiveness estimates shows that the VS had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per DALY averted of US$302 and per death averted of US$20 756. Although there are limitations in the data measures, a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio persists even under extreme assumptions. Demand-side vouchers combined with supply-side financing programs can increase attended deliveries and reduce maternal mortality at a cost that is acceptable.",2013-99-14933,24371219,Health Policy Plan,Y Natalia Alfonso,2015,30 / 1,,No,24371219,"Y Natalia Alfonso; David Bishai; John Bua; Aloysius Mutebi; Crispus Mayora; Elizabeth Ekirapa-Kiracho; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a voucher scheme combined with obstetrical quality improvements: quasi experimental results from Uganda, Health Policy Plan, 2015 Feb; 30(1):0268-1080",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care,Voucher scheme for delivery services at public and private health facilities plus obstetrical quality improvements vs. Standard/Usual Care,pregnant,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,302,United States,2010,358.44

28567,Cost-effectiveness analysis of breast cancer control interventions in Peru,"OBJECTIVES: In Peru, a country with constrained health resources, breast cancer control is characterized by late stage treatment and poor survival. To support breast cancer control in Peru, this study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of different breast cancer control interventions relevant for the Peruvian context. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) according to WHO-CHOICE guidelines, from a healthcare perspective. Different screening, early detection, palliative, and treatment interventions were evaluated using mathematical modeling. Effectiveness estimates were based on observational studies, modeling, and on information from Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN). Resource utilizations and unit costs were based on estimates from INEN and observational studies. Cost-effectiveness estimates are in 2012 United States dollars (US$) per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. RESULTS: The current breast cancer program in Peru ($8,426 per DALY averted) could be improved through implementing triennial or biennial screening strategies. These strategies seem the most cost-effective in Peru, particularly when mobile mammography is applied (from $4,125 per DALY averted), or when both CBE screening and mammography screening are combined (from $4,239 per DALY averted). Triennially, these interventions costs between $63 million and $72 million per year. Late stage treatment, trastuzumab therapy and annual screening strategies are the least cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that breast cancer control in Peru should be oriented towards early detection through combining fixed and mobile mammography screening (age 45-69) triennially. However, a phased introduction of triennial CBE screening (age 40-69) with upfront FNA in non-urban settings, and both CBE (age 40-49) and fixed mammography screening (age 50-69) in urban settings, seems a more feasible option and is also cost-effective.

Effectiveness estimates were based on observational studies, modeling, and on information from Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN). Resource utilizations and unit costs were based on estimates from INEN and observational studies. Cost-effectiveness estimates are in 2012 United States dollars (US$) per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. RESULTS: The current breast cancer program in Peru ($8,426 per DALY averted) could be improved through implementing triennial or biennial screening strategies. These strategies seem the most cost-effective in Peru, particularly when mobile mammography is applied (from $4,125 per DALY averted), or when both CBE screening and mammography screening are combined (from $4,239 per DALY averted). Triennially, these interventions costs between $63 million and $72 million per year. Late stage treatment, trastuzumab therapy and annual screening strategies are the least cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis suggests that breast cancer control in Peru should be oriented towards early detection through combining fixed and mobile mammography screening (age 45-69) triennially. However, a phased introduction of triennial CBE screening (age 40-69) with upfront FNA in non-urban settings, and both CBE (age 40-49) and fixed mammography screening (age 50-69) in urban settings, seems a more feasible option and is also cost-effective.

28585,Cost-effectiveness analysis of breast cancer control interventions in Peru,"OBJECTIVES: In Peru, a country with constrained health resources, breast cancer control is characterized by late stage treatment and poor survival. To support breast cancer control in Peru, this study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of different breast cancer control interventions relevant for the Peruvian context. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) according to WHO-CHOICE guidelines, from a healthcare perspective. Different screening, early detection, palliative, and treatment interventions were evaluated using mathematical modeling. Effectiveness estimates were based on observational studies, modeling, and on information from Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN). Resource utilizations and unit costs were based on estimates from INEN and observational studies. Cost-effectiveness estimates are in 2012 United States dollars (US$) per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. RESULTS: The current breast cancer program in Peru ($8,426 per DALY averted) could be improved through implementing triennial or biennial screening strategies. These strategies seem the most cost-effective in Peru, particularly when mobile mammography is applied (from $4,125 per DALY averted), or when both CBE screening and mammography screening are combined (from $4,239 per DALY averted).

The implementation of this intervention is only meaningful if awareness raising, diagnostic, referral, treatment and basic palliative services are simultaneously improved, and if financial and organizational barriers to these services are reduced.",2013-99-14900,24349314,PLoS One,Sten G Zelle,2013,8 / 12,e82575,No,24349314,"Sten G Zelle; Tatiana Vidaurre; Julio E Abugattas; Javier E Manrique; Gustavo Sarria; Jose Jeronimo; Janice N Seinfeld; Jeremy A Lauer; Cecilia R Sepulveda; Diego Venegas; Rob Baltussen; Cost-effectiveness analysis of breast cancer control interventions in Peru, PLoS One , ; 8(12):1932-6203; e82575",DALY,Peru,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical, Screening",Stage I to IV treatment with triennial CBE (clinical breast examination) screening vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,5675,United States,2012,6397.17
28596,Cost-effectiveness analysis of breast cancer control interventions in Peru,"OBJECTIVES: In Peru, a country with constrained health resources, breast cancer control is characterized by late stage treatment and poor survival. To support breast cancer control in Peru, this study aims to determine the cost-effectiveness of different breast cancer control interventions relevant for the Peruvian context. METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) according to WHO-CHOICE guidelines, from a healthcare perspective. Different screening, early detection, palliative, and treatment interventions were evaluated using mathematical modeling. Effectiveness estimates were based on observational studies, modeling, and on information from Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplasicas (INEN). Resource utilizations and unit costs were based on estimates from INEN and observational studies. Cost-effectiveness estimates are in 2012 United States dollars (US$) per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. RESULTS: The current breast cancer program in Peru ($8,426 per DALY averted) could be improved through implementing triennial or biennial screening strategies. These strategies seem the most cost-effective in Peru, particularly when mobile mammography is applied (from $4,125 per DALY averted), or when both CBE screening and mammography screening are combined (from $4,239 per DALY averted). Triennially, these interventions costs between $63 million and $72 million per year. Late stage treatment, trastuzumab therapy and annual screening strategies are the least cost-effective.
