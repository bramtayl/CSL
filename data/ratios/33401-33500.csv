33401,Cost-effectiveness of live-attenuated influenza vaccination among school-age children,"The current pediatric vaccination program in England and Wales administers Live-Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) to children ages 2-16 years old. Annual administration of LAIV to this age group is costly and poses substantial logistical issues. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of prioritizing vaccination to age groups within the 2-16 year old age range to mitigate the operational and resource challenges of the current strategy. We performed economic evaluations comparing the influenza vaccination program from 1995-2013 to seven alternative strategies targeted at low risk individuals along the school age divisions Preschool (2-4 years old), Primary school (5-11 years old), and Secondary school (12-16 years old). These extensions are evaluated incrementally on the status quo scenario (vaccinating subgroups at high risk of influenza-related complications and individuals 65+ years old). Impact of vaccination was assessed using a transmission model from a previously published study and updated with new data. At all levels of coverage, all strategies had a 100% probability of being cost-effective at the current National Health Service threshold, £20,000/QALY gained. The incremental analysis demonstrated vaccinating Primary School children was the most cost-efficient strategy compared incrementally against others with an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio of £639 spent per QALY gained (Net Benefit: 404 M£ [155, 795]). When coverage was varied between 30%, 55%, and 70% strategies which included Primary school children had a higher probability of being cost-effective at lower willingness-to-pay levels.

33404,"The cost-effectiveness of glasdegib in combination with low-dose cytarabine, for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia in adult patients who are not eligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy in Canada","AIM: The clinical efficacy and safety of DAURISMO (glasdegib) combined with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) were demonstrated in the BRIGHT AML 1003 study among newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients who are not eligible to receive intensive chemotherapy. This study aims to evaluate its cost-effectiveness versus LDAC alone and azacitidine from a Canadian payer perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned-survival model was developed with three health states: progression-free survival (PFS), relapse/progression and death. Clinical inputs were obtained from the BRIGHT AML 1003 study for glasdegib and LDAC, and from the two trial publications and indirect treatment comparison for azacitidine. Drug acquisition/administration, disease management, adverse event and end-of-life costs were considered. All costs were measured in Canadian dollars. Cost-effectiveness of glasdegib?+?LDAC was assessed against LDAC alone in main population, and against azacitidine by bone marrow blasts (BMB). A weighted average ICER was calculated to represent the current treatment use of Canadian clinical practice. The reference-case analysis was conducted probabilistically, and numerous probabilistic scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared to LDAC alone was CAD $177,065 (a mean gain of 0.41 QALYs and an incremental cost of CAD $72,695), to azacitidine in 20-30% and >30% BMB group were CAD $178,201 (a mean gain of 0.34 QALYs and an incremental cost of CAD $59,889) and dominant (a mean gain of 0.28 QALYs while reducing costs by CAD $7,856) respectively, resulting in a weighted average ICER of CAD $81,310 per QALY.

33407,Cost Effectiveness of Introducing Etonorgestrel Contraceptive Implant into India's Current Family Welfare Programme,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to provide evidence to policy makers on cost effectiveness and budget impact for the introduction of the etonorgestrel implant into the Indian public health system. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted to ascertain the potential costs and outcomes of adding the etonorgestrel implant to the public health system of India as compared to the current scenario. A decision analytical model (Markov cohort) was conceptualized from a societal perspective, where a hypothetical population of 15-year-old females was followed until menopause. The primary outcome was incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). Sources for model inputs included country-level secondary data analysis, government reports, an observational primary costing study, a systematic review of etonorgestrel implant and targeted literature reviews. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (OWSA and PSA) were performed to account for uncertainty. The impact of etonorgestrel implant introduction on the annual Indian health budget was also analysed. RESULTS: The base-case ICUR was 16,475 Indian rupees (INR) (USD 232) per quality-adjusted life-year gained, which showed the etonorgestrel implant to be very cost effective (ICUR below willingness-to-pay threshold of INR 137,945 [USD 1943]). OWSA showed that discount rate, percentage of people who do not use contraceptives and costs of managing side effects were the important parameters that affected ICUR. PSA showed that ICUR values of all 1000 Monte Carlo simulations were cost effective. Budget impact analysis showed that introduction of the implant would account for?<?1% of the total annual health budget of India, even if acceptance of the implant varied between 0.2 and 4%.

The objective of this study was to compare the economic implications of DOACs and VKAs using data from real-world evidence in patients with AF. METHODS: A Markov model simulating the lifetime course of patients diagnosed with non-valvular AF was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DOACs (i.e., rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban) versus VKAs from the Italian National Health System (INHS) perspective. The model was made up of data from the literature and a meta-analysis of RWE on the incidence of stroke/systemic embolism (SE), major bleeding (MB), intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and all-cause mortality (ACM); direct costs included drug costs, costs for drug monitoring, and management of events from official national lists. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were used to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Results from the meta-analysis showed that apixaban had a high probability of being the most effective for stroke/SE, MB and ACM. Despite their higher acquisition costs, the cost-effectiveness analysis showed all DOACs involved a saving when compared with VKAs, with per-patient savings ranging between €4647 (rivaroxaban) to €6086 (apixaban).

33411,Smart Insulin Pens are Associated with Improved Clinical Outcomes at Lower Cost Versus Standard-of-Care Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes in Sweden: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Real-world evidence has demonstrated improved glycemic control and insulin management following introduction of smart insulin pens in a Swedish type 1 diabetes (T1D) population. To understand the implications for healthcare costs and expected health outcomes, this analysis evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of introducing smart insulin pens to standard-of-care T1D treatment (standard care) from a Swedish societal perspective. METHODS: Clinical outcomes and healthcare costs (in 2018 Swedish krona, SEK) were projected over patients'' lifetimes using the IQVIA CORE Diabetes Model to estimate cost-effectiveness. Clinical data and baseline characteristics for the simulated cohort were informed by population data and a prospective, noninterventional study of a smart insulin pen in a Swedish T1D population. This analysis captured direct and indirect costs, mortality, and the impact of diabetes-related complications on quality of life. RESULTS: Over patients'' lifetimes, smart insulin pen use was associated with per-patient improvements in mean discounted life expectancy (+?0.90 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (+?1.15 quality-adjusted life-years), in addition to mean cost savings (direct, SEK 124,270; indirect, SEK 373,725), versus standard care.

33413,"The cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole compared to voriconazole, the standard of care in the treatment of patients with invasive mould diseases, prior to differential pathogen diagnosis in Spain","BACKGROUND: Invasive mould diseases are associated with high morbidity, mortality and economic impact. Its treatment is often started prior to differential pathogen diagnosis. Isavuconazole is approved for treatment of invasive aspergillosis (IA) and invasive mucormycosis (IM) when amphotericin-B is not indicated. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole vs voriconazole for the treatment of adult patients with possible IA prior to differential pathogen diagnosis, in Spain. METHODS: A decision tree analysis was performed using the Spanish Healthcare System perspective. Among all patients with possible IA, it was considered that 7.81% actually had IM. Costs for laboratory analysis, management of adverse events, hospitalisation and drugs per patient, deaths and long-term effects in life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) were considered. Efficacy data were obtained from clinical trials and utilities from the literature. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) were conducted. RESULTS: In patients with possible IA and when compared to voricanozole, isavuconazole showed an incremental cost of 4758.53€, besides an incremental effectiveness of +0.49 LYs and +0.41 QALYs per patient. The Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratio was 9622.52€ per LY gained and 11,734.79€ per QALY gained. The higher cost of isavuconazole was due to drug acquisition. Main parameters influencing results were mortality, treatment duration and hospitalisation days. The PSA results showed that isavuconazole has a probability of being cost-effective of 67.34%, being dominant in 24.00% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Isavuconazole is a cost-effective treatment compared to voriconazole for patients with possible IA for a willingness to pay threshold of 25,000€ per additional QALY.",2021-01-35208,32989796,Mycoses,José Ramón Azanza,2021,64 / 1,66-77,No,32989796,"José Ramón Azanza; Santiago Grau; Lourdes Vázquez; Pablo Rebollo; Carmen Peral; Alejandra López-Ibáñez de Aldecoa; Vanessa López-Gómez; The cost-effectiveness of isavuconazole compared to voriconazole, the standard of care in the treatment of patients with invasive mould diseases, prior to differential pathogen diagnosis in Spain, Mycoses, 2021 Jan; 64(1):1439-0507; 66-77",QALY,Spain,"Mycoses, Mycoses, Malignant neoplasms, stated or presumed to be primary, of lymphoid, haematopoietic and related tissue",Pharmaceutical,isavuconazole vs. voriconazole,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,11734.79,Euro,2020,14033.21
33414,Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is a cost saving strategy for prevention of acute coronary syndrome,"OBJECTIVE: There is evidence that the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) may reduce cardiovascular disease. We aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of PPV for primary prevention of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the elderly in Australia. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to investigate the costs, QALYs and ICERs of PPV administration in those aged =65 years without a history of ACS from the perspective of Australian healthcare system, using elderly-specific clinical data and local costs from Australian Heart Foundation and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare databases. A ten-years horizon was used, and all costs and health outcomes were discounted at 5% annually. The impact of various assumptions was tested with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, interventional strategy (100% PPV coverage) prevented an additional five incident ACS events among 1000 ""healthy"" elderly individuals compared with standard of care (50% PPV coverage) over 10 years. 100% PPV was the dominant strategy, resulting in a QALY gain of 0.0075 and cost saving of AU$ 179 per person. The results were most sensitive to effectiveness of PPV at preventing ACS and reducing hospital bed-days, and cost of ACS admission, but in all sensitivity analyses 100% PPV remained the dominant strategy. Shortening the time horizon from ten to five years resulted in further cost saving. CONCLUSION: PPV for the prevention of ACS in those aged =65 is a dominant intervention strategy, with cost saving and minor improvements in QALY.

33415,Applicability and cost-effectiveness of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) in the Chinese population: A cost-effectiveness modeling study,"BACKGROUND: The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) showed significant reductions in death and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of <120 mm Hg compared with a SBP goal of <140 mm Hg. Our study aimed to assess the applicability of SPRINT to Chinese adults. Additionally, we sought to predict the medical and economic implications of this intensive SBP treatment among those meeting SPRINT eligibility. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used nationally representative baseline data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) (2011-2012) to estimate the prevalence and number of Chinese adults aged 45 years and older who meet SPRINT criteria. A validated microsimulation model was employed to project costs, clinical outcomes, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) among SPRINT-eligible adults, under 2 alternative treatment strategies (SBP goal of <120 mm Hg [intensive treatment] and SBP goal of <140 mm Hg [standard treatment]). Overall, 22.2% met the SPRINT criteria, representing 116.2 (95% CI 107.5 to 124.8) million people in China. Of these, 66.4%, representing 77.2 (95% CI 69.3 to 85.0) million, were not being treated for hypertension, and 22.9%, representing 26.6 (95% CI 22.4 to 30.7) million, had a SBP between 130 and 139 mm Hg, yet were not taking antihypertensive medication. We estimated that over 5 years, compared to standard treatment, intensive treatment would reduce heart failure incidence by 0.84 (95% CI 0.42 to 1.25) million cases, reduce CVD deaths by 2.03 (95% CI 1.44 to 2.63) million cases, and save 3.84 (95% CI 1.53 to 6.34) million life-years. Estimated reductions of 0.069 (95% CI -0.28, 0.42) million myocardial infarction cases and 0.36 (95% CI -0.10, 0.82) million stroke cases were not statistically significant. Furthermore, over a lifetime, moving from standard to intensive treatment increased the mean QALYs from 9.51 to 9.87 (an increment of 0.38 [95% CI 0.13 to 0.71]), at a cost of Int$10,997 per QALY gained. Of all 1-way sensitivity analyses, high antihypertensive drug cost and lower treatment efficacy for CVD death resulted in the 2 most unfavorable results (Int$25,291 and Int$18,995 per QALY were gained, respectively). Simulation results indicated that intensive treatment could be cost-effective (82.8% probability of being below the willingness-to-pay threshold of Int$16,782 [1× GDP per capita in China in 2017]), with a lower probability in people with SBP 130-139 mm Hg (72.9%) but a higher probability among females (91.2%). Main limitations include lack of specific SPRINT eligibility information in the CHARLS survey, uncertainty about the implications of different blood pressure measurement techniques, the use of several sources of data with large reliance on findings from SPPRINT, limited information about the serious adverse event rate, and lack of information and evidence for medication effectiveness on renal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Although adoption of the SPRINT treatment strategy would increase the number of Chinese adults requiring SBP treatment intensification, this approach has the potential to prevent CVD events, to produce gains in life-years, and to be cost-effective under common thresholds.",2021-01-35213,33661907,PLoS Med,Chao Li,2021,18 / 3,e1003515,No,33661907,"Chao Li; Kangyu Chen; Victoria Cornelius; Ewan Tomeny; Yang Wang; Xiaowei Yang; Xiaodan Yuan; Rui Qin; Dahai Yu; Zhenqiang Wu; Duolao Wang; Tao Chen; Applicability and cost-effectiveness of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) in the Chinese population: A cost-effectiveness modeling study, PLoS Med, 2021 Mar; 18(3):1549-1676; e1003515",QALY,China,Hypertensive diseases,"Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical",intensive systolic blood pressure treatment vs. standard treatment for systolic blood pressure,"systolic blood pressure from 130–180 mm Hg on any number of antihypertensive medication classes, presence of 1 or more high cardiovascular disease risk conditions, no diabetes, a history of stroke, heart failure, or end-stage renal disease",Not Stated,50 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"5 Years, Lifetime",3.00,3.00,9816.67,International,2017,10851.92

33498,Cost-Utility Analysis of Home Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a disease with rapid progression. The use of mechanical ventilation helps to manage symptoms and delays death. Use in a home environment could reduce costs and increase quality of life. The aim of this study is a cost-utility analysis of home mechanical ventilation in adult patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from the perspective of healthcare payers in the Czech Republic. The study evaluates home mechanical ventilation (HMV) and mechanical ventilation (MV) in a healthcare facility. A Markov model was compiled for evaluation in a timeframe of 10 years. Model parameters were obtained from the literature and opinions of experts from companies dealing with home care and home mechanical ventilation. The cost-utility analysis was carried out at the end of the study and results are presented in incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) using quality-adjusted life-years. Uncertainty was assessed by one-way sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The cumulative costs of HMV are CZK 1,877,076 and the cumulative costs of the MV are CZK 7,386,629. The cumulative utilities of HMV are 12.57 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and the cumulative utilities of MV are 11.32 QALY. The ICUR value is CZK-4,403,259. The results of this study suggest that HMV is cost effective.",2021-01-34317,33535635,Healthcare (Basel),Ondrej Gajdoš,2021,9 / 2,,No,33535635,"Ondrej Gajdoš; Martin Rožánek; Gleb Donin; Vojtech Kamenský; Cost-Utility Analysis of Home Mechanical Ventilation in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Healthcare (Basel), 2021 Feb 1; 9(2):2227-9032",QALY,Czech Republic,Systemic atrophies primarily affecting the central nervous system,Medical Device,Home mechanical ventilation vs. mechanical ventilation in a healthcare facility,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"10 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,-4403259,Czech Republic,2020,-199157.4
33499,Cost-effectiveness of pertuzumab and trastuzumab biosimilar combination therapy as initial treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Singapore,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of pertuzumab with trastuzumab biosimilar and docetaxel as initial treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in Singapore. METHODS: A partitioned survival model with three health states was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of trastuzumab biosimilar and docetaxel with or without pertuzumab from a healthcare system perspective over a 15-year time horizon for patients with HER2-positive MBC. Key clinical inputs were derived from the CLEOPATRA trial. Health state utilities were derived from the literature and direct medical costs were obtained from local public healthcare institutions. RESULTS: The base-case resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of SGD366,658 (USD272,244) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the ICER was sensitive to utilities in the progression-free state, price of pertuzumab and time horizon. When the price for trastuzumab reference biologic (branded) was applied, the ICER was even higher (SGD426,996 [USD317,045]/QALY). CONCLUSION: Although trastuzumab biosimilar reduced the cost of the pertuzumab combination regimen, the ICER remained high and was not cost effective in Singapore''s context. As pertuzumab contributed 80% of the overall combination treatment cost, price reductions for pertuzumab will be required to improve the cost-effectiveness of combination treatment to an acceptable level.",2021-01-34494,33595372,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,Li-Jen Cheng,2021,/,1-8,No,33595372,"Li-Jen Cheng; Lydia Loke; Elaine Hsuen Lim; Fiona Pearce; Mohamed Ismail Abdul Aziz; Kwong Ng; Cost-effectiveness of pertuzumab and trastuzumab biosimilar combination therapy as initial treatment for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Singapore, Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res, 2021 Feb 1; ():1744-8379; 1-8",QALY,Singapore,"Malignant neoplasms, breast and female genital organs",Pharmaceutical,pertuzumab vs. trastuzumab,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,Female,Full,"15 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,366658,Singapore,2019,284916.84
33500,Cost-effectiveness of FRAX®-based intervention thresholds for management of osteoporosis in Singaporean women,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of FRAX® intervention thresholds (ITs) in Singaporean women > 50 years of age showed that generic alendronate was cost-effective at age-dependent major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) IT from the ages of 65 years for both full and real-world adherence whilst hip fracture (HF) ITs were cost-effective from the ages of 60 and 65 years. Alendronate was cost-effective irrespective of age only at fixed MOF IT of 14% and HF IT of 3.5%. INTRODUCTION: FRAX®-based intervention thresholds (ITs) were recently identified for osteoporosis management in Singapore. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of ITs in Singaporean women over the age of 50 years. METHODS: A validated Markov microsimulation model was used to estimate the lifetime healthcare costs (SGD2019) per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of generic alendronate compared with no treatment. Cost-effectiveness of age-dependent FRAX® major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) and hip fracture (HF) ITs was explored. In addition, ITs that would lead to cost-effectiveness were computed. Fracture incidence and cost data were obtained from the Ministry of Health and a previously published Singaporean study. A cost-effectiveness threshold of SGD 62,500/QALY gained was used, based conservatively on 0.7 times the Singapore GDP per capita. RESULTS: Generic alendronate was shown to be cost-effective at MOF ITs from the ages of 65 years, while HF ITs were cost-effective from the ages of 60 and 65 years, assuming full and real-world adherence, respectively. A 14% MOF and a 3.5% HF ITs were required for alendronate to be cost-effective above 50 years. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the treatment of Singaporean women with alendronate is cost-effective at age-dependant FRAX® intervention thresholds at 65 years and older. Furthermore, identifying women at any age above 50 years with a 10-year risk of MOF or HF of 14% or 3.5% would lead to efficient use of resources. Cost-effective access to therapy for patients at high fracture probability based on FRAX® could contribute to reduce the growing burden of osteoporotic fractures in Singapore.",2021-01-34872,32797250,Osteoporos Int,M Chandran,2021,32 / 1,133-144,No,32797250,"M Chandran; G Ganesan; K B Tan; J-Y Reginster; M Hiligsmann; Christian Brettschneider; Jochen Gensichen; Thomas S Hiller; Jörg Breitbart; Ulrike Schumacher; Karoline Lukaschek; Tobias Teismann; Jürgen Margraf; Hans-Helmut König; Cost-effectiveness of FRAX®-based intervention thresholds for management of osteoporosis in Singaporean women, Osteoporos Int, 2021 Jan; 32(1):0937-941X; 133-144",QALY,Singapore,Disorders of bone density and structure,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical",major osteoporotic fracture intervention threshold 2.86% plus alendronate vs. No treatment,,50 Years,50 Years,Female,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,307248,Singapore,2019,238751.45
