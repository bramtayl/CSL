26401,Packaging health services when resources are limited: the example of a cervical cancer screening visit,"Increasing evidence supporting the value of screening women for cervical cancer once in their lifetime, coupled with mounting interest in scaling up successful screening demonstration projects, present challenges to public health decision makers seeking to take full advantage of the single-visit opportunity to provide additional services. We present an analytic framework for packaging multiple interventions during a single point of contact, explicitly taking into account a budget and scarce human resources, constraints acknowledged as significant obstacles for provision of health services in poor countries.We developed a binary integer programming (IP) model capable of identifying an optimal package of health services to be provided during a single visit for a particular target population. Inputs to the IP model are derived using state-transition models, which compute lifetime costs and health benefits associated with each intervention. In a simplified example of a single lifetime cervical cancer screening visit, we identified packages of interventions among six diseases that maximized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted subject to budget and human resource constraints in four resource-poor regions. Data were obtained from regional reports and surveys from the World Health Organization, international databases, the published literature, and expert opinion. With only a budget constraint, interventions for depression and iron deficiency anemia were packaged with cervical cancer screening, while the more costly breast cancer and cardiovascular disease interventions were not. Including personnel constraints resulted in shifting of interventions included in the package, not only across diseases but also between low- and high-intensity intervention options within diseases.The results of our example suggest several key themes: Packaging other interventions during a one-time visit has the potential to increase health gains; the shortage of personnel represents a real-world constraint that can impact the optimal package of services; and the shortage of different types of personnel may influence the contents of the package of services. Our methods provide a general framework to enhance a decision maker's ability to simultaneously consider costs, benefits, and important nonmonetary constraints. We encourage analysts working on real-world problems to shift from considering costs and benefits of interventions for a single disease to exploring what synergies might be achievable by thinking across disease burdens.",2006-XX-12830,17105337,PLoS Med,Jane J Kim,2006,3 / 11,e434,No,17105337,"Jane J Kim; Joshua A Salomon; Milton C Weinstein; Sue J Goldie; Packaging health services when resources are limited: the example of a cervical cancer screening visit, PLoS Med, ; 3(11):1549-1676; e434",DALY,"Algeria, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo Democratic Republic, Comoros, Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe",Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Diagnostic, Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical, Screening, Surgical, Other","Triple drug therapy consists of beta-blockers, statins, aspirin. for cardiovascular disease vs. None",Not Stated,64 Years,19 Years,Female,Full,,3.00,3.00,2177.14,United States,2001,3181.64

However, evidence regarding the feasibility, effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness of DOTS-Plus is still limited.We evaluated the feasibility, effectiveness, cost, and cost-effectiveness of a DOTS-Plus pilot project established at Makati Medical Center in Manila, the Philippines, in 1999. Patients with MDR-TB are treated with regimens, including first- and second-line drugs, tailored to their drug susceptibility pattern (i.e., individualised treatment). We considered the cohort enrolled between April 1999 and March 2002. During this three-year period, 118 patients were enrolled in the project; 117 were considered in the analysis. Seventy-one patients (61%) were cured, 12 (10%) failed treatment, 18 (15%) died, and 16 (14%) defaulted. The average cost per patient treated was US3,355 dollars from the perspective of the health system, of which US1,557 dollars was for drugs, and US837 dollars from the perspective of patients. The mean cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) gained by the DOTS-Plus project was US242 dollars (range US85 dollars to US426 dollars).Treatment of patients with MDR-TB using the DOTS-Plus strategy and individualised drug regimens can be feasible, comparatively effective, and cost-effective in low- and middle-income countries.",2006-99-12768,16968123,PLoS Med,Thelma E Tupasi,2006,3 / 9,e352,No,16968123,"Thelma E Tupasi; Rajesh Gupta; Ma Imelda D Quelapio; Ruth B Orillaza; Nona Rachel Mira; Nellie V Mangubat; Virgil Belen; Nida Arnisto; Lualhati Macalintal; Michael Arabit; Jaime Y Lagahid; Marcos Espinal; Katherine Floyd; Feasibility and cost-effectiveness of treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a cohort study in the Philippines, PLoS Med, ; 3(9):1549-1676; e352",DALY,Philippines,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical","DOTS-Plus project- chronic cases of MDR-TB referred from public or private facilities and cases with a diagnosis of MDR-TB during treatment with the first-line retreatment regimen vs. Chronic MDR-TB cases: no treatment, or limited treatment based on affordability in the private sector, standard first line treatment for MDR-TB",Not Stated,64 Years,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,Not Stated,151.46,United States,2002,217.9

The cost-effectiveness of three interventions (vaccination, highly active antiretroviral treatment [HAART], and the combination of the two) through an existing vaccination program was assessed in a Markov model. The disability-adjusted life year (DALY) was the main effectiveness measure. In the base case the efficacy of the vaccine for preventing HIV infection was assumed to be 30%. The cost of the vaccine was estimated on the basis of its predicted production capacities in Thailand. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of vaccination, HAART, and the combination were about dollar US 75, dollar US 610, and dollar US 267 per DALY averted compared with the do-nothing strategy in the base case.

26448,The cost-effectiveness of alternative polio immunization policies in South Africa,"AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of switching from oral polio vaccine (OPV) to inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), or to cease polio vaccination in routine immunization services in South Africa at the time of OPV cessation globally following polio eradication. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of nine different polio immunization alternatives were evaluated. The costs of introducing IPV in a separate vial as well as in different combination vaccines were estimated, and IPV schedules with 2, 3 and 4 doses were compared with the current 6-dose OPV schedule. Assumptions about IPV prices were based on indications from vaccine manufacturers. The health impact of OPV cessation was measured in terms of vaccine associated paralytic paralysis (VAPP) cases and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. CONCLUSIONS: The use of OPV in routine immunization services is predicted to result in 2.96 VAPP cases in the 2005 cohort. The cost-effectiveness of the different IPV alternatives varies between US$ 740,000 and US$ 7.2 million per VAPP case averted. The costs per discounted DALY averted amount to between US$ 61,000 and US$ 594,000. Among the IPV strategies evaluated, the 2-dose schedule in a 10-dose vial is the most cost-effective option. At the assumed vaccine prices, all IPV options do not appear to be cost-effective in the South African situation. OPV cessation without IPV replacement would result in cost savings of US$ 1.6 million per year compared to the current situation.

A mathematical model, fitted to epidemiologic data, projected the HIV and STIs averted by the intervention. Cost per HIV infection and DALY averted were estimated for different general population HIV prevalences.Projections suggest 53 HIV infections were averted (July 2000-June 2001) and a 3.1% decrease in the FSW HIV incidence. Cost-effectiveness was US dollars 78 per DALY averted. Incremental cost of PPT was US dollars 31 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Initiating the intervention at 15% general HIV prevalence would have improved cost-effectiveness by 35%. Expanding PPT coverage to mass-treat all FSWs (instead of <17%) and their clients could increase impact 14-fold.The results highlight targeted interventions can be cost-effective at all stages of HIV epidemics and suggests PPT could improve the cost-effectiveness of targeted STI interventions.",2006-99-12671,16735954,Sex Transm Dis,Peter Vickerman,2006,33 / 10 Suppl,S122-32,No,16735954,"Peter Vickerman; Fern Terris-Prestholt; Sinead Delany; Lilani Kumaranayake; Helen Rees; Charlotte Watts; Are targeted HIV prevention activities cost-effective in high prevalence settings?

26458,Cost-effectiveness of home-based chlorination and safe water storage in reducing diarrhea among HIV-affected households in rural Uganda,"Safe water systems (SWSs) have been shown to reduce diarrhea and death. We examined the cost-effectiveness of SWS for HIV-affected households using health outcomes and costs from a randomized controlled trial in Tororo, Uganda. SWS was part of a home-based health care package that included rapid diarrhea diagnosis and treatment of 196 households with relatively good water and sanitation coverage. SWS use averted 37 diarrhea episodes and 310 diarrhea-days, representing 0.155 disability-adjusted life year (DALY) gained per 100 person-years, but did not alter mortality. Net program costs were 5.21 dollars/episode averted, 0.62 dollars/diarrhea-day averted, and 1,252 dollars/DALY gained. If mortality reduction had equaled another SWS trial in Kenya, the cost would have been 11 dollars/DALY gained. The high SWS cost per DALY gained was probably caused by a lack of mortality benefit in a trial designed to rapidly treat diarrhea.

26459,The cost-effectiveness of improving malaria home management: shopkeeper training in rural Kenya,"Home management is a very common approach to the treatment of illnesses such as malaria, acute respiratory infections, tuberculosis, diarrhoea and sexually transmitted infections, frequently through over-the-counter purchase of drugs from shops. Inappropriate drugs and doses are often obtained, but interventions to improve treatment quality are rare. An educational programme for general shopkeepers and communities in Kilifi District, rural Kenya was associated with major improvements in the use of over-the-counter anti-malarial drugs for childhood fevers. The two main components were workshop training for drug retailers and community information activities, with impact maintained through on-going refresher training, monitoring and community mobilization. This paper presents the cost and cost-effectiveness of the programme in terms of additional appropriately treated cases, evaluating both its measured cost-effectiveness in the first area of implementation (early implementation phase) and the estimated cost-effectiveness of the programme recommended for district-level implementation (recommended district programme). The proportion of shop-treated childhood fevers receiving an adequate amount of a recommended antimalarial rose from 2% to 15% in the early implementation phase, at an economic cost of 4.00 US dollars per additional appropriately treated case (2000 US dollars). If the same impact were achieved through the recommended district programme, the economic cost per additional appropriately treated case would be 0.84 US dollars, varying between 0.37 US dollars and 1.36 US dollars in the sensitivity analysis. As with most educational approaches, the programme carries a relatively high initial financial cost, of 11,477 US dollars (0.02 per capita US dollars) for the development phase and 81,450 US dollars (0.17 per capita US dollars) for the set up year, which would be particularly suitable for donor funding, while the annual costs of 18,129 US dollars (0.04 per capita US dollars) thereafter could be contained within the budget of a typical District. To reach the Abuja target of 60% of those suffering from malaria in sub-Saharan Africa having access to affordable and appropriate treatment within 24 hours, improvements in community-based malaria treatment are urgently required. From these results, policymakers can estimate costs for district-scale shopkeeper training programmes, and will be able to assess their relative cost-effectiveness as comparable evaluations become available from home management interventions in the future.

DESIGN: Cost-benefit analysis from the company's perspective of three interventions to treat HIV-infected employees. METHODS: The costs and benefits of each intervention were compared with no intervention and with each other: cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (CTX) starting at WHO stage 2; highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) plus CTX starting at WHO stage 2; and a 'hybrid' strategy that begins with CTX at WHO stage 2 and later includes HAART. The 5-year health and economic outcomes were calculated using a Markov model. Inputs for disease progression rates and effects of HIV on company costs were derived from published and unpublished data and a survey administered to company officers. RESULTS: The analysis showed that the 'hybrid' intervention is the most cost-effective. For 100 skilled employees it would save the company 38,939 US dollars and 73 disability adjusted life-years (DALYs). For unskilled workers 'CTX' is the most cost effective and would save 16,417 US dollars and 60 DALYs. 'Hybrid' has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 45 US dollars per DALY for unskilled workers whereas HAART is far less economical at an incremental cost per DALY of 4118 US dollars. For 'CTX', net savings are preserved across the full range of input values.

26465,Cost/DALY averted in a small hospital in Sierra Leone: what is the relative contribution of different services?,"BACKGROUND: A cost-effective analysis (CEA) can be a useful tool to guide resource allocation decisions. However, there is a dearth of evidence on the cost/disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted by health facilities in the developing world. METHODS: We conducted a study to calculate the costs and the DALYs averted by an entire hospital in Sierra Leone, using the method suggested by McCord and Chowdhury (Int J Gynaecol Obstet 2003;81:83-92). RESULTS: For the 3-month study period, total costs were calculated to be dollar 369,774. Using the approach of McCord and Chowdhury, we calculated that 11,282 DALYs were averted during the study period, resulting in a cost/DALY averted of dollar 32.78. This figure compares favorably to other non-surgical health interventions in developing countries. We found that while surgery accounts for 63% of total caseload, it contributes to 38% of the total DALYs averted. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of some common pathologies in developing countries may be more cost-effective than previously thought, and our results provide evidence for the inclusion of surgery as part of the basic public health armamentarium in developing countries. However, these results are highly context-specific, and more research is needed from developing countries to further refine the methodology and analysis.",2006-99-02763,16528459,World J Surg,Richard A Gosselin,2006,30 / 4,505-11,No,16528459,"Richard A Gosselin; Amardeep Thind; Andrea Bellardinelli; Cost/DALY averted in a small hospital in Sierra Leone: what is the relative contribution of different services?, World J Surg, 2006-Apr; 30(4):0364-2313; 505-11",DALY,Sierra Leone,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Surgical",All services provided by new NGO surgical hospital in a three month period. vs. None,Adult and pediatric patients at a surgical hospital.,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,32.78,United States,2004,44.91
26466,"Economic gains of a home fortification program: evaluation of ""Sprinkles"" from the provider's perspective","INTRODUCTION: This paper models the effects of a home-fortification program (using Sprinkles which contain zinc and iron and other micronutrients), in Pakistan, a country with high levels of infant mortality, anemia, and diarrhea. It uses the results of randomized trials of the effect of Sprinkles on anemia and on longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea. METHODS: Based on previous literature, the effect of Sprinkles on intermediate outcomes (diarrhea and anemia) is linked to longer-term outcomes (infant and young child mortality, and cognitive achievement and hence adult wages). Three different measures of cost effectiveness are presented: the cost per death averted (effect via zinc supplementation on reduction of longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea); the cost per 'disability adjusted life year' (DALY) saved (same modality); and the gain in earnings due to higher cognitive functioning for each dollar spent (effect via iron supplementation on reduced anemia). RESULTS: We estimated that the cost per death averted is dollars406 (dollars273-dollars3248), the cost per DALY saved is dollars12.2 (dollars8-dollars97) and the present value of the gain in earnings is dollars37 (dollars18-dollars51) for each dollar spent on the Sprinkles program. These estimates were developed for a low-income country (GDP per capita = dollars417) with a high infant mortality rate (IMR = 83/1000), high prevalence of anemia (93%), and high mean longitudinal prevalence of diarrhea (17%). DISCUSSION: These outcomes are particularly favourable in Pakistan. The outcomes are more favourable when used with children 6-12 months. Further longer-run field trials of Sprinkles with larger populations would be helpful.",2006-99-02779,16512321,Can J Public Health,Waseem Sharieff,2006,97 / 1,20-3,No,16512321,"Waseem Sharieff; Susan E Horton; Stanley Zlotkin; Economic gains of a home fortification program: evaluation of ""Sprinkles"" from the provider's perspective, Can J Public Health, 2006 Jan-Feb; 97(1):0008-4263; 20-3",DALY,Pakistan,Not Stated,Other,"60 Sprinkles (zinc, iron and other micronutrients) sachets are provided to households with young children vs. None",Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,12.2,United States,2002,17.55

We developed a mathematical simulation model of breast cancer using the stage distribution and case fatality rates in the presence and absence of treatment as predictors of survival. Outcome measures were life-years adjusted for disability (DALYs), costs (in 2000 U.S. dollars) of treatment and follow-up, and cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs; in dollars per DALY averted). Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of the results. Treating patients with stage I breast cancer resulted in 23.41, 12.25, and 19.25 DALYs averted per patient in Africa, North America, and Asia, respectively. The corresponding average CERs compared with no intervention were 78 U.S. dollars , 1,960 U.S. dollars, and 62 U.S. dollars per DALY averted. The number of DALYs averted per patient decreased with stage; the value was lowest for stage IV treatment (0.18-0.19), with average CERs of 4,986 U.S. dollars in Africa, 70,380 U.S. dollars in North America, and 3,510 U.S. dollars per DALY averted in Asia. An extensive breast cancer program resulted in 16.14, 12.91, and 12.58 DALYs averted per patient and average CERs of 75 U.S. dollars, 915 U.S. dollars, and 75 U.S. dollars per DALY averted.

METHODS: We adopt an ingredients based approach to form models of what each intervention would cost in 6 world regions over a 10 year period discounted at both 3% and 6% from both the governmental and societal perspectives. Costs are expressed in local currency converted into US $2001. Prior studies have established the effectiveness of each of these interventions in a single LMIC. These effectiveness estimates have been used to form models of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted for various regions, taking account of regional differences in the baseline burden of injury. RESULTS: All of the interventions modeled in this paper are relatively cost-effective ranging with societal cost per DALY ranging from US $ 5 to $ 556 per DALY averted depending on region. Enhanced enforcement of traffic regulations is the most cost-effective interventions with an average cost per DALY of $64 CONCLUSIONS: Injury counter measures appear to be cost-effective based on models.

26500,"Economic evaluation of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccination in Moscow, Russian Federation","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of providing Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine to children in Moscow in routine immunization services. METHODS: The incidence of Hib meningitis among children aged <5 years in Moscow was obtained from a prospective surveillance study undertaken during October 1999-September 2001, with treatment cost data collected for all cases. Sequelae in surviving children were assessed in December 2002. The costs of Hib vaccination in Moscow were estimated assuming a vaccine price of US dollar 5 per dose and the same four-dose schedule and 97% coverage as for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine. The most uncertain variables were varied in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The annual incidence of Hib meningitis was 5.7 per 100,000 children <5 years. The average treatment cost for an acute Hib meningitis case was US dollar 1296. For a patient with sequelae, the average additional lifetime discounted treatment cost was US dollar 15,820. The total annual cost of Hib vaccination of infants in Moscow was estimated as US dollar 1.5 million per year. In the base case analysis, the cost-effectiveness ratios amount to US dollar 77,503 per Hib meningitis case averted and US dollar 10,842 per discounted disability adjusted life year averted. The break-even vaccine price, where the annual vaccination costs equal annual treatment costs averted, is only US dollar 0.04 per dose in the base case scenario. If discounted indirect costs are included, the break-even vaccine price is US dollar 0.5 per dose. CONCLUSION: In Moscow, the incidence of Hib meningitis is low and the costs of hospitalization and subsequent medical treatment are relatively inexpensive. Given these factors, Hib vaccine at US dollar 5 per dose would not be a cost-effective option in Moscow at the present time.",2006-99-01552,16413949,Vaccine,A E Platonov,2005,24 / 13,2367-76,Yes,16413949,"A E Platonov; U K Griffiths; M V Voeykova; O V Platonova; I L Shakhanina; G G Chistyakova; S E Robertson; U K Griffiths; M V Voeykova; O V Platonova; I L Shakhanina; G G Chistyakova; S E Robertson; Economic evaluation of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccination in Moscow, Russian Federation, Vaccine, 2006-Mar-20; 24(13):1873-2518; 2367-76",DALY,Russia,Not Stated,Immunization,Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine included in routine childhood immunization services vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,10842,United States,2001,15844.32
