14401,The cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based regimens for treatment of hepatitis C virus genotype 2 or 3 infection,"BACKGROUND: Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 or 3 can be treated with sofosbuvir without interferon. Because sofosbuvir is costly, its benefits should be compared with the additional resources used. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir-based treatments for HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection in the United States. DESIGN: Monte Carlo simulation, including deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. DATA SOURCES: Randomized trials, observational cohorts, and national health care spending surveys. TARGET POPULATION: 8 patient types defined by HCV genotype (2 vs. 3), treatment history (naive vs. experienced), and cirrhosis status (noncirrhotic vs. cirrhotic). TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Payer. INTERVENTION: Sofosbuvir-based therapies, pegylated interferon-ribavirin, and no therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based treatment was less than $100,000 per QALY in cirrhotic patients (genotype 2 or 3 and treatment-naive or treatment-experienced) and in treatment-experienced noncirrhotic patients but was greater than $200,000 per QALY in treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The ICER of sofosbuvir-based therapy for treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients with genotype 2 or 3 infection was less than $100,000 per QALY when the cost of sofosbuvir was reduced by approximately 40% and 60%, respectively. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, cost-effectiveness conclusions were robust to uncertainty in treatment efficacy. LIMITATION: The analysis did not consider possible benefits of preventing HCV transmission. CONCLUSION: Sofosbuvir provides good value for money for treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3 infection and those with cirrhosis. At their current cost, sofosbuvir-based regimens for treatment-naive noncirrhotic patients exceed willingness-to-pay thresholds commonly cited in the United States.

14406,The cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus sulfonylurea as an add-on to metformin in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus,"AIMS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor, compared with a sulfonylurea, when added to metformin for treatment of UK people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on metformin alone. METHODS: Clinical inputs sourced from a head-to-head randomized controlled trial (RCT) informed the Cardiff diabetes decision model. Risk equations developed from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) were used in conjunction with the clinical inputs to predict disease progression and the incidence of micro- and macrovascular complications over a lifetime horizon. Cost and utility data were generated to present the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for both treatment arms, and sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted to assess the impact of uncertainty on the final model results. RESULTS: The dapagliflozin treatment arm was associated with a mean incremental benefit of 0.467 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.420; 0.665], with an incremental cost of pound1246 (95% CI: pound613; pound1637). This resulted in an ICER point estimate of pound2671 per QALY gained. Incremental costs were shown to be insensitive to parameter variation, with only treatment-related weight change having a significant impact on the incremental QALYs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis determined that dapagliflozin had a 100% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Dapagliflozin in combination with metformin was shown to be a cost-effective treatment option compared with sulfonylurea from a UK healthcare perspective for people with Type 2 diabetes mellitus who are inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.",2015-01-18424,25817050,Diabet Med,M Charokopou,2015,32 / 7,890-8,No,25817050,"M Charokopou; P McEwan; S Lister; L Callan; K Bergenheim; K Tolley; R Postema; R Townsend; M Roudaut; The cost-effectiveness of dapagliflozin versus sulfonylurea as an add-on to metformin in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Diabet Med, 2015 Jul; 32(7):0742-3071; 890-8",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dapagliflozin added to metfomin therapy vs. Sulfonylurea added to metfomin therapy,Inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,2671,United Kingdom,2011,4930.35
14407,Adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy impact on clinical and economic outcomes for Medicaid enrollees with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C coinfection,"We examined the impact of antiretroviral treatment adherence among hepatitis C (HCV) coinfected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients on survival and clinical outcomes. We analyzed Medicaid claims data from 14 southern states from 2005 to 2007, comparing survival and clinical outcomes and cost of treatment for HIV and HCV coinfected patients (N = 4115) at different levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). More than one in five patients (20.5%) showed less than 50% adherence to antiretroviral treatment, but there were no racial/ethnic or gender disparities. Significant survival benefit was demonstrated at each incremental level of adherence to ART (one-year mortality ranging from 3.5% in the highest adherence group to 26.0% in the lowest). Low-adherence patients also had higher rates of hospitalization and emergency department visits. Relative to patients with high (>95%) ART adherence, those with less than 25% treatment adherence had fourfold greater risk of death (adjusted odds ratio 4.22 [95% CI: 3.03, 5.87]). Nondrug Medicaid expenditures were lower for high-adherence patients, but cost of medications drove total Medicaid expenditures higher for high-adherence patients. Cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved (relative to the <25% low-adherence group) ranged from $21,874 for increasing adherence to 25-50% to $37,229 for increasing adherence to 75-95%.

14411,The cost effectiveness of the DIEP flap relative to the muscle-sparing TRAM flap in postmastectomy breast reconstruction,"BACKGROUND: The deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap has gained notoriety because of its proposed benefit in decreasing donor-site morbidity but has been associated with longer operative times, higher perfusion-related complications, and increased cost relative to muscle-sparing free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flaps. The authors performed the first cost-utility analysis examining the cost effectiveness of DIEP flaps relative to muscle-sparing free TRAM flaps in women who underwent mastectomy. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using the MED- LINE, Embase, and Cochrane library databases to include studies directly comparing DIEP to muscle-sparing free TRAM flaps in matched patient cohorts. Eight studies were included, examining 740 DIEP flaps and 807 muscle-sparing free TRAM flaps. Costs were derived adopting both societal and third-party payer perspectives. Utilities were derived from a previous cost-utility analysis. Probabilities of clinically relevant complications were combined with cost and utility estimates to fit into a decision tree analysis. RESULTS: The overall complication rates were 24.7 percent and 21.8 percent for DIEP and muscle-sparing free TRAM flaps, respectively. The authors' baseline analysis using Medicare reimbursement revealed a cost decrease of $69.42 and a clinical benefit of 0.0035 quality-adjusted life-year when performing DIEP flap surgery relative to muscle-sparing free TRAM flap surgery, yielding an incremental cost-utility ratio of -$19,834.29. When using societal costs, the incremental cost-utility ratio increased to $87,800.

14412,Outcome and economic implications of proteomic test-guided second- or third-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: extended analysis of the PROSE trial,"OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer accounts for a significant number of new cancer cases and deaths, with the majority of patients presenting with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitors are recommended as an alternative to chemotherapy for certain patients, challenges exist for clinical utilization. The objective of this analysis was to assess the outcome and economic implications of a clinically validated serum-based proteomic test to guide treatment decisions in patients with advanced NSCLC, who are EGFR-negative or status unknown, and have progressed following at least one chemotherapy regimen. METHODS: This analysis was conducted from a US payer perspective. Clinical outcomes were evaluated over the lifetime of a patient, based on data from randomized trials and clinical studies. The clinical endpoints included treatment utilization, adverse events, survival, and a composite measure of length and quality of life, referred to as the quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs for testing, treatment, surveillance, and management of adverse events were analyzed based on publicly available costs of the related procedures. The economic endpoints were cumulative lifetime direct medical costs and cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: In the base case, treatment recommendation for 27.3% of the patient population changed from erlotinib to chemotherapy after using the proteomic test. Overall survival increased by 0.091 year and QALYs increased by 0.050 year. The total lifetime direct medical cost per patient decreased by $135 with test-guided treatment. The findings were robust over a wide range of variation in the input parameters. CONCLUSION: The serum-based proteomic test informed treatment selection for patients with advanced NSCLC who failed previous chemotherapy regimen(s), improving QALYs and saving costs.",2015-01-18450,25804732,Lung Cancer,John Hornberger,2015,88 / 2,223-30,No,25804732,"John Hornberger; Fred R Hirsch; Qianyi Li; Ray D Page; Outcome and economic implications of proteomic test-guided second- or third-line treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: extended analysis of the PROSE trial, Lung Cancer, 2015 May; 88(2):0169-5002; 223-30",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with proteomic test vs. Treatment without proteomic test,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"3 Years, Lifetime",3.00,3.00,-2700,United States,2014,-2951.77
14413,Cost-effectiveness analysis of endoscopic ultrasound versus magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography in patients with suspected common bile duct stones,"BACKGROUND: Patients with suspected common bile duct (CBD) stones are often diagnosed using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), an invasive procedure with risk of significant complications. Using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or Magnetic Resonance CholangioPancreatography (MRCP) first to detect CBD stones can reduce the risk of unnecessary procedures, cut complications and may save costs. AIM: This study sought to compare the cost-effectiveness of initial EUS or MRCP in patients with suspected CBD stones. METHODS: This study is a model based cost-utility analysis estimating mean costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS) over a 1 year time horizon. A decision tree model was constructed and populated with probabilities, outcomes and cost data from published sources, including one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Using MRCP to select patients for ERCP was less costly than using EUS to select patients or proceeding directly to ERCP ($1299 versus $1753 and $1781, respectively), with similar QALYs accruing to each option (0.998, 0.998 and 0.997 for EUS, MRCP and direct ERCP, respectively). Initial MRCP was the most cost-effective option with the highest monetary net benefit, and this result was not sensitive to model parameters. MRCP had a 61% probability of being cost-effective at $29,000, the maximum willingness to pay for a QALY commonly used in the UK.

14415,Cost effectiveness of 'on demand' HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis for non-injection drug-using men who have sex with men in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Recent trials report the efficacy of continuous tenofovir-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for prevention of HIV infection. The cost effectiveness of 'on demand' PrEP for non-injection drug-using men who have sex with men at high risk of HIV acquisition has not been evaluated. OBJECTIVE: To conduct an economic evaluation of the societal costs of HIV in Canada and evaluate the potential benefits of this PrEP strategy. METHODS: Direct HIV costs comprised outpatient, inpatient and emergency department costs, psychosocial costs and antiretroviral costs. Resource consumption estimates were derived from the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal HIV cohort. Estimates of indirect costs included employment rate and work absenteeism. Costs for 'on demand' PrEP were modelled after an ongoing clinical trial. Cost-effectiveness analysis compared costs of 'on demand' PrEP to prevent one infection with lifetime costs of one HIV infection. Benefits were presented in terms of life-years and quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS: The average annual direct cost of one HIV infection was $16,109 in the least expensive antiretroviral regimen scenario and $24,056 in the most expensive scenario. The total indirect cost was $11,550 per year. Total costs for the first year of HIV infection ranged from $27,410 to $35,358. Undiscounted lifetime costs ranged from $1,439,984 ($662,295 discounted at 3% and $448,901 at 5%) to $1,482,502 ($690,075 at 3% and $485,806 at 5%). The annual cost of PrEP was $12,001 per participant, and $621,390 per infection prevented. The PrEP strategy was cost-saving in all scenarios for undiscounted and 3% discounting rates. At 5% discounting rates, the strategy is largely cost-effective: according to least and most expensive scenarios, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $60,311 to $47,407 per quality-adjusted life-year. CONCLUSION: This 'on demand' PrEP strategy ranges from cost-saving to largely cost-effective.

14416,Cost-utility analysis of tocilizumab monotherapy in first line versus standard of care for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Greece,"The study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding tocilizumab (TCZ) first line to a treatment sequence for patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA), who had an inadequate response to one or more traditional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and are intolerant to methotrexate (MTX), or in whom continued treatment with MTX is considered inappropriate. An individual simulation model was applied to project lifetime costs and outcomes for 10,000 patients from a payer's perspective. The analysis compared the standard treatment pathway (STP) with a similar pathway, where treatment was initiated with TCZ. QALYs were used as primary efficacy outcomes. Efficacy data were obtained from the ADACTA trial and a network meta-analysis. Clinical practice standards were derived from an expert panel of Greek rheumatologists. Results indicate that a treatment sequence starting with TCZ yields 1.17 more QALYs (9.38 vs. 8.21) at an additional cost of <euro>33,744 (<euro>119,840 vs. <euro>86,096) compared with the STP. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was <euro>28,837/QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis confirms robustness of these findings as consistently below a threshold of <euro>45,000. The results of the analysis suggest that TCZ, when used as a first-line biologic monotherapy, can be a cost-effective treatment option for the management of active RA in patients in need of biologic monotherapy.",2015-01-18465,25794569,Rheumatol Int,Kostas Athanasakis,2015,35 / 9,1489-95,No,25794569,"Kostas Athanasakis; Filippos Tarantilis; Konstantina Tsalapati; Thomais Konstantopoulou; Eleni Vritzali; John Kyriopoulos; Cost-utility analysis of tocilizumab monotherapy in first line versus standard of care for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Greece, Rheumatol Int, 2015 Sep; 35(9):0172-8172; 1489-95",QALY,Greece,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment pathway initiated with tocilizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,28837,Euro,2013,42550.11
14417,Comparative effectiveness of screening strategies for Lynch syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Approximately 3% of colorectal cancers are associated with Lynch Syndrome. Controversy exists regarding the optimal screening strategy for Lynch Syndrome. METHODS: Using an individual level microsimulation of a population affected by Lynch syndrome over several years, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 21 screening strategies were compared. Modeling assumptions were based upon published literature, and sensitivity analyses were performed for key assumptions. In a two-step process, the number of Lynch syndrome diagnoses (Step 1) and life-years gained as a result of foreknowledge of Lynch syndrome in otherwise healthy carriers (Step 2) were measured. RESULTS: The optimal strategy was sequential screening for probands starting with a predictive model, then immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair protein expression (IHC), followed by germline mutation testing (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] of $35 143 per life-year gained). The strategies of IHC + BRAF, germline testing and universal germline testing of colon cancer probands had ICERs of $144 117 and $996 878, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that the initial step in screening for Lynch Syndrome should be the use of predictive models in probands.

14437,Cost-effectiveness of adding bedaquiline to drug regimens for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding bedaquiline to a background regimen (BR) of drugs for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of bedaquiline plus BR (BBR) versus BR alone (BR) in the treatment of MDR-TB, over a 10-year time horizon. A National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services perspective was considered. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Data were sourced from a phase II, placebo-controlled trial, NHS reference costs, and the literature; the US list price of bedaquiline was used and converted to pounds ( pound18,800). Costs and effectiveness were discounted at a rate of 3.5% per annum. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The total discounted cost per patient (pp) on BBR was pound106,487, compared with pound117,922 for BR. The total discounted QALYs pp were 5.16 for BBR and 4.01 for BR. The addition of bedaquiline to a BR resulted in a cost-saving of pound11,434 and an additional 1.14 QALYs pp over a 10-year period, and is therefore considered to be the dominant (less costly and more effective) strategy over BR. BBR remained dominant in the majority of sensitivity analyses, with a 81% probability of being dominant versus BR in the probabilistic analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In the UK, bedaquiline is likely to be cost-effective and cost-saving, compared with the current MDR-TB standard of care under a range of scenarios. Cost-savings over a 10-year period were realized from reductions in length of hospitalization, which offset the bedaquiline drug costs. The cost-benefit conclusions held after several sensitivity analyses, thus validating assumptions made, and suggesting that the results would hold even if the actual price of bedaquiline in the UK were higher than in the US.",2015-01-18467,25794045,PLoS One,Lara J Wolfson,2015,10 / 3,e0120763,No,25794045,"Lara J Wolfson; Anna Walker; Robert Hettle; Xiaoyan Lu; Chrispin Kambili; Andrew Murungi; Gerhart Knerer; Cost-effectiveness of adding bedaquiline to drug regimens for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in the UK, PLoS One , 2015; 10(3):1932-6203; e0120763",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bedaquiline + background regimen vs. Background regimen,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"10 Years, 2 years",3.50,3.50,-9943.48,United Kingdom,2013,-17279.41
14438,Economic evaluation for the UK of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in the treatment of metastatic pancreas cancer,"BACKGROUND: The combination of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine (NAB-P+GEM) has shown superior efficacy over GEM monotherapy in metastatic pancreas cancer (MPC). Independent cost-effectiveness/utility analyses of NAB-P+GEM from the payer perspective have not been conducted for the UK. METHODS: A Markov model simulating the health outcomes and total costs was developed to estimate the life years gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years gained (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) and cost-utility ratios (ICUR) for patients with MPC in a base case and in a probabilistic (PSA) sensitivity analysis. Total cost included the cost of supportive care medications, administration, chemotherapy, disease monitoring, and adverse reactions; and was discounted at 3.5% per year.

14439,Cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin vs switching to rosuvastatin therapy in Portugal,"BACKGROUND: Statin monotherapy is the mainstay of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) management for high cardiovascular risk patients in Portugal; however, several therapeutic options are available and predicted to have different clinical and economic impacts. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe 10 mg (EZ10) to atorvastatin 10 or 20 mg (A10/20) vs switching to rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg (R10/20) in Portuguese patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and/or diabetes who are currently above the LDL-C goal. METHODS: A Markov model was used to describe CHD disease progression and the lifetime costs and utilities associated with each disease state were used to estimate the gains in life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), as well as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), of the two treatment regimens. Model inputs, such as age, gender, and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors of the dyslipidemic Portuguese patients were obtained from the Portuguese cohort of the Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS). The efficacy of each treatment regimen, the cost of drugs and of treating CHD events, and the utilities for each disease state were derived from published sources. RESULTS: The estimated lifetime discounted number of QALYs gained by patients treated with A10/20 was 8.70, while in those switching to R10/20 it was 8.81 and in those adding EZ10 it was 8.93. Discounted total health costs were estimated to be euro11,131 for A10/20, but euro14,511 and euro16,571 for R10/20 and A10/20 + EZ10, respectively. The ICER of adding ezetimibe vs switching to rosuvastatin was euro16,465/QALY. Based on the Portuguese cost-effectiveness willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000/QALY, adding ezetimibe vs switching to rosuvastatin would be a cost-effective use of resources in Portugal. Sensitivity analyses in patients with differing clinical histories (CHD or diabetes or both) yielded similar values, with no ICER over euro30,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: From the perspective of the National Health Service, prescribing ezetimibe to high cardiovascular risk patients being treated with atorvastatin vs switching them to rosuvastatin is projected to be a cost-effective use of resources in Portugal.",2015-01-18474,25788039,Eur J Public Health,Pedro A Laires,2015,/,1-8,No,25788039,"Pedro A Laires; Flavia Ejzykowicz; Tun-Ying Hsu; Baishali Ambegaonkar; Glenn Davies; Cost-effectiveness of adding ezetimibe to atorvastatin vs switching to rosuvastatin therapy in Portugal, Eur J Public Health, 2015 Sep 21; ():1464-360X; 1-8",QALY,Portugal,Not Stated,Not Stated,Atorvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg + Ezetimibe 10 mg vs. Rosuvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,16465,Euro,2013,24294.75

14443,Cost-effectiveness of coronary artery calcium testing for coronary heart and cardiovascular disease risk prediction to guide statin allocation: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA),"BACKGROUND: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) showed that the addition of coronary artery calcium (CAC) to traditional risk factors improves risk classification, particularly in intermediate risk asymptomatic patients with LDL cholesterol levels <160 mg/dL. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating CAC into treatment decision rules has yet to be clearly delineated. OBJECTIVE: To model the cost-effectiveness of CAC for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic, intermediate risk patients not taking a statin. Treatment based on CAC was compared to (1) treatment of all intermediate-risk patients, and (2) treatment on the basis of United States guidelines. METHODS: We developed a Markov model of first coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We modeled statin treatment in intermediate risk patients with CAC>/=1 and CAC>/=100, with different intensities of statins based on the CAC score. We compared these CAC-based treatment strategies to a ""treat all"" strategy and to treatment according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines. Clinical and economic outcomes were modeled over both five- and ten-year time horizons. Outcomes consisted of CHD and CVD events and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses considered the effect of higher event rates, different CAC and statin costs, indirect costs, and re-scanning patients with incidentalomas. RESULTS: We project that it is both cost-saving and more effective to scan intermediate-risk patients for CAC and to treat those with CAC>/=1, compared to treatment based on established risk-assessment guidelines. Treating patients with CAC>/=100 is also preferred to existing guidelines when we account for statin side effects and the disutility of statin use.

Treating patients with CAC>/=100 is also preferred to existing guidelines when we account for statin side effects and the disutility of statin use.

14450,Cost-effectiveness of coronary artery calcium testing for coronary heart and cardiovascular disease risk prediction to guide statin allocation: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA),"BACKGROUND: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) showed that the addition of coronary artery calcium (CAC) to traditional risk factors improves risk classification, particularly in intermediate risk asymptomatic patients with LDL cholesterol levels <160 mg/dL. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating CAC into treatment decision rules has yet to be clearly delineated. OBJECTIVE: To model the cost-effectiveness of CAC for cardiovascular risk stratification in asymptomatic, intermediate risk patients not taking a statin. Treatment based on CAC was compared to (1) treatment of all intermediate-risk patients, and (2) treatment on the basis of United States guidelines. METHODS: We developed a Markov model of first coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. We modeled statin treatment in intermediate risk patients with CAC>/=1 and CAC>/=100, with different intensities of statins based on the CAC score. We compared these CAC-based treatment strategies to a ""treat all"" strategy and to treatment according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines. Clinical and economic outcomes were modeled over both five- and ten-year time horizons. Outcomes consisted of CHD and CVD events and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses considered the effect of higher event rates, different CAC and statin costs, indirect costs, and re-scanning patients with incidentalomas. RESULTS: We project that it is both cost-saving and more effective to scan intermediate-risk patients for CAC and to treat those with CAC>/=1, compared to treatment based on established risk-assessment guidelines.

14451,Cost-effectiveness analysis of fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection,"OBJECTIVE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) places a high burden on the US healthcare system. Recurrent CDI (RCDI) occurs frequently. Recently proposed guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) and the American Gastroenterology Association (AGA) include fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) as a therapeutic option for RCDI. The purpose of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of FMT compared with vancomycin for the treatment of RCDI in adults, specifically following guidelines proposed by the ACG and AGA. DESIGN: We constructed a decision-analytic computer simulation using inputs from the published literature to compare the standard approach using tapered vancomycin to FMT for RCDI from the third-party payer perspective. Our effectiveness measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Because simulated patients were followed for 90 days, discounting was not necessary. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Base-case analysis showed that FMT was less costly ($1,669 vs $3,788) and more effective (0.242 QALYs vs 0.235 QALYs) than vancomycin for RCDI. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that FMT was the dominant strategy (both less expensive and more effective) if cure rates for FMT and vancomycin were >/=70% and <91%, respectively, and if the cost of FMT was <$3,206. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis, varying all parameters simultaneously, showed that FMT was the dominant strategy over 10, 000 second-order Monte Carlo simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that FMT may be a cost-saving intervention in managing RCDI. Implementation of FMT for RCDI may help decrease the economic burden to the healthcare system.",2015-01-18490,25782899,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Raghu U Varier,2015,36 / 4,438-44,No,25782899,"Raghu U Varier; Eman Biltaji; Kenneth J Smith; Mark S Roberts; M Kyle Jensen; Joanne Lafleur; Richard E Nelson; Cost-effectiveness analysis of fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol, 2015 Apr; 36(4):0899-823X; 438-44",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Fecal microbiota transplantation, administered via colonoscopy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Vancomycin, 250 mg every 6 hours for 2 weeks followed by a 6-week oral vancomycin taper",Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,13 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-302714.28,United States,2011,-348297.92

DESIGN: Using an intestinal-type NCGA microsimulation model, we evaluated the following one-time screening strategies for US men: (1) serum pepsinogen to detect gastric atrophy (with endoscopic follow-up of positive screen results), (2) endoscopic screening to detect dysplasia and asymptomatic cancer (with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) treatment for detected lesions) and (3) Helicobacter pylori screening and treatment. Screening performance, treatment effectiveness, cancer and cost data were based on published literature and databases. Subgroups included current, former and never smokers.

TARGET POPULATION: Treatment-naive patients infected with chronic HCV genotype 1, 2, or 3. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Usual care (boceprevir-ribavirin-pegylated interferon [PEG]) was compared with sofosbuvir-ribavirin-PEG and 3 PEG-free regimens: sofosbuvir-simeprevir, sofosbuvir-daclatasvir, and sofosbuvir-ledipasvir. For genotypes 2 and 3, usual care (ribavirin-PEG) was compared with sofosbuvir-ribavirin, sofosbuvir-daclatasvir, and sofosbuvir-ledipasvir-ribavirin (genotype 3 only). OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted costs (in 2014 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Assuming sofosbuvir, simeprevir, daclatasvir, and ledipasvir cost $7000, $5500, $5500, and $875 per week, respectively, sofosbuvir-ledipasvir was cost-effective for genotype 1 and cost $12 825 more per QALY than usual care. For genotype 2, sofosbuvir-ribavirin and sofosbuvir-daclatasvir cost $110 000 and $691 000 per QALY, respectively. For genotype 3, sofosbuvir-ledipasvir-ribavirin cost $73 000 per QALY, sofosbuvir-ribavirin was more costly and less effective than usual care, and sofosbuvir-daclatasvir cost more than $396 000 per QALY at assumed prices. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Sofosbuvir-ledipasvir was the optimal strategy in most simulations for genotype 1 and would be cost-saving if sofosbuvir cost less than $5500. For genotype 2, sofosbuvir-ribavirin-PEG would be cost-saving if sofosbuvir cost less than $2250 per week. For genotype 3, sofosbuvir-ledipasvir-ribavirin would be cost-saving if sofosbuvir cost less than $1500 per week. LIMITATION: Data are lacking on real-world effectiveness of new treatments and some prices.

RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Assuming sofosbuvir, simeprevir, daclatasvir, and ledipasvir cost $7000, $5500, $5500, and $875 per week, respectively, sofosbuvir-ledipasvir was cost-effective for genotype 1 and cost $12 825 more per QALY than usual care. For genotype 2, sofosbuvir-ribavirin and sofosbuvir-daclatasvir cost $110 000 and $691 000 per QALY, respectively. For genotype 3, sofosbuvir-ledipasvir-ribavirin cost $73 000 per QALY, sofosbuvir-ribavirin was more costly and less effective than usual care, and sofosbuvir-daclatasvir cost more than $396 000 per QALY at assumed prices. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Sofosbuvir-ledipasvir was the optimal strategy in most simulations for genotype 1 and would be cost-saving if sofosbuvir cost less than $5500. For genotype 2, sofosbuvir-ribavirin-PEG would be cost-saving if sofosbuvir cost less than $2250 per week.

14468,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact of hepatitis C virus treatment with sofosbuvir and ledipasvir in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir, which have recently been approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, are more efficacious and safer than the old standard of care (oSOC) but are substantially more expensive. Whether and in which patients their improved efficacy justifies their increased cost is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir. DESIGN: Microsimulation model of the natural history of HCV infection. DATA SOURCES: Published literature. TARGET POPULATION: Treatment-naive and treatment-experienced HCV population defined on the basis of HCV genotype, age, and fibrosis distribution in the United States. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Third-party payer. INTERVENTION: Simulation of sofosbuvir-ledipasvir compared with the oSOC (interferon-based therapies). OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and 5-year spending on antiviral drugs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Sofosbuvir-based therapies added 0.56 QALY relative to the oSOC at an ICER of $55 400 per additional QALY. The ICERs ranged from $9700 to $284 300 per QALY depending on the patient's status with respect to treatment history, HCV genotype, and presence of cirrhosis. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY, sofosbuvir-based therapies were cost-effective in 83% of treatment-naive and 81% of treatment-experienced patients. Compared with the oSOC, treating eligible HCV-infected persons in the United States with the new drugs would cost an additional $65 billion in the next 5 years, whereas the resulting cost offsets would be $16 billion.

The ICERs ranged from $9700 to $284 300 per QALY depending on the patient's status with respect to treatment history, HCV genotype, and presence of cirrhosis. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY, sofosbuvir-based therapies were cost-effective in 83% of treatment-naive and 81% of treatment-experienced patients. Compared with the oSOC, treating eligible HCV-infected persons in the United States with the new drugs would cost an additional $65 billion in the next 5 years, whereas the resulting cost offsets would be $16 billion. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were sensitive to drug price, drug efficacy, and quality of life after successful treatment. LIMITATION: Data on real-world effectiveness of new antivirals are lacking. CONCLUSION: Treatment of HCV is cost-effective in most patients, but additional resources and value-based patient prioritization are needed to manage patients with HCV.

14491,Comparing the cost-effectiveness of rituximab maintenance and radioimmunotherapy consolidation versus observation following first-line therapy in patients with follicular lymphoma,"BACKGROUND: Phase 3 randomized trials have shown that maintenance rituximab (MR) therapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT) consolidation following frontline therapy can improve progression-free survival for patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), but the cost-effectiveness of these approaches with respect to observation has not been examined using a common modeling framework. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate and compare the economic impact of MR and RIT consolidation versus observation, respectively, following the first-line induction therapy for patients with advanced-stage FL. METHODS: We developed Markov models to estimate patients' lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and life-years (LYs) after MR, RIT, and observation following frontline FL treatment from the US payer's perspective. Progression risks, adverse event probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from clinical data of Primary RItuximab and MAintenance (PRIMA) trial, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial (for MR), and First-line Indolent Trial (for RIT) and the published literature. We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for direct comparisons between MR/RIT and observation. Model robustness was addressed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with observation, MR provided an additional 1.089 QALYs (1.099 LYs) and 1.399 QALYs (1.391 LYs) on the basis of the PRIMA trial and the ECOG trial, respectively, and RIT provided an additional 1.026 QALYs (1.034 LYs). The incremental cost per QALY gained was $40,335 (PRIMA) or $37,412 (ECOG) for MR and $40,851 for RIT. MR and RIT had comparable incremental QALYs before first progression, whereas RIT had higher incremental costs of adverse events due to higher incidences of cytopenias.

METHODS: We compared TCZ Mono (8 mg/kg monthly) with ADA Mono (40 mg every other week), using efficacy results from a head-to-head study, ADalimumab ACTemrA (ADACTA). We calculated the incremental cost per responder (achievement of American College of Rheumatology [ACR] 20% improvement criteria, ACR 50% improvement criteria, ACR 70% improvement criteria, or low disease activity score) for TCZ versus ADA at 6 months. A patient-level simulation was used to estimate the lifetime incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of initiating treatment with TCZ Mono versus ADA Mono. Both drugs are followed by an etanercept-certolizumab-palliative care sequence. Nonresponders discontinue at 6 months; responders experience a constant probability of discontinuation. Discontinuers move to the next treatment. ACR responses produce changes in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score. We mapped the HAQ score to utility to estimate QALYs. Costs include those related to hospitalization and those related to treatment (drug acquisition, administration, and monitoring). Probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted, along with several scenario analyses. RESULTS: Compared with ADA, TCZ was more effective, with an estimated 6-month incremental cost ranging from $6,570 per additional low disease activity score achiever to $14,265 per additional ACR 70% improvement criteria responder.

14496,An economic analysis of adherence engineering to improve use of best practices during central line maintenance procedures,"OBJECTIVE: Adherence engineering applies human factors principles to examine non-adherence within a specific task and to guide the development of materials or equipment to increase protocol adherence and reduce human error. Central line maintenance (CLM) for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is a task through which error or non-adherence to protocols can cause central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). We conducted an economic analysis of an adherence engineering CLM kit designed to improve the CLM task and reduce the risk of CLABSI. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of the CLM kit, which contains each of the 27 items necessary for performing the CLM procedure, compared with the standard care procedure for CLM, in which each item for dressing maintenance is gathered separately. We estimated the model using the cost of CLABSI overall ($45,685) as well as the excess LOS (6.9 excess ICU days, 3.5 excess general ward days). RESULTS: Assuming the CLM kit reduces the risk of CLABSI by 100% and 50%, this strategy was less costly (cost savings between $306 and $860) and more effective (between 0.05 and 0.13 more quality-adjusted life-years) compared with not using the pre-packaged kit. We identified threshold values for the effectiveness of the kit in reducing CLABSI for which the kit strategy was no longer less costly. CONCLUSION: An adherence engineering-based intervention to streamline the CLM process can improve patient outcomes and lower costs. Patient safety can be improved by adopting new approaches that are based on human factors principles.",2015-01-18520,25772996,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Richard E Nelson,2015,36 / 5,550-6,No,25772996,"Richard E Nelson; Aaron W Angelovic; Scott D Nelson; Jeremy R Gleed; Frank A Drews; An economic analysis of adherence engineering to improve use of best practices during central line maintenance procedures, Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol, 2015 May; 36(5):0899-823X; 550-6",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Central line maintenance kit vs. None,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.00,-6615.38,United States,2013,-7349.57
14497,An economic model assessing the value of microneedle patch delivery of the seasonal influenza vaccine,"BACKGROUND: New vaccine technologies may improve the acceptability, delivery (potentially enabling self-administration), and product efficacy of influenza vaccines. One such technology is the microneedle patch (MNP), a skin delivery technology currently in development. Although MNPs hold promise in preclinical studies, their potential economic and epidemiologic impacts have not yet been evaluated. METHODS: We utilized a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) transmission model linked to an economic influenza outcomes model to assess the economic value of introducing the MNP into the current influenza vaccine market in the United States from the third-party payer and societal perspectives. We also explored the impact of different vaccination settings, self-administration, the MNP price, vaccine efficacy, compliance, and MNP market share. Outcomes included costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cases, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs; cost/QALY). RESULTS: With healthcare provider administration, MNP introduction would be cost-effective (ICERs </=$23,347/QALY) at all MNP price points ($9.50-$30) and market shares (10-60%) assessed, except when compliance and efficacy were assumed to be the same as existing vaccines and the MNP occupied a 10% market share. If MNP self-administration were available (assuming the same efficacy as current technologies), MNP compliance or its efficacy would need to increase by >/=3% in order to be cost-effective (ICERs </=$1401/QALY), assuming a 2% reduction in administration success with unsupervised self-administration. Under these conditions, MNP introduction would be cost-effective for all price points and market shares assessed. CONCLUSIONS: When healthcare providers administered the MNP, its introduction would be cost-effective or dominant (i.e., less costly and more effective) in the majority of scenarios assessed. If self-administration were available, MNP introduction would be cost-effective if it increased compliance enough to overcome any decrease in self-administration success or if the MNP presentation afforded an increase in efficacy over current delivery methods for influenza vaccines.",2015-01-18521,25772675,Vaccine,Bruce Y Lee,2015,33 / 37,4727-36,Yes,25772675,"Bruce Y Lee; Sarah M Bartsch; Mercy Mvundura; Courtney Jarrahian; Kristina M Zapf; Kathleen Marinan; Angela R Wateska; Bill Snyder; Savitha Swaminathan; Erica Jacoby; James J Norman; Mark R Prausnitz; Darin Zehrung; An economic model assessing the value of microneedle patch delivery of the seasonal influenza vaccine, Vaccine, 2015 Sep 8; 33(37):1873-2518; 4727-36",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Microneedle patch delivery of the seasonal influenza vaccine vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,182,United States,2013,202.2
14498,Cost-effectiveness of Sativex in multiple sclerosis spasticity: new data and application to Italy,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic progressive disease that carries a high socioeconomic burden. Spasticity (rigidity and spasms) is common in MS and contributes to MS-related disability. This study aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Sativex((R)) (9-delta-tetrahydrocannabinol plus cannabidiol oromucosal spray) when used as add-on therapy for management of resistant MS-related spasticity in the context of the Italian healthcare system. A previously published Markov model-based analysis for the German and Spanish context was replicated, adapting it to the Italian setting. Model parameters were updated to reflect recent findings about MS-related spasticity and use of Sativex in daily clinical practice. The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for Sativex use in Italy over a 5-year period was estimated to be euro4968 per quality-adjusted life-year gained (year of costing: 2013). Sativex remained an efficient option in the Italian healthcare context - below the commonly accepted incremental threshold of euro30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained - when deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted.

14499,Platelet-Rich Plasma Reduces Retear Rates After Arthroscopic Repair of Small- and Medium-Sized Rotator Cuff Tears but Is Not Cost-Effective,"BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that platelet-rich plasma (PRP) improves healing after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. The current literature provides ample but inconsistent data on this topic. PURPOSE: To systematically review the current in vivo evidence for the use of platelet concentrates (PRP) in the arthroscopic treatment of rotator cuff tears to assess effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness. STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: Published evidence from controlled, human trials of rotator cuff repair augmented with platelet concentrates was systematically gathered, and data on retear rates were extracted. Mathematical and clinical heterogeneity was evaluated, and fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate the risk ratio (RR) of retears and the number needed to treat (NNT). Subgroup analyses were made for small/medium tears (n = 404) and large/massive tears (n = 374). Cost-effectiveness was assessed using data from this meta-analysis and using cost data from the literature, including extensive sensitivity analyses, to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Thirteen studies published between 2010 and 2014 were identified for analysis. The RR for retear for all patients was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.67-1.12; P = .286). For small- and medium-sized tears (<3 cm), the RR for retear was 0.60 (95% CI, 0.37-0.97), consistent with a significant difference in favor of PRP use (P = .038). This translated into an NNT of 14 (95% CI, 7-125). However, at an ICER of US$127,893 per quality-adjusted life year gained, assuming a 5% revision rate, the use of PRP was not cost-effective for small- and medium-sized tears. CONCLUSION: In large tears, even with double-row repair, the beneficial effects of PRP alone are insufficient to compensate the progressed tissue damage. The study data suggest that PRP may promote healing of small- and medium-sized tears to reduce retear rates. However, despite the substantial biological effect, at current cost, the use of PRP is not cost-effective in arthroscopic repair of small- and medium-sized tears.",2015-01-18532,25767267,Am J Sports Med,Patrick Vavken,2015,/,,No,25767267,"Patrick Vavken; Patrick Sadoghi; Matthew Palmer; Claudio Rosso; Andreas M Mueller; Gregor Szoelloesy; Victor Valderrabano; Platelet-Rich Plasma Reduces Retear Rates After Arthroscopic Repair of Small- and Medium-Sized Rotator Cuff Tears but Is Not Cost-Effective, Am J Sports Med, 2015 Apr 30; ():1552-3365",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Platelet concentrates (platelet-rich plasma, PRP) vs. None",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,141355.92,United States,2013,157043.86
14500,A Markov model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of antiangiogenesis therapy using bevacizumab in advanced cervical cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab in recurrent/persistent and metastatic cervical cancer using recently reported updated survival and toxicology data. METHODS: A Markov decision tree based on the Gynecologic Oncology Group 240 randomized trial was created. The 2013 MediCare Services Drug Payment Table and Physician Fee Schedule provided costs. In the 5-year model subjects transitioned through the following states: response, progression, minor complications, severe complications, and death. Patients experiencing a health utility per month according to treatment effectiveness were calculated. Because cervical cancer survival is measured in months rather than years, results were reported in both quality adjusted cervical cancer life months and years (QALmonth, QALY), adjusted from a baseline of having advanced cervical cancer during a month. RESULTS: The estimated total cost of therapy with bevacizumab is approximately 13.2 times that for chemotherapy alone, adding $73,791 per 3.5months (0.29year) of life gained, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $21.083 per month of added life. The ICER increased to $5775 per month of added life and $24,597/QALmonth ($295,164/QALY) due to the smaller difference in QALmonths. With 75% bevacizumab cost reduction, the ICER is $6737/QALmonth ($80,844/QALY), which translates to $23,580 for the 3.5month (0.29year) gain in OS. CONCLUSIONS: Increased costs are primarily related to the cost of drug and not the management of bevacizumab-induced complications. Cost reductions in bevacizumab result in dramatic declines in the ICER, suggesting that cost reconciliation in advanced cervical cancer may be possible through the availability of biosimilars, and/or less expensive, equally efficacious anti-angiogenesis agents.",2015-01-18538,25766118,Gynecol Oncol,Lindsey E Minion,2015,137 / 3,490-6,No,25766118,"Lindsey E Minion; Jiaru Bai; Bradley J Monk; L Robin Keller; Eskander N Ramez; Gareth K Forde; John K Chan; Krishnansu S Tewari; A Markov model to evaluate cost-effectiveness of antiangiogenesis therapy using bevacizumab in advanced cervical cancer, Gynecol Oncol, 2015 Jun; 137(3):0090-8258; 490-6",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Antiangiogenesis therapy with bevacizumab vs. Standard/Usual Care- Chemotherapy alone (cisplatin + paclitaxel),"Untreated, recurrent/persistent and metastatic cervical cancer",Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,252996,United States,2013,281073.97
