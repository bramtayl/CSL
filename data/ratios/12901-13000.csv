12901,Exploring the Potential Cost-Effectiveness of Patient Decision Aids for Use in Adults with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Case Study,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence highlighting the effectiveness of patient decision aids (PtDAs), but evidence supporting their cost-effectiveness is lacking. We consider patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in whom a PtDA may decrease nonadherence to treatment by empowering patients to receive the option that is most congruent with their own values. OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential costs and benefits of delivering a PtDA to patients with moderate OSA. METHODS: A Markov cohort decision-analytic model was developed for patients with moderate OSA, comparing a PtDA to usual care over 5 years from a societal perspective. Data for patient preference for treatment options was taken from a recent randomized crossover trial, event data (cardiovascular, motor vehicle accidents) came from national databases and published literature. Potential improvements in adherence are unknown, so we considered a realistic range of values. Outcome measures were 5-year costs (in 2010 Canadian dollars), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: When adherence to treatment was unchanged, the PtDA strategy was dominated by incurring lower QALYs and higher costs. When nonadherence was decreased by 20% in the PtDA arm (corresponding to an increase in adherence from 63% to 70% for continuous positive airway pressure and from 77% to 82% for mandibular advancement splints in year 1), the ICER fell to $62,414/QALY. Costs associated with the treatment devices and delivering the PtDA had the greatest effect on cost-effectiveness. LIMITATIONS: The model relies on surrogate measures and opinions for key parameters. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of PtDAs will depend on contextual factors, but a framework is described for properly considering their long-term cost-effectiveness. A number of important questions around the appropriateness of benefit measurement for PtDA trials are highlighted.",2014-01-15722,25344130,Med Decis Making,Logan Trenaman,2015,35 / 5,,No,25344130,"Logan Trenaman; Mohsen Sadatsafavi; Fernanda Almeida; Najib Ayas; Larry Lynd; Carlo Marra; Dawn Stacey; Nick Bansback; Exploring the Potential Cost-Effectiveness of Patient Decision Aids for Use in Adults with Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Case Study, Med Decis Making, 2015 Jul; 35(5):0272-989X",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Patient decision aids after diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea but prior to a consultation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,62414,Canada,2010,71960.48
12902,Refitting of the UKPDS 68 risk equations to contemporary routine clinical practice data in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: Economic evaluations of new diabetes therapies rely heavily upon the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) equations for prediction of cardiovascular events; however, concerns persist regarding their relevance to current clinical practice and appropriate use in populations other than newly diagnosed patients. This study refits the UKPDS 68 event equations, using contemporary data describing low- and intermediate-risk patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Anonymized patient data describing demographics, risk factors and incidence of cardiovascular and microvascular events were extracted from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database over the 10-year period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2009. Following multiple imputation of missing values, accelerated failure-time Weibull regression equations were refitted to produce new coefficients for each risk group. Discriminatory performance was assessed and compared with both UKPDS 68 and UKPDS 82 risk equations, and the implication of coefficient choice within an economic evaluation was assessed using the Cardiff type 2 diabetes model. RESULTS: When applied to patient-level data, the three sets of coefficients (UKPDS, THIN low-risk and intermediate-risk) lead to fairly consistent predictions of the 5-year risk of events. Exceptions include lower predicted rates of myocardial infarction and higher rates of ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure and end-stage renal disease with both sets of revised THIN coefficients compared with UKPDS. Over a modelled lifetime, the coefficients derived from the low-risk data predict fewer total cardiovascular events compared with UKPDS, while those from the intermediate-risk data predict a greater number. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves demonstrated a marginal improvement in the discriminatory performance of the refitted equations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio associated with dapagliflozin versus sulphonylurea in addition to metformin changed from pound7,708 to pound7,519 and pound6,906 per QALY gained, using the THIN intermediate- and low-risk coefficients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that while the UKPDS equations perform best in newly diagnosed patients, they may overpredict the lifetime risk in this group and underpredict it in patients with more advanced diabetes. Implementation of the revised coefficients will result in different absolute numbers of predicted diabetes-related events; however, they are not expected to significantly affect the conclusions of economic modelling.",2014-01-15723,25344660,Pharmacoeconomics,P McEwan,2015,33 / 2,,Yes,25344660,"P McEwan; H Bennett; T Ward; K Bergenheim; Refitting of the UKPDS 68 risk equations to contemporary routine clinical practice data in the UK, Pharmacoeconomics, 2015 Feb; 33(2):1179-2027",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dapagliflozin vs. Sulphonylurea in addition to metformin,Not Stated,Not Stated,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.50,3.50,7519,United Kingdom,2012,13436.94

12905,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of neoadjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab therapy for locally advanced, inflammatory, or early HER2-positive breast cancer in Canada","OBJECTIVE: The NeoSphere trial demonstrated that the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel for the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive locally advanced, inflammatory, or early breast cancer (eBC) resulted in a significant improvement in pathological complete response (pCR). Furthermore, the TRYPHAENA trial supported the benefit of neoadjuvant dual anti-HER2 therapy. Survival data from these trials is not yet available; however, other studies have demonstrated a correlation between pCR and improved event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) in this patient population. This study represents the first Canadian cost-effectiveness analysis of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive eBC. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis (CUA) was conducted using a three health state Markov model ('event-free', 'relapsed', and 'dead'). Two separate analyses were conducted; the first considering total pCR (ypT0/is ypN0) data from NeoSphere, and the second from TRYPHAENA. Published EFS and OS data partitioned for patients achieving/not achieving pCR were used in combination with the percentage achieving pCR in the pertuzumab trials to estimate survival. This CUA included published utility values and direct medical costs including drugs, treatment administration, management of adverse events, supportive care, and subsequent therapy. To address uncertainty, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) and alternative scenarios were explored. RESULTS: Both analyses suggested that the addition of pertuzumab resulted in increased life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost per QALY ranged from $25,388 (CAD; NeoSphere analysis) to $46,196 (TRYPHAENA analysis). Sensitivity analyses further support the use of pertuzumab, with cost-effectiveness ratios ranging from $9230-$64,421. At a threshold of $100,000, the addition of pertuzumab was cost-effective in nearly all scenarios (93% NeoSphere; 79% TRYPHAENA). CONCLUSION: Given the improvement in clinical efficacy and a favorable cost per QALY, the addition of pertuzumab in the neoadjuvant setting represents an attractive treatment option for HER2-positive eBC patients.",2014-01-15729,25347449,J Med Econ,C L Attard,2015,18 / 3,1-16,Yes,25347449,"C L Attard; A N Pepper; S T Brown; M F Thompson; P-O Thuresson; S Yunger; S Dent; A H Paterson; G A Wells; Cost-effectiveness analysis of neoadjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab therapy for locally advanced, inflammatory, or early HER2-positive breast cancer in Canada, J Med Econ, 2015 Mar; 18(3):1369-6998; 1-16",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel vs. Trastuzumab and docetaxel",Treatment navie,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,"28 Years, 20, 50 years",5.00,5.00,25388,Canada,2014,25145.13

Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine (CSAI) represents an alternative treatment option for advanced PD with motor fluctuation. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CSAI compared with Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG), Deep-Brain-Stimulation (DBS) and Standard-of-care (SOC). METHODS: A multi-country Markov-Model to simulate the long-term consequences, disease progression (Hoehn & Yahr stages 3-5, percentage of waking-time in the OFF-state), complications, and adverse events was developed. Monte-Carlo simulation accounted for uncertainty. Probabilities were derived from RCT and open-label studies. Costs were estimated from the UK and German healthcare provider's perspective.

12912,Cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous apomorphine in the treatment of Parkinson's disease in the UK and Germany,"BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting approximately 5.2 million people worldwide. Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine (CSAI) represents an alternative treatment option for advanced PD with motor fluctuation. The purpose of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CSAI compared with Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG), Deep-Brain-Stimulation (DBS) and Standard-of-care (SOC). METHODS: A multi-country Markov-Model to simulate the long-term consequences, disease progression (Hoehn & Yahr stages 3-5, percentage of waking-time in the OFF-state), complications, and adverse events was developed. Monte-Carlo simulation accounted for uncertainty. Probabilities were derived from RCT and open-label studies. Costs were estimated from the UK and German healthcare provider's perspective. QALYs, life-years (LYs), and costs were projected over a life-time horizon. RESULTS: UK lifetime costs associated with CSAI amounts to pound78,251.49 and generates 2.85 QALYs and 6.28 LYs (euro104,500.08, 2.92 QALYs and 6.49 LYs for Germany).

12913,Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Upper Airway Stimulation for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Model-Based Projection Based on the STAR Trial,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: Upper airway stimulation (UAS) is a new approach to treat moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea. Recently, 12-month data from the Stimulation Treatment for Apnea Reduction (STAR) trial were reported, evaluating the effectiveness of UAS in patients intolerant or non-adherent to continuous positive airway pressure therapy. Our objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of UAS from a U.S. payer perspective. DESIGN: A 5-state Markov model was used to predict cardiovascular endpoints (myocardial infarction [MI], stroke, hypertension), motor vehicle collisions (MVC), mortality, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs. We computed 10-year relative event risks and the lifetime incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in $/QALY, comparing UAS therapy to no treatment under the assumption that the STAR trial-observed reduction in mean apnea-hypopnea index from 32.0 to 15.3 events/h was maintained. Costs and effects were discounted at 3% per year. SETTING: U.S. healthcare system; third-party payer perspective. PARTICIPANTS: 83% male cohort with mean age of 54.5 years. INTERVENTIONS: UAS vs. no treatment. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: UAS substantially reduced event probabilities over 10 years (relative risks: MI 0.63; stroke 0.75; MVC 0.34), and was projected to add 1.09 QALYs over the patient's lifetime. Costs were estimated to increase by $42,953, resulting in a lifetime ICER of $39,471/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to the acknowledged willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000-$100,000/QALY, our results indicate upper airway stimulation is a cost-effective therapy in the U.S. healthcare system.",2014-01-15731,25348126,Sleep,Jan B Pietzsch,2015,38 / 5,,No,25348126,"Jan B Pietzsch; Shan Liu; Abigail M Garner; Eric J Kezirian; Patrick J Strollo; Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Upper Airway Stimulation for the Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Model-Based Projection Based on the STAR Trial, Sleep, 2015 May; 38(5):0161-8105",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Upper Airway Stimulation vs. None,Not Stated,70 Years,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,39471,United States,2013,43851.56
12914,Tacrolimus Versus Cyclosporine as Primary Immunosuppressant After Renal Transplantation: A Meta-Analysis and Economics Evaluation,"Tacrolimus and cyclosporine are the major immunosuppressants for renal transplantation. Several studies have compared these 2 drugs, but the outcomes were not consistent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacoeconomics of cyclosporine and tacrolimus in the treatment of renal transplantation and provide evidence for the selection of essential drugs. Trials were identified through a computerized literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Renal Group Specialized Register of randomized controlled trials, and Chinese Biomedical database. Two independent reviewers assessed trials for eligibility and quality and then extracted data. Data were extracted for patient and graft mortality, acute rejection, and adverse events. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. A decision tree model was populated with data from a literature review and used to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life years gained and incremental cost-effectiveness. Altogether, 6137 patients from 27 randomized controlled trials were included. The results of our analysis were that tacrolimus reduced the risks after renal transplantation of patient mortality, graft loss, acute rejection, and hypercholesterolemia. Nevertheless, tacrolimus increased the risk of new-onset diabetes. Pharmacoeconomic analysis showed that tacrolimus represented a more cost-effective treatment than does cyclosporine for the prevention of adverse events following renal transplant. Tacrolimus is an effective and safe immunosuppressive agent and it may be more cost-effective than cyclosporine for the primary prevention of graft rejection in renal transplant recipients. However, new-onset diabetes should be closely monitored during the medication period.",2014-01-15733,25299636,Am J Ther,Jin-Yu Liu,2016,23 / 3,,No,25299636,"Jin-Yu Liu; Ru-Xu You; Min Guo; Lu Zeng; Pu Zhou; Lan Zhu; Gang Xu; Juan Li; Dong Liu; Tacrolimus Versus Cyclosporine as Primary Immunosuppressant After Renal Transplantation: A Meta-Analysis and Economics Evaluation, Am J Ther, 2016 May-Jun; 23(3):1075-2765",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tacrolimus vs. Cyclosporine,experienced renal transplantation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-198540.25,China,2012,-35477.13

METHODS: A Markov model with health states defined by best-corrected visual acuity and a 3-month cycle length was developed. It had a healthcare provider (UK National Health Service and personal social services) perspective, a lifetime time horizon, and was based on 2011 prices; future costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3.5 % per annum. Baseline characteristics were based on the phase III RADIANCE (Ranibizumab and vPDT Evaluation in Myopic CNV) study, and year 1 health-state transitions were based on this and the VIP (Verteporfin in Photodynamic Therapy) study. Extensive sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The lifetime cost of treating myopic CNV with ranibizumab was pound12,866, whereas vPDT and observation were associated with total costs of pound14,421 and pound8,163, respectively. Ranibizumab treatment produced higher cumulative quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; 12.99) than vPDT (12.60) or observation (12.45). Ranibizumab treatment was therefore dominant, with greater health gains and lower overall costs than vPDT. Ranibizumab was cost effective compared with observation, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound8,778/QALY. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, ranibizumab had a 100 % and 88 % probability of being cost effective compared with vPDT and observation, respectively, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000/QALY.

DESIGN: Modelling study. SETTING: England. POPULATION: People aged 0-99. INTERVENTIONS: Incremental impact of introductory vaccine strategies simulated with a transmission dynamic model of meningococcal infection and vaccination including potential herd effects. Model parameters included recent evidence on the vaccine characteristics, disease burden, costs of care, litigation costs, and loss of quality of life from disease, including impacts on family and network members. The health impact of vaccination was assessed through cases averted and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cases averted and cost per QALY gained through vaccination; programmes were deemed cost effective against a willingness to pay of pound20,000 (euro25,420, $32,677) per QALY gained from an NHS and personal and social services perspective. RESULTS: In the short term, case reduction is greatest with routine infant immunisation (26.3% of cases averted in the first five years). This strategy could be cost effective at pound3 (euro3.8, $4.9) a vaccine dose, given several favourable assumptions and the use of a quality of life adjustment factor. If the vaccine can disrupt meningococcal transmission more cases are prevented in the long term with an infant and adolescent combined programme (51.8% after 30 years), which could be cost effective at pound4 a vaccine dose.

12930,Cost effectiveness analysis of pharmacokinetically-guided 5-fluorouracil in FOLFOX chemotherapy for metastatic colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Dosing chemotherapy based on BSA results in marked interindividual variability in drug exposure. A randomized trial showed increased OS and decreased toxicity with PK-guided compared with BSA-based 5-FU dosing in patients with mCRC. The objective of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of PK-based 5-FU dosing with BSA-based 5-FU dosing in patients with mCRC receiving FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of PK FOLFOX compared with BSA FOLFOX. Progression risks and cause-specific mortality were extrapolated from the fitted survival models. Costs for administration and management of adverse events were estimated based on 2013 Medicare reimbursement rates and average sale prices. RESULTS: PK FOLFOX provided 2.03 QALYs at a cost of $50,205 compared with BSA FOLFOX, which provided 1.46 QALYs at a cost of $37,173. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $22,695 per QALY. The ICER remained < $50,000 per QALY in all univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: At a $50,000 per QALY threshold, PK FOLFOX is cost effective for mCRC.

12931,Cost-effectiveness of the LABA/LAMA dual bronchodilator indacaterol/glycopyrronium in a Swedish healthcare setting,"BACKGROUND: Indacaterol/glycopyrronium (IND/GLY) is a once-daily inhaled fixed-dose combination of indacaterol (IND), a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA), and glycopyrronium (GLY), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) for use as maintenance treatment to relieve symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in adults. OBJECTIVE: To determine the economic benefits of IND/GLY compared with the free combination of indacaterol and glycopyrronium (IND + GLY), and with the fixed-dose combination of salmeterol/fluticasone (SFC), in a moderate-to-severe COPD population with low-exacerbation risk. The model-based analysis extrapolated results up to lifetime time horizon and calculated costs per quality-adjusted life year. METHODS: Assuming equal efficacy, a cost-minimisation analysis compared IND/GLY vs IND + GLY using model inputs from the double-blind, randomised SHINE trial. The double-blind, randomised ILLUMINATE and TORCH trials were used to analyse cost-effectiveness versus SFC. To consider ICS-related pneumonia events, published odds ratio comparing an ICS-exposed group to a control group of COPD patients was used. Direct and indirect drug costs as well as drug acquisition costs (in Swedish Krona [SEK]) were derived from published Swedish sources. Cost and effects were discounted with 3%. Uncertainty was assessed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA). RESULTS: IND/GLY was cost-saving vs IND + GLY with incremental savings of SEK (EUR) 768 (85), and 3309 (368) per patient over one and five years. IND/GLY was found to be less costly and more effective compared to SFC with cost savings of SEK (EUR) 2744 (303), 8854 (976), 13,938 (1536), 27,495 (3031) and 43,033 (4744) over one, three, five, ten years and lifetime. The PSA indicated that all iterations produced dominant results for IND/GLY. CONCLUSION: IND/GLY is cost-minimising vs IND + GLY and dominates SFC in the maintenance treatment of COPD patients in Sweden.

12932,Exercises to improve function of the rheumatoid hand (SARAH): a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Disease-modifying biological agents and other drug regimens have substantially improved control of disease activity and joint damage in people with rheumatoid arthritis of the hand. However, commensurate changes in function and quality of life are not always noted. Tailored hand exercises might provide additional improvements, but evidence is lacking. We estimated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tailored hand exercises in addition to usual care during 12 months. METHODS: In this pragmatic, multicentre, parallel-group trial, at 17 National Health Service sites across the UK we randomly assigned 490 adults with rheumatoid arthritis who had pain and dysfunction of the hands and had been on a stable drug regimen for at least 3 months, to either usual care or usual care plus a tailored strengthening and stretching hand exercise programme. Participants were randomly assigned with stratification by centre. Allocation was computer generated and unmasked to participants and therapists delivering treatment after randomisation. Outcome assessors and all investigators were masked to allocation. Physiotherapists or occupational therapists gave the treatments. The primary outcome was the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire overall hand function score at 12 months. The analysis was by intention to treat. We calculated cost per quality-adjusted life-year. This trial is registered as ISRCTN 89936343. FINDINGS: Between Oct 5, 2009, and May 10, 2011, we screened 1606 people, of whom 490 were randomly assigned to usual care (n=244) or tailored exercises (n=246). 438 of 490 participants (89%) provided 12 month follow-up data. Improvements in overall hand function were 3.6 points (95% CI 1.5-5.7) in the usual care group and 7.9 points (6.0-9.9) in the exercise group (mean difference between groups 4.3, 95% CI 1.5-7.1; p=0.0028). Pain, drug regimens, and health-care resource use were stable for 12 months, with no difference between the groups. No serious adverse events associated with the treatment were recorded. The cost of tailored hand exercise was pound156 per person; cost per quality-adjusted life-year was pound9549 with the EQ-5D ( pound17,941 with imputation for missing data). INTERPRETATION: We have shown that a tailored hand exercise programme is a worthwhile, low-cost intervention to provide as an adjunct to various drug regimens. Maximisation of the benefits of biological and DMARD regimens in terms of function, disability, and health-related quality of life should be an important treatment aim.

12933,An economic evaluation of a video- and text-based computer-tailored intervention for smoking cessation: a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Although evidence exists for the effectiveness of web-based smoking cessation interventions, information about the cost-effectiveness of these interventions is limited. OBJECTIVE: The study investigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of two web-based computer-tailored (CT) smoking cessation interventions (video- vs. text-based CT) compared to a control condition that received general text-based advice. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, respondents were allocated to the video-based condition (N = 670), the text-based condition (N = 708) or the control condition (N = 721). Societal costs, smoking status, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; EQ-5D-3L) were assessed at baseline, six-and twelve-month follow-up. The incremental costs per abstinent respondent and per QALYs gained were calculated. To account for uncertainty, bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses were carried out. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the three conditions regarding demographics, baseline values of outcomes and societal costs over the three months prior to baseline. Analyses using prolonged abstinence as outcome measure indicated that from a willingness to pay of euro1,500, the video-based intervention was likely to be the most cost-effective treatment, whereas from a willingness to pay of euro50,400, the text-based intervention was likely to be the most cost-effective. With regard to cost-utilities, when quality of life was used as outcome measure, the control condition had the highest probability of being the most preferable treatment. Sensitivity analyses yielded comparable results. CONCLUSION: The video-based CT smoking cessation intervention was the most cost-effective treatment for smoking abstinence after twelve months, varying the willingness to pay per abstinent respondent from euro0 up to euro80,000. With regard to cost-utility, the control condition seemed to be the most preferable treatment. Probably, more time will be required to assess changes in quality of life. Future studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to investigate whether cost-utility results regarding quality of life may change in the long run.

OBJECTIVE: The study investigated the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of two web-based computer-tailored (CT) smoking cessation interventions (video- vs. text-based CT) compared to a control condition that received general text-based advice. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, respondents were allocated to the video-based condition (N = 670), the text-based condition (N = 708) or the control condition (N = 721). Societal costs, smoking status, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs; EQ-5D-3L) were assessed at baseline, six-and twelve-month follow-up. The incremental costs per abstinent respondent and per QALYs gained were calculated. To account for uncertainty, bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses were carried out. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the three conditions regarding demographics, baseline values of outcomes and societal costs over the three months prior to baseline. Analyses using prolonged abstinence as outcome measure indicated that from a willingness to pay of euro1,500, the video-based intervention was likely to be the most cost-effective treatment, whereas from a willingness to pay of euro50,400, the text-based intervention was likely to be the most cost-effective. With regard to cost-utilities, when quality of life was used as outcome measure, the control condition had the highest probability of being the most preferable treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of SOF-based regimens approved in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) versus the standard of care for different genotypes and patient populations (naive or pretreated). METHODS: A Markov model simulating CHC progression was used to estimate disease treatment costs and effects over patients' lifetimes, from the Spanish National Public Healthcare System perspective. Different therapeutic options were analysed for genotypes 1, 2 and 3 in naive population and for genotype 2 and 3 pretreated patients, according to data obtained from clinical trials. A one-way sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the uncertainty of certain parameters: treatment starting age, transition probabilities, drug costs and discount rate. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was also carried out. RESULTS: For the naive population, the option SOF+pegylated-interferon-alpha (pIFN)+ribavirin (RBV) for 12 weeks recorded in SmPC for genotype 1 and 3 versus pIFN+RBV for 24 weeks estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) below the euro40,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) benchmark.

12946,Cost-effectiveness analysis of abiraterone and sipuleucel-T in asymptomatic metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer,"Of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, 0% to 20% experience disease progression to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Recently, 4 novel therapies have been introduced for the treatment of mCRPC; of these, abiraterone and sipuleucel-T have been studied in the asymptomatic, pre-docetaxel population. Both have shown clinical benefits compared with placebo. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of abiraterone acetate and sipuleucel-T compared with prednisone in asymptomatic, pre-docetaxel mCRPC from a US societal perspective. A Markov model was constructed to simulate stable disease, progressed disease, and death. Survival and event rates were derived from published clinical trial data. Costs were derived from the literature and government reimbursement schedules. Outcomes were measured as average cost-effectiveness ratios (ACERs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and net monetary benefits (NMBs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to test the robustness of the model. The base-case ACER was $114K/quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) for abiraterone, $85K/QALY for sipuleucel-T, and $31K/QALY for prednisone. The base-case ICER was $389K/QALY for abiraterone and $547K/QALY for sipuleucel-T. Prednisone dominates both abiraterone and sipuleucel-T in terms of NMB at willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $400K or less. One-way sensitivity analyses revealed that the model was most sensitive to overall survival and utility inputs. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed abiraterone to be cost-effective 50% or more of the time at a WTP of greater than $400K, whereas sipuleucel-T was cost-effective 50% or more of the time at a WTP of greater than $270K.

METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare the lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of dabigatran 110 and 150 mg, rivaroxaban 20 mg and adjusted-dose warfarin from the perspective of the Singapore healthcare system, using clinical data from published studies, utilities from a patient-reported survey and costs from hospital databases. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old AF patients with no contraindications to anticoagulation. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the QALYs were 8.75 with warfarin, 8.73 with dabigatran 110 mg, 8.82 with dabigatran 150 mg, and 9.33 with rivaroxaban. The costs were Singapore dollar (SG$) 34,648 for warfarin, SG$54,919 for dabigatran 110 mg, SG$50,484 for dabigatran 150 mg and SG$51,975 for rivaroxaban.

12952,Cost-effectiveness of cervical total disc replacement vs fusion for the treatment of 2-level symptomatic degenerative disc disease,"IMPORTANCE: Cervical total disc replacement (CTDR) was developed to treat cervical spondylosis, while preserving motion. While anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been the standard of care for 2-level disease, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) suggested similar outcomes. Cost-effectiveness of this intervention has never been elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of CTDR compared with ACDF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were derived from an RCT that followed up 330 patients over 24 months. The original RCT consisted of multi-institutional data including private and academic institutions. Using linear regression for the current study, health states were constructed based on the stratification of the Neck Disability Index and a visual analog scale. Data from the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey questionnaires were transformed into utilities values using the SF-6D mapping algorithm. Costs were calculated by extracting Diagnosis-Related Group codes from institutional billing data and then applying 2012 Medicare reimbursement rates. The costs of complications and return-to-work data were also calculated. A Markov model was built to evaluate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for both treatment groups. The model adopted a third-party payer perspective and applied a 3% annual discount rate. Patients included in the original RCT had to be diagnosed as having radiculopathy or myeloradiculopathy at 2 contiguous levels from C3-C7 that was unresponsive to conservative treatment for at least 6 weeks or demonstrated progressive symptoms. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CTDR compared with ACDF. RESULTS: A strong correlation (R2 = 0.6864; P < .001) was found by projecting a visual analog scale onto the Neck Disability Index. Cervical total disc replacement had an average of 1.58 QALYs after 24 months compared with 1.50 QALYs for ACDF recipients. Cervical total disc replacement was associated with $2139 greater average cost. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CTDR compared with ACDF was $24,594 per QALY at 2 years. Despite varying input parameters in the sensitivity analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio value stays below the threshold of $50,000 per QALY in most scenarios (range, -$58,194 to $147,862 per QALY). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CTDR compared with traditional ACDF is lower than the commonly accepted threshold of $50,000 per QALY. This remains true with varying input parameters in a robust sensitivity analysis, reaffirming the stability of the model and the sustainability of this intervention.",2014-01-15777,25321869,JAMA Surg,Jared D Ament,2014,149 / 12,1231-9,No,25321869,"Jared D Ament; Zhuo Yang; Pierce Nunley; Marcus B Stone; Kee D Kim; Cost-effectiveness of cervical total disc replacement vs fusion for the treatment of 2-level symptomatic degenerative disc disease, JAMA Surg, ; 149(12):2168-6262; 1231-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cervical total disc replacement vs. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,24594,United States,2012,27723.71
12953,Real life cost and quality of life associated with continuous intraduodenal levodopa infusion compared with oral treatment in Parkinson patients,"Advanced-stage Parkinson's disease (PD) strongly affects quality of life (QoL). Continuous intraduodenal administration of levodopa (IDL) is efficacious, but entails high costs. This study aims to estimate these costs in routine care. 10 patients with advanced-PD who switched from oral medication to IDL were assessed at baseline, and subsequently at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months follow-up. We used the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) for function and 15D for Quality of Life (QoL). Costs were assessed using quarterly structured patient questionnaires and hospital registries. Costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated for conventional treatment prior to switch and for 1-year treatment with IDL. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was based on bootstrapping. IDL significantly improved functional scores and was safe to use. One-year conventional oral treatment entailed 0.63 QALY while IDL entailed 0.68 (p > 0.05). The estimated total 1-year treatment cost was NOK419,160 on conventional treatment and NOK890,920 on IDL, representing a cost of NOK9.2 million (euro1.18 mill) per additional QALY. The incremental cost per unit UPDRS improvement was NOK25,000 (euro3,250). Medication was the dominant cost during IDL (45% of total costs), it represented only 6.4% of the total for conventional treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative cost-effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (with autograft, allograft, or spacers), anterior cervical discectomy without fusion (ACD), and cervical disc replacement (CDR) for the treatment of 1-level cervical disc disease. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is debate as to the optimal anterior surgical strategy to treat single-level cervical disc disease. Surgical strategies include 3 techniques of anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (autograft, allograft, or spacer-assisted fusion), ACD, and CDR. Several controlled trials have compared these treatments but have yielded mixed results. Decision analysis provides a structure for making a quantitative comparison of the costs and outcomes of each treatment. METHODS: A literature search was performed and yielded 156 case series that fulfilled our search criteria describing nearly 17,000 cases. Data were abstracted from these publications and pooled meta-analytically to estimate the incidence of various outcomes, including index-level and adjacent-level reoperation. A decision analytic model calculated the expected costs in US dollars and outcomes in quality-adjusted life years for a typical adult patient with 1-level cervical radiculopathy subjected to each of the 5 approaches. RESULTS: At 5 years postoperatively, patients who had undergone ACD alone had significantly (P < 0.001) more quality-adjusted life years (4.885 +/- 0.041) than those receiving other treatments. Patients with ACD also exhibited highly significant (P < 0.001) differences in costs, incurring the lowest societal costs ($16,558 +/- $539). Follow-up data were inadequate for comparison beyond 5 years. CONCLUSION: The results of our decision analytic model indicate advantages for ACD, both in effectiveness and costs, over other strategies. Thus, ACD is a cost-effective alternative to anterior cervical discectomy with fusion and CDR in patients with single-level cervical disc disease.

METHODS: A literature search was performed and yielded 156 case series that fulfilled our search criteria describing nearly 17,000 cases. Data were abstracted from these publications and pooled meta-analytically to estimate the incidence of various outcomes, including index-level and adjacent-level reoperation. A decision analytic model calculated the expected costs in US dollars and outcomes in quality-adjusted life years for a typical adult patient with 1-level cervical radiculopathy subjected to each of the 5 approaches. RESULTS: At 5 years postoperatively, patients who had undergone ACD alone had significantly (P < 0.001) more quality-adjusted life years (4.885 +/- 0.041) than those receiving other treatments. Patients with ACD also exhibited highly significant (P < 0.001) differences in costs, incurring the lowest societal costs ($16,558 +/- $539). Follow-up data were inadequate for comparison beyond 5 years. CONCLUSION: The results of our decision analytic model indicate advantages for ACD, both in effectiveness and costs, over other strategies. Thus, ACD is a cost-effective alternative to anterior cervical discectomy with fusion and CDR in patients with single-level cervical disc disease. Definitive conclusions about degenerative changes after ACD and adjacent-level disease after CDR await longer follow-up.

12957,Anterior surgical management of single-level cervical disc disease: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"STUDY DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis with decision analysis and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative cost-effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (with autograft, allograft, or spacers), anterior cervical discectomy without fusion (ACD), and cervical disc replacement (CDR) for the treatment of 1-level cervical disc disease. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is debate as to the optimal anterior surgical strategy to treat single-level cervical disc disease. Surgical strategies include 3 techniques of anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (autograft, allograft, or spacer-assisted fusion), ACD, and CDR. Several controlled trials have compared these treatments but have yielded mixed results.

The objective of the current study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 10 kHz high-frequency SCS (HF10 SCS) compared to conventional medical management (CMM), reoperation, and traditional nonrechargeable (TNR-SCS) and rechargeable SCS (TR-SCS). METHODS: A health economic model of SCS in the United Kingdom was reproduced in the perspective of the health care system to simulate costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) over 15 years. In the model, both a decision tree and the Markov model were used to describe the health outcomes of the evaluated therapies. RESULTS: HF10 SCS therapy showed a favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound3,153 per QALY gained as compared to CMM and established dominance (less costly, more QALYs) compared to TNR-SCS ( pound8,802 per QALY vs. CMM) and TR-SCS ( pound5,101 per QALY vs. CMM).

This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS) and endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) compared with conventional surgery as treatment for primary varicose veins. METHODS: Participant cost and utility data were collected alongside the UK CLASS multicentre randomized clinical trial, which compared EVLA, surgery and UGFS. Regression methods were used to estimate the effects of the alternative treatments on costs to the health service and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 6 months. A Markov model, incorporating available evidence on clinical recurrence rates, was developed to extrapolate the trial data over a 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: Compared with surgery at 6 months, UGFS and EVLA reduced mean costs to the health service by pound655 and pound160 respectively. When additional overhead costs associated with theatre use were included, these cost savings increased to pound902 and pound392 respectively. UGFS produced 0.005 fewer QALYs, whereas EVLA produced 0.011 additional QALYs. Extrapolating to 5 years, EVLA was associated with increased costs and QALYs compared with UGFS (costing pound3640 per QALY gained), and generated a cost saving ( pound206-439) and QALY gain (0.078) compared with surgery. Applying a ceiling willingness-to-pay ratio of pound20 000 per QALY gained, EVLA had the highest probability (78.7 per cent) of being cost-effective.

12964,Cost-effectiveness analysis of fixation options for intertrochanteric hip fractures,"BACKGROUND: Intertrochanteric hip fractures are a major source of morbidity and financial burden, accounting for 7% of osteoporotic fractures and costing nearly $6 billion annually in the United States. Traditionally, ""stable"" fracture patterns have been treated with an extramedullary sliding hip screw whereas ""unstable"" patterns have been treated with the more expensive intramedullary nail. The purpose of this study was to identify parameters to guide cost-effective implant choices with use of decision-analysis techniques to model these common clinical scenarios. METHODS: An expected-value decision-analysis model was constructed to estimate the total costs and health utility based on the choice of a sliding hip screw or an intramedullary nail for fixation of an intertrochanteric hip fracture. Values for critical parameters, such as fixation failure rate, were derived from the literature. Three scenarios were evaluated: (1) a clearly stable fracture (AO type 31-A1), (2) a clearly unstable fracture (A3), or (3) a fracture with questionable stability (A2). Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the validity of the model. RESULTS: The fixation failure rate and implant cost were the most important factors in determining implant choice. When the incremental cost for the intramedullary nail was set at the median value ($1200), intramedullary nailing had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $50,000/quality-adjusted life year when the incremental failure rate of sliding hip screws was 1.9%. When the incremental failure rate of sliding hip screws was >5.0%, intramedullary nails dominated with lower cost and better health outcomes. The sliding hip screw was always more cost-effective for A1 fractures, and the intramedullary nail always dominated for A3 fractures. As for A2 fractures, the sliding hip screw was cost-effective in 70% of the cases, although this was highly sensitive to the failure rate. CONCLUSIONS: Sliding hip screw fixation is likely more cost-effective for stable intertrochanteric fractures (A1) or those with questionable stability (A2), whereas intramedullary nail fixation is more cost-effective for reverse obliquity fractures (A3).

12967,Cost-effectiveness of endobronchial valve therapy for severe emphysema: a model-based projection based on the VENT study,"BACKGROUND: Endobronchial valve (EBV) therapy is an innovative treatment that has been shown to be safe and effective in selected subgroups of patients with severe emphysema. OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of EBV therapy compared to the medical management of patients with high heterogeneity, complete fissures and lobar exclusion in the context of the German health-care system. METHODS: Clinical data from a subset of VENT (Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema Palliation Trial) provided information about clinical events, health-related quality of life, and disease staging for 12 months. This information was subsequently used to project long-term disease progression, mortality, and health resource utilization. We computed the 5- and 10-year incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs and effects were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: EBV therapy led to clinically meaningful disease restaging at 12 months (37.8% of the cohort improved staging, compared to 0% in the controls). Over 5 years, EBV therapy was projected to increase survival from 66.4 to 70.7%, and to add 0.22 QALYs. Costs were estimated to increase by EUR 10,299, resulting in an ICER of EUR 46,322 per QALY. Over 10 years, 0.41 QALYs were gained at an additional cost of EUR 10,425, yielding an ICER of EUR 25,142 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Our model-based analysis suggests that EBV therapy leads to clinically meaningful changes in disease staging and progression when compared to medical management, with resulting gains in unadjusted and quality-adjusted life expectancy.

12968,Cost-utility of ferric carboxymaltose (Ferinject(R)) for iron-deficiency anemia patients with chronic heart failure in South Korea,"BACKGROUND: Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is prevalent in patients with advanced chronic heart failure (CHF). It affects the patients' overall physical condition and is suggested as a strong outcome predictor in CHF. Recent clinical trials suggested that intravenous iron supplementation improves CHF functional status and quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ferric carboxymaltose(FCM) in CHF patients with IDA. METHODS: Ferric carboxymaltose, an intravenous iron preparation, was compared with placebo. The target population comprised CHF patients with IDA in hospital and outpatient care settings. We conducted this study from the Korean healthcare payers' perspective with a time horizon of 24 weeks. One clinical trial provided the clinical outcomes of ferric carboxymaltose therapy. The improvement rates of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in the placebo and ferric carboxymaltose groups were used to estimate effectiveness in the base-case model. We also conducted a scenario 2 analysis using quality of life investigated in the clinical trial. A panel survey was conducted to obtain the ratio of healthcare resource use based on NYHA class in Korea. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as incremental cost (US dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ferric carboxymaltose compared with placebo was $22,192 (25,010,451) per QALY gained. The sensitivity analysis showed robust results, with the ICERs of ferric carboxymaltose ranging from $5,156 to $29,796 per QALY gained. In the scenario 2 analysis, ICER decreased to $12,598 (14,198,501) per QALY gained.

12969,Incremental cost-effectiveness of percutaneous versus surgical closure of atrial septal defects in children under a public health system perspective in Brazil,"INTRODUCTION: Cost-effectiveness (CE) studies of percutaneous (PC) versus surgical (SC) atrial septal defect closure are lacking. METHODS: A systematic literature review in children and a CE analysis based on a model of long-term outcomes were performed. Direct costs of PC and SC were US$8700 (defined arbitrarily) and US$5700 (actually paid), respectively. Three-times the Brazilian GDI (US$28,700) per year of life saved (with a discount rate of 5%) was used as a limit for willingness-to-pay. DISCUSSION: PC had a high (US$104,500) incremental CE ratio despite lower complication rates, shorter hospital stay and better (nonsignificant) adjusted life expectancy. PC would be cost-effective if it cost US$6400 or SC had an 8% loss of utility or its indirect costs were US$2250. Costs of PC should be reduced to be cost-effective in the Brazilian public health system. Indirect costs and impact on quality of life should be further assessed.",2014-01-15805,25284446,Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther,Rodrigo Costa,2014,12 / 11,1369-78,No,25284446,"Rodrigo Costa; Carlos A C Pedra; Marcelo Ribeiro; Simone Pedra; Andre Luis Ferreira-Da-Silva; Carisi Polanczyk; Otavio Berwanger; Alexandre Biasi; Rodrigo Ribeiro; Incremental cost-effectiveness of percutaneous versus surgical closure of atrial septal defects in children under a public health system perspective in Brazil, Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther, ; 12(11):1744-8344; 1369-78",QALY,Brazil,Not Stated,Not Stated,Percutaneous closure vs. Standard/Usual Care- Surgical closure,Not Stated,6 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,5.00,230641,Brazil,2012,133656.5
12970,Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in men who have sex with men: risk calculators for real-world decision-making,"BACKGROUND: Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) can be clinically effective and cost-effective for HIV prevention in high-risk men who have sex with men (MSM). However, individual patients have different risk profiles, real-world populations vary, and no practical tools exist to guide clinical decisions or public health strategies. We introduce a practical model of HIV acquisition, including both a personalized risk calculator for clinical management and a cost-effectiveness calculator for population-level decisions. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model of PrEP for MSM. The primary clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness outcomes were the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one HIV infection, and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We characterized patients according to risk factors including PrEP adherence, condom use, sexual frequency, background HIV prevalence and antiretroviral therapy use. RESULTS: With standard PrEP adherence and national epidemiologic parameters, the estimated NNT was 64 (95% uncertainty range: 26, 176) at a cost of $160,000 (cost saving, $740,000) per QALY--comparable to other published models. With high (35%) HIV prevalence, the NNT was 35 (21, 57), and cost per QALY was $27,000 (cost saving, $160,000), and with high PrEP adherence, the NNT was 30 (14, 69), and cost per QALY was $3,000 (cost saving, $200,000). In contrast, for monogamous, serodiscordant relationships with partner antiretroviral therapy use, the NNT was 90 (39, 157) and cost per QALY was $280,000 ($14,000, $670,000).

12971,Cost effectiveness of molecular profiling for adjuvant decision making in patients with node-negative breast cancer,"PURPOSE: To conduct an economic evaluation of the 70-gene signature used to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decision making both in patients with node-negative breast cancer (NNBC) and in the subgroup of estrogen receptor (ER) -positive patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used a mixed approach combining patient-level data from a multicenter validation study of the 70-gene signature (untreated patients) and secondary sources for chemotherapy efficacy, unit costs, and utility values. Three strategies on which to base the decision to administer adjuvant chemotherapy were compared: the 70-gene signature, Adjuvant! Online, and chemotherapy in all patients. In the base-case analysis, costs from the French National Insurance Scheme, life-years (LYs), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were computed for the three strategies over a 10-year period. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves using the net monetary benefit were computed, combining bootstrap and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The mean differences in LYs and QALYs were similar between the three strategies. The 70-gene signature strategy was associated with a higher cost, with a mean difference of euro2,037 (range, euro1,472 to euro2,515) compared with Adjuvant!

12973,The economic effect of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation to support adults with severe respiratory failure in Brazil: a hypothetical analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-utility of using extracorporeal oxygenation for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in Brazil. METHODS: A decision tree was constructed using databases from previously published studies. Costs were taken from the average price paid by the Brazilian Unified Health System (Sistema Unico de Saude; SUS) over three months in 2011. Using the data of 10,000,000 simulated patients with predetermined outcomes and costs, an analysis was performed of the ratio between cost increase and years of life gained, adjusted for quality (cost-utility), with survival rates of 40 and 60% for patients using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: The decision tree resulted in 16 outcomes with different life support techniques. With survival rates of 40 and 60%, respectively, the increased costs were R$=-301.00/-14.00, with a cost of R$=-30,913.00/-1,752.00 paid per six-month quality-adjusted life-year gained and R$=-2,386.00/-90.00 per quality-adjusted life-year gained until the end of life, when all patients with severe ARDS were analyzed. Analyzing only patients with severe hypoxemia (i.e., a ratio of partial oxygen pressure in the blood to the fraction of inspired oxygen <100 mmHg), the increased cost was R$=-5,714.00/272.00, with a cost per six-month quality-adjusted life-year gained of R$=-9,521.00/293.00 and a cost of R$=-280.00/7.00 per quality-adjusted life-year gained.

AIM: To explore the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic colorectal surgery, compared to open methods, using quality of life data gathered in the first 6 weeks after surgery. METHODS: Participants were recruited in 2006-2007 in a district general hospital in the south of England; those with a diagnosis of cancer or polyps were included in the analysis. Quality of life data were collected using EQ-5D, on alternate days after surgery for 4 weeks. Costs per patient, from a National Health Service perspective (in British pounds, 2006) comprised the sum of operative, hospital, and community costs. Missing data were filled using multiple imputation methods. The difference in mean quality adjusted life years and costs between surgery groups were estimated simultaneously using a multivariate regression model applied to 20 imputed datasets. The probability that laparoscopic surgery is cost-effective compared to open surgery for a given societal willingness-to-pay threshold is illustrated using a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. RESULTS: The sample comprised 68 laparoscopic and 27 open surgery patients. At 28 days, the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year gained from laparoscopic surgery was pound12,375. At a societal willingness-to-pay of pound30,000, the probability that laparoscopic surgery is cost-effective, exceeds 65% (at pound20,000 approximately 60%). In sensitivity analyses, laparoscopic surgery remained cost-effective compared to open surgery, provided it results in a saving >/= pound699 in hospital bed days and takes no more than 8 minutes longer to perform.

METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model, a validated computer simulation model, was adapted to the Greek healthcare setting. Patient and intervention effects data were gathered from a clinical trial comparing liraglutide 1.2 mg once daily vs. sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, both combined with metformin, and a clinical trial comparing liraglutide 1.8 mg once daily vs. exenatide 10 mug twice daily, both as add-on to metformin, glimepiride or both. Direct costs were reported in 2013 Euros and calculated based on published and local sources. All future outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum, and the analysis was conducted from the perspective of a third-party payer in Greece. RESULTS: Over a patient's lifetime, treatment with liraglutide 1.2 mg vs. sitagliptin drove a mean increase in discounted life expectancy of 0.13 (SD 0.23) years and in discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.19 (0.16) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), whereas therapy with liraglutide 1.8 mg vs. exenatide yielded increases of 0.14 (0.23) years and 0.19 (0.16) QALYs respectively.

12977,Cost effectiveness of percutaneous closure versus medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke in patients with a patent foramen ovale,"In patients with patent foramen ovales (PFOs) and cryptogenic stroke, observational studies have demonstrated reductions in recurrent neurologic events with transcatheter PFO closure compared with medical therapy. Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown a trend toward benefit with device closure. The cost-effectiveness of PFO closure has not been described. Therefore, a detailed cost analysis was performed using pooled weighted outcome and complication rates from published randomized controlled trials, Medicare cost tables, and wholesale medication prices. Incremental cost per life-year gained and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by PFO closure was calculated. The commonly accepted cost-effectiveness threshold of <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained was used. At 2.6 years (the mean duration of randomized controlled trial follow-up), PFO closure was more costly ($16,213, 95% confidence interval [CI] $15,753 to $16,749) per patient, with a cost of $103,607 (95% CI $5,826 to $2,544,750) per life-year gained. The expenditure to prevent 1 combined end point (transient ischemic attack, stroke, and death) at 2.6 years was $1.09 million (95% CI $1.04 million to $1.20 million). Modeling the costs of medical treatment prospectively, PFO closure reached cost-effectiveness (<$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year gained) at 2.6 years (95% CI 1.5 to 44.2). At 30.2 years (95% CI 28.2 to 36.2), the per patient mean cost of medical therapy exceeded that of PFO closure. In conclusion, PFO closure is associated with higher expenditures related to procedural costs; however, this increase may be offset over time by reduced event rates and costs of long-term medical treatment in patients who undergo transcatheter PFO closure. In younger patients typical of cryptogenic stroke, PFO closure may be cost effective in the long term.",2014-01-15840,25248812,Am J Cardiol,Christopher A Pickett,2014,114 / 10,1584-9,No,25248812,"Christopher A Pickett; Todd C Villines; Michael A Ferguson; Edward A Hulten; Cost effectiveness of percutaneous closure versus medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke in patients with a patent foramen ovale, Am J Cardiol, ; 114(10):0002-9149; 1584-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Percutaneous closure vs. Medical therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,"2 Years, 5, 30",Not Stated,Not Stated,50692,United States,2012,57142.81
12978,"Pan computed tomography versus selective computed tomography in stable, young adults after blunt trauma with moderate mechanism: a cost-utility analysis","BACKGROUND: Pan computed tomography (PCT) of the head, cervical spine, chest, abdomen, and pelvis is a valuable approach for rapid evaluation of severely injured blunt trauma patients. A PCT strategy has also been applied for the evaluation of patients with lower injury severity; however, the cost-utility of this approach is undetermined. The advantage of rapidly identifying all injuries via PCT must be weighed against the risk of radiation-induced cancer (RIC). Our objective was to compare the cost-utility of PCT with selective computed tomography (SCT) in the management of blunt trauma patients with low injury severity. METHODS: A Markov model-based, cost-utility analysis of a hypothetical cohort of hemodynamically stable, 30-year-old males evaluated in a trauma center after motor vehicle crash was used. CT scans are performed based on the mechanism of injury. The analysis compared PCT with SCT over a 1-year time frame with an analytic horizon over the lifespan of the patients. The possible outcomes, utilities of health states, and health care costs including RIC were derived from the published medical literature and public data. Costs were measured in US 2010 dollars, and incremental effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with 3% annual discounted rates. Multiway sensitivity analyses were performed on all variables. RESULTS: The total cost for blunt trauma patients undergoing PCT was $15,682 versus $17,673 for SCT. There was no difference in QALYs between the two populations (26.42 vs. 26.40). However, there was a cost savings of $75 per QALY for patients receiving PCT versus SCT ($594 per QALY vs. $669 per QALY). CONCLUSION: PCT enables surgeons to identify and rule out injuries promptly, thereby reducing the need for inpatient observation. The risk of RIC is low following a single PCT. This cost-utility analysis finds PCT based on mechanism to be a cost-effective use of resources.

12979,The Use of Mesh Versus Primary Fascial Closure of the Abdominal Donor Site When Using a Transverse Rectus Abdominus Myocutaneous (TRAM) Flap for Breast Reconstruction: A Cost-Utility Analysis,"Background: During breast reconstruction using the transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, the use of mesh for abdominal donor-site closure provides for a technology that potentially offers clinical benefit yet incurs an added cost. The authors' goal was to determine whether it is cost effective to use mesh during abdominal donor-site closure when performing a TRAM flap for breast reconstruction. Methods: A literature review was conducted to identify and collect published hernia and bulge rates at abdominal TRAM flap donor sites closed either primarily or with mesh. A decision tree analysis was performed. Outcome probabilities, costs of complications, and expert utility estimates were populated into the decision tree model to evaluate the cost-utility of using mesh in TRAM abdominal donor-site closure. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to verify the robustness of the results. Results: The authors' literature review resulted in 10 articles describing 1195 patients who had TRAM abdominal donor-site closure primarily and 696 patients who had donor-site closure performed with mesh. Pooled hernia/bulge complication rates for these two groups were 7.87 percent and 4.45 percent, respectively. The use of mesh was more clinically effective based on total quality-adjusted life-years gained of 30.53 compared with 30.41 when performing primary fascial closure alone. The incremental additional cost incurred by the mesh arm when running the decision tree model was $693.14. This difference in cost, divided by the difference in clinical efficacy (0.12), results in an incremental cost-utility ratio value of $5776.17 per quality-adjusted life-year gained when using mesh, making it cost effective (when using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000). One-way sensitivity analysis revealed the following: (1) using mesh was a cost effective option, provided that the price of mesh was less than or equal to $5970; (2) mesh was cost effective when its use led to a hernia/bulge rate less than or equal to 7.25 percent; and (3) primary facial closure was cost effective when its use led to a hernia/bulge rate less than or equal to 4.75 percent.

12980,Cost-effectiveness analysis parallel to a randomized controlled trial comparing vertical scar reduction and inverted T-shaped reduction mammaplasty,"BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial showed no clear superiority of vertical scar over inverted T-shaped reduction mammaplasty in terms of health-related quality of life. No economic evaluation has been undertaken comparing vertical scar reduction and inverted T -shaped reduction. METHODS: A total of 255 patients were randomized to either vertical scar or inverted T -shaped reduction. The effectiveness was measured with the Health Utilities Index Mark 3. Direct and productivity costs were captured parallel to the randomized controlled trial. Perspectives of the Ministry of Health, patient, and society were considered. RESULTS: Inverted T -shaped reduction dominated vertical scar reduction from the Ministry of Health perspective by being slightly less costly ($3090.06 versus $3106.58) and slightly more effective (0.87 quality-adjusted life-years versus 0.86 quality-adjusted life-years). From the societal and patient perspectives, vertical scar reduction was both less costly and less effective. At the commonly quoted Canadian threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained, the probability that vertical scar reduction was cost-effective was 29.3, 68.2, and 66.9 percent from the Ministry of Health, patient, and societal perspectives. Subgroup analysis of reductions less than 500 g found that vertical scar reduction was more likely cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Vertical scar reduction is more likely than not cost-effective from patient and societal perspectives but not from the Ministry of Health perspective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. If we limit vertical scar reduction for resections less than 500 g per breast, this technique is more likely cost-effective from all perspectives.",2014-01-15848,25255113,Plast Reconstr Surg,Achilleas Thoma,2014,134 / 6,1093-107,No,25255113,"Achilleas Thoma; Manraj Nirmal Kaur; Bernice Tsoi; Natalia Ziolkowski; Eric Duku; Charles Harry Goldsmith; Cost-effectiveness analysis parallel to a randomized controlled trial comparing vertical scar reduction and inverted T-shaped reduction mammaplasty, Plast Reconstr Surg, ; 134(6):0032-1052; 1093-107",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vertical Scar Reduction Mammaplasty vs. Inverted T-Shaped Reduction Mammaplasty,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-1652,Canada,2012,-1862.65
12981,Potential cost-effectiveness of therapeutic drug monitoring in patients with resistant hypertension,"BACKGROUND: Nonadherence to drug therapy poses a significant problem in the treatment of patients with presumed resistant hypertension. It has been shown that therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is a useful tool for detecting nonadherence and identifying barriers to treatment adherence, leading to effective blood pressure (BP) control. However, the cost-effectiveness of TDM in the management of resistant hypertension has not been investigated. METHOD: A Markov model was used to evaluate life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in resistant hypertension patients receiving either TDM optimized therapy or standard best medical therapy. The model ran from the age of 30 to 100 years or death, using a cycle length of 1 year. Efficacy of TDM was modeled by reducing risk of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality. Cost analyses were performed from a payer's perspective. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the age group of 60-year olds, TDM gained 1.07 QALYs in men and 0.97 QALYs in women at additional costs of euro3854 and euro3922, respectively. Given a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro35,000 per QALY gained, the probability of TDM being cost-effective was 95% or more in all age groups from 30 to 90 years. Results were influenced mostly by the frequency of TDM testing, the rate of nonresponders to TDM, and the magnitude of effect of TDM on BP.

12983,The cost-effectiveness of a theory-based online health behaviour intervention for new university students: an economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Too many young people engage in unhealthy behaviours such as eating unhealthily, being physically inactive, binge drinking and smoking. This study aimed to estimate the short-term and long-term cost-effectiveness of a theory-based online health behaviour intervention (""U@Uni"") in comparison with control in young people starting university. METHODS: A costing analysis was conducted to estimate the full cost of U@Uni and the cost of U@Uni roll-out. The short-term cost-effectiveness of U@Uni was estimated using statistical analysis of 6-month cost and health-related quality of life data from the U@Uni randomised controlled trial. An economic modelling analysis combined evidence from the trial with published evidence of the effect of health behaviours on mortality risk and general population data on health behaviours, to estimate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of U@Uni in terms of incremental cost per QALY. Costs and effects were discounted at 1.5% per annum. A full probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to account for uncertainty in model inputs and provide an estimate of the value of information for groups of important parameters. RESULTS: To implement U@Uni for the randomised controlled trial was estimated to cost pound292 per participant, whereas roll-out to another university was estimated to cost pound19.71, both giving a QALY gain of 0.0128 per participant. The short-term (6-month) analysis suggested that U@Uni would not be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY (incremental cost per QALY gained = pound243,926). When a lifetime horizon was adopted the results suggest that the full implementation of U@Uni is unlikely to be cost-effective, whereas the roll-out of U@Uni to another university is extremely likely to be cost-effective. The value of information analysis suggests that the most important drivers of decision uncertainty are uncertainties in the effect of U@Uni on health behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides the first estimate of the costs and cost-effectiveness of an online health behaviour intervention targeted at new university students. The results suggest that the roll-out, but not the full implementation, of U@Uni would be a cost-effective decision for the UK Department of Health, given a lifetime perspective and a willingness-to pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY.

12984,Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of a Web-based or print-delivered tailored intervention to promote physical activity among adults aged over fifty: an economic evaluation of the Active Plus intervention,"BACKGROUND: The adverse health effects of insufficient physical activity (PA) result in high costs to society. The economic burden of insufficient PA, which increases in our aging population, stresses the urgency for cost-effective interventions to promote PA among older adults. The current study provides insight in the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of different versions of a tailored PA intervention (Active Plus) among adults aged over fifty. METHODS: The intervention conditions (i.e. print-delivered basic (PB; N = 439), print-delivered environmental (PE; N = 435), Web-based basic (WB; N = 423), Web-based environmental (WE; N = 432)) and a waiting-list control group were studied in a clustered randomized controlled trial. Intervention costs were registered during the trial. Health care costs, participant costs and productivity losses were identified and compared with the intervention effects on PA (in MET-hours per week) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 12 months after the start of the intervention. Cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated per intervention condition. Non-parametric bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty. RESULTS: As a whole (i.e. the four intervention conditions together) the Active Plus intervention was found to be cost-effective. The PB-intervention (ICER = euro-55/MET-hour), PE-intervention (ICER = euro-94/MET-hour) and the WE-intervention (ICER = euro-139/MET-hour) all resulted in higher effects on PA and lower societal costs than the control group. With regard to QALYs, the PB-intervention (ICUR = euro38,120/QALY), the PE-intervention (ICUR = euro405,892/QALY) and the WE-intervention (ICUR = euro-47,293/QALY) were found to be cost-effective when considering a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000/QALY. In most cases PE had the highest probability to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The Active Plus intervention was found to be a cost-effective manner to increase PA in a population aged over fifty when compared to no-intervention. The tailored Active Plus intervention delivered through printed material and with additional environmental information (PE) turned out to be the most cost-effective intervention condition as confirmed by the different sensitivity analyses.

CONCLUSIONS: The Active Plus intervention was found to be a cost-effective manner to increase PA in a population aged over fifty when compared to no-intervention. The tailored Active Plus intervention delivered through printed material and with additional environmental information (PE) turned out to be the most cost-effective intervention condition as confirmed by the different sensitivity analyses.

The economic burden of insufficient PA, which increases in our aging population, stresses the urgency for cost-effective interventions to promote PA among older adults. The current study provides insight in the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of different versions of a tailored PA intervention (Active Plus) among adults aged over fifty. METHODS: The intervention conditions (i.e. print-delivered basic (PB; N = 439), print-delivered environmental (PE; N = 435), Web-based basic (WB; N = 423), Web-based environmental (WE; N = 432)) and a waiting-list control group were studied in a clustered randomized controlled trial. Intervention costs were registered during the trial. Health care costs, participant costs and productivity losses were identified and compared with the intervention effects on PA (in MET-hours per week) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) 12 months after the start of the intervention. Cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated per intervention condition. Non-parametric bootstrapping techniques and sensitivity analyses were performed to account for uncertainty. RESULTS: As a whole (i.e. the four intervention conditions together) the Active Plus intervention was found to be cost-effective. The PB-intervention (ICER = euro-55/MET-hour), PE-intervention (ICER = euro-94/MET-hour) and the WE-intervention (ICER = euro-139/MET-hour) all resulted in higher effects on PA and lower societal costs than the control group.

12993,"Cost-utility analysis of oral anticoagulants for nonvalvular atrial fibrillation patients at the police general hospital, Bangkok, Thailand","PURPOSE: The genetic polymorphism was one of the major considerations for adjusting doses of warfarin in Thai individuals. As a result, new oral anticoagulants (NOACs) were introduced to achieve therapeutic goals in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (SPAF) patients. However, a cost-utility analysis in a population-specific model was lacking in Thailand. This study was performed to determine which NOACs yielded population-specific, cost-effective results for SPAF compared with warfarin from both governmental and societal perspectives in Thailand. METHODS: A simplified Markov health state model was constructed to calculate the lifetime cost, life-years saved, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Asia-specific clinical event parameters were defined from systematic searches of PubMed. Cost and utility input was obtained from hospital based data collection. FINDINGS: Although NOACs produced more life-years saved and QALYs gained resulting from the base-case versus warfarin, the lifetime costs of new alternatives increased to >1.4 times the comparative cost of warfarin. This caused an incremental cost-effective ratio that exceeded Thailand's cost-effectiveness threshold. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis denoted the robustness of our model and revealed that dose-adjusted warfarin was the most cost-effective option in >99% of iterations. NOACs produced cost-effective results when the medication unit cost was decreased by at least 85%.

12997,DVT surveillance program in the ICU: analysis of cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND: Venous Thrombo-embolism (VTE--Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE)--in traumatized patients causes significant morbidity and mortality. The current study evaluates the effectiveness of DVT surveillance in reducing PE, and performs a cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: All traumatized patients admitted to the adult ICU underwent twice weekly DVT surveillance by bilateral lower extremity venous Duplex examination (48-month surveillance period--SP). The rates of DVT and PE were recorded and compared to the rates observed in the 36-month pre-surveillance period (PSP). All patients in both periods received mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis unless contraindicated. Total costs--diagnostic, therapeutic and surveillance--for both periods were recorded and the incremental cost for each Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) gained was calculated. RESULTS: 4234 patients were eligible (PSP--1422 and SP--2812). Rate of DVT in SP (2.8%) was significantly higher than in PSP (1.3%) - p<0.05, and rate of PE in SP (0.7%) was significantly lower than that in PSP (1.5%) - p<0.05. Logistic regression demonstrated that surveillance was an independent predictor of increased DVT detection (OR: 2.53 - CI: 1.462-4.378) and decreased PE incidence (OR: 0.487 - CI: 0.262-0.904). The incremental cost was $509,091/life saved in the base case, translating to $29,102/QALY gained. A sensitivity analysis over four of the parameters used in the model indicated that the incremental cost ranged from $18,661 to $48,821/QALY gained.

12998,Cost-utility of cognitive behavioral therapy versus U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended drugs and usual care in the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia: an economic evaluation alongside a 6-month randomized controlled trial,"INTRODUCTION: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended pharmacologic treatments (RPTs; pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran) are effective treatment options for fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome and are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. We compared the cost-utility from the healthcare and societal perspectives of CBT versus RPT (combination of pregabalin + duloxetine) and usual care (TAU) groups in the treatment of FM. METHODS: The economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 6-month, multicenter, randomized, blinded, parallel group, controlled trial. In total, 168 FM patients from 41 general practices in Zaragoza (Spain) were randomized to CBT (n = 57), RPT (n = 56), or TAU (n = 55). The main outcome measures were Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs, assessed by using the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire) and improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL, assessed by using EuroQoL-5D visual analogue scale, EQ-VAS). The costs of healthcare use were estimated from patient self-reports (Client Service Receipt Inventory). Cost-utility was assessed by using the net-benefit approach and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). RESULTS: On average, the total costs per patient in the CBT group (1,847 euro) were significantly lower than those in patients receiving RPT (3,664 euro) or TAU (3,124 euro). Patients receiving CBT reported a higher quality of life (QALYs and EQ-VAS scores); the differences between groups were significant only for EQ-VAS. From a complete case-analysis approach (base case), the point estimates of the cost-effectiveness ratios resulted in dominance for the CBT group in all of the comparisons performed, by using both QALYs and EQ-VAS as outcomes. These findings were confirmed by bootstrap analyses, net-benefit curves, and CEACs. Two additional sensitivity analyses (intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis) indicated that the results were robust. The comparison of RPT with TAU yielded no clear preference for either treatment when using QALYs, although RPT was determined to be more cost-effective than TAU when evaluating EQ-VAS. CONCLUSIONS: Because of lower costs, CBT is the most cost-effective treatment for adult FM patients. Implementation in routine medical care would require policymakers to develop more-widespread public access to trained and experienced therapists in group-based forms of CBT.

13000,Cost-utility of cognitive behavioral therapy versus U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended drugs and usual care in the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia: an economic evaluation alongside a 6-month randomized controlled trial,"INTRODUCTION: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-recommended pharmacologic treatments (RPTs; pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran) are effective treatment options for fibromyalgia (FM) syndrome and are currently recommended by clinical guidelines. We compared the cost-utility from the healthcare and societal perspectives of CBT versus RPT (combination of pregabalin + duloxetine) and usual care (TAU) groups in the treatment of FM. METHODS: The economic evaluation was conducted alongside a 6-month, multicenter, randomized, blinded, parallel group, controlled trial. In total, 168 FM patients from 41 general practices in Zaragoza (Spain) were randomized to CBT (n = 57), RPT (n = 56), or TAU (n = 55). The main outcome measures were Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs, assessed by using the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire) and improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQoL, assessed by using EuroQoL-5D visual analogue scale, EQ-VAS). The costs of healthcare use were estimated from patient self-reports (Client Service Receipt Inventory). Cost-utility was assessed by using the net-benefit approach and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs). RESULTS: On average, the total costs per patient in the CBT group (1,847 euro) were significantly lower than those in patients receiving RPT (3,664 euro) or TAU (3,124 euro). Patients receiving CBT reported a higher quality of life (QALYs and EQ-VAS scores); the differences between groups were significant only for EQ-VAS. From a complete case-analysis approach (base case), the point estimates of the cost-effectiveness ratios resulted in dominance for the CBT group in all of the comparisons performed, by using both QALYs and EQ-VAS as outcomes. These findings were confirmed by bootstrap analyses, net-benefit curves, and CEACs. Two additional sensitivity analyses (intention-to-treat analysis and per-protocol analysis) indicated that the results were robust. The comparison of RPT with TAU yielded no clear preference for either treatment when using QALYs, although RPT was determined to be more cost-effective than TAU when evaluating EQ-VAS. CONCLUSIONS: Because of lower costs, CBT is the most cost-effective treatment for adult FM patients. Implementation in routine medical care would require policymakers to develop more-widespread public access to trained and experienced therapists in group-based forms of CBT.
