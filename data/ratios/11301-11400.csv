11301,Cost effectiveness of targeted high-dose atorvastatin therapy following genotype testing in patients with acute coronary syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Results from the PROVE IT trial suggest that patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) treated with atorvastatin 80 mg/day (A80) have significantly lower rates of cardiovascular events compared with patients treated with pravastatin 40 mg/day (P40). In a genetic post hoc substudy of the PROVE IT trial, the rate of event reduction was greater in carriers of the Trp719Arg variant in kinesin family member 6 protein (KIF6) than in noncarriers. We assessed the cost effectiveness of testing for the KIF6 variant followed by targeted statin therapy (KIF6 Testing) versus not testing patients (No Test) and treating them with P40 or A80 in the USA from a payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed in which 2-year event rates from PROVE IT were extrapolated over a lifetime horizon. Costs and utilities were derived from published literature. All costs were in 2010 US dollars except the cost of A80, which was in 2012 US dollars because the generic formulation was available in 2012. Expected costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for each strategy over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: Lifetime costs were US$31,700; US$37,100 and US$41,300 for No Test P40, KIF6 Testing and No Test A80 strategies, respectively. The No Test A80 strategy was associated with more QALYs (9.71) than the KIF6 Testing (9.69) and No Test P40 (9.57) strategies. No Test A80 had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$232,100 per QALY gained compared with KIF6 Testing. KIF6 Testing had an ICER of US$45,300 per QALY compared with No Test P40. CONCLUSIONS: Testing ACS patients for KIF6 carrier status may be a cost-effective strategy at commonly accepted thresholds. Treating all patients with A80 is more expensive than treating patients on the basis of KIF6 results, but the modest gain in QALYs is achieved at a cost/QALY that is generally considered unacceptable compared with the KIF6 Testing strategy. Compared with treating all patients with P40, the KIF6 Testing strategy had an ICER below US$50,000 per QALY. The conclusions from this study are sensitive to the price of generic A80 and the effect on adherence of knowing KIF6 carrier status.

11303,A cost-utility analysis of pregabalin versus venlafaxine XR in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in Portugal,"BACKGROUND: Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry about several events and activities. The estimated 1-year prevalence for adults is around 2% and the lifetime prevalence could reach more than 6%. The disease is associated with reduced quality of life, being comparable to that of major depressive disorder and to chronic illnesses such as diabetes and arthritis, and high consumption of health care resources. METHODS: A previously published patient-level simulation cost-utility model was adapted to the Portuguese context in order to evaluate clinical and economic consequences of using pregabalin in place of venlafaxine XR in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. The model predicts the evolution of 1,000 patients with generalized anxiety disorder, simulating their pathway in weekly cycles over one year treatment. This is done by setting a pre-treatment Hamilton Anxiety Scale score and projecting the weekly impact of the pharmacotherapy on this score. The model uses clinical data from an 8-week flexible dose direct comparison clinical trial between the two drugs; utility values based on a Spanish study; and Portuguese economic data, being the resource consumption obtained via an expert panel. RESULTS: Pregabalin patients benefited from 0.738 quality adjusted life years while those on venlafaxine XR achieved 0.712. Moreover, the number of weeks with no or minimal anxiety symptoms was estimated to be 12.9 for pregabalin and only 3.8 for venlafaxine XR. Those clinical gains were achieved at the expense of an extra 715euro per patient, implying an incremental cost per quality adjusted life year of 27,199euro and an incremental cost per week with no or minimal symptoms of 79euro. Sensitivity analysis shows that results are robust to main assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming a threshold of 30,000euro per quality adjusted life year, pregabalin is cost-effective in comparison with venlafaxine XR in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in Portugal.",2013-01-11207,23587174,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Luis Silva Miguel,2013,11 / 1,8,Yes,23587174,"Luis Silva Miguel; Nuno Silva Miguel; Monica Ines; A cost-utility analysis of pregabalin versus venlafaxine XR in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder in Portugal, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, ; 11(1):1478-7547; 8",QALY,Portugal,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pregabalin (300-600mg/day) vs. Venlafaxine XR (75-225 mg/day),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,27199,Euro,2006,43866.81
11304,Cost-utility analysis of 10- and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines: protection at what price in the Thai context?,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the costs and outcomes of offering the 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in Thailand compared to the current situation of no PCV vaccination. METHODS: Two vaccination schedules were considered: two-dose primary series plus a booster dose (2+1) and three-dose primary series plus a booster dose (3+1). A cost-utility analysis was conducted using a societal perspective. A Markov simulation model was used to estimate the relevant costs and health outcomes for a lifetime horizon. Costs were collected and values were calculated for the year 2010. The results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in Thai Baht (THB) per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, with future costs and outcomes being discounted at 3% per annum. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis using a Monte Carlo simulation were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Under the base case-scenario of 2+1 dose schedule and a five-year protection, without indirect vaccine effects, the ICER for PCV10 and PCV13 were THB 1,368,072 and THB 1,490,305 per QALY gained, respectively. With indirect vaccine effects, the ICER of PCV10 was THB 519,399, and for PCV13 was THB 527,378. The model was sensitive to discount rate, the change in duration of vaccine protection and the incidence of pneumonia for all age groups.

11308,Economic evaluation of vaccination programme of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to the birth cohort in Japan,"Japan is now preparing to incorporate PCV-7 into the national childhood immunisation programme. Our recently published economic evaluation of using PCV-7 to the birth cohort suggests that the cost to gain one QALY is lower than the WHO''s cost-effectiveness criterion for intervention. However, many countries have started to introduce PCV-13 into their national immunisation schedule replacing PCV-7 for preventing pneumococcal diseases among young children. These raise the need to appraise the ''value for money'' of replacing PCV-7 with PCV-13 vaccination programme in Japan. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis with Markov model and calculated incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Our base-case analyses, which assumed both PCVs have no net indirect effect and set the cost of PCV-7/PCV-13 per shot at yen10,000 (US$125)/ yen13,000 (US$163). The results show that in Base-case A (assumed PCV-13 has no additional protection against AOM compared to PCV-7), replacing PCV-7 with PCV-13 will cost yen37,722,901 (US$471,536) or yen35,584,455 (US$444,850) per QALY when the caregiver''s productivity loss is not included or is included, respectively. While in Base-case B (assumed PCV-13 has additional protection against AOM compared to PCV-7), yen343,830 (US$4298) per QALY or more QALY is gained by saving money without or with caregiver''s productivity loss, respectively. We also find that, in Base-case B if cost per PCV-13 shot is equal to or less than that yen17,000, then a PCV-13 vaccination programme offered to the birth cohort in Japan is likely to be a socially acceptable option compared to the current PCV-7 vaccination programme. Furthermore, if cost per PCV-13 shot is equal to or less than yen12,000, replacing PCV-7 with PCV-13 will save money and gain more QALYs. While in Base-case A, the replacement can only be socially acceptable if cost per PCV-13 shot is equal to or less than yen11,000.",2013-01-11212,23588088,Vaccine,Shu-Ling Hoshi,2013,31 / 25,2762-71,Yes,23588088,"Shu-Ling Hoshi; Masahide Kondo; Ichiro Okubo; Economic evaluation of vaccination programme of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to the birth cohort in Japan, Vaccine, ; 31(25):1873-2518; 2762-71",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) vs. Standard/Usual care- 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-7),Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,444850,United States,2012,501459.42
11309,The cost-effectiveness of screening men who have sex with men for rectal chlamydial and gonococcal infection to prevent HIV Infection,"BACKGROUND: Men who have sex with men (MSM) who have a current or recent history of rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infection are at greater risk for HIV than MSM with no history of rectal infection. Screening and treating MSM for rectal CT/GC infection may help reduce any increased biological susceptibility to HIV infection. METHODS: We used 2 versions of a Markov state-transition model to examine the impact and cost-effectiveness of screening MSM for rectal CT/GC infection in San Francisco: a static version that included only the benefits to those screened and a dynamic version that accounted for population-level impacts of screening. HIV prevention through reduced susceptibility to HIV was the only potential benefit of rectal CT/GC screening that we included in our analysis. Parameter values were based on San Francisco program data and the literature. RESULTS: In the base case, the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained through screening MSM for rectal CT/GC infection was $16,300 in the static version of the model. In the dynamic model, the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained was less than $0, meaning that rectal screening was cost-saving. The impact of rectal CT/GC infection on the risk of HIV acquisition was the most influential model parameter. CONCLUSIONS: Although more information is needed regarding the impact of rectal CT/GC screening on HIV incidence, rectal CT/GC screening of MSM can potentially be a cost-effective, scalable intervention targeted to at-risk MSM in certain urban settings such as San Francisco.",2013-01-11213,23588125,Sex Transm Dis,Harrell W Chesson,2013,40 / 5,366-71,No,23588125,"Harrell W Chesson; Kyle T Bernstein; Thomas L Gift; Julia L Marcus; Sharon Pipkin; Charlotte K Kent; The cost-effectiveness of screening men who have sex with men for rectal chlamydial and gonococcal infection to prevent HIV Infection, Sex Transm Dis, ; 40(5):0148-5717; 366-71",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for rectal Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) for HIV prevention vs. None,men who have sex with men,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,16300,United States,2011,18754.5
11310,Cost-utility analysis of cataract surgery in Japan: a probabilistic Markov modeling study,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate with the best available clinical data in Japan the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery through the estimation of the incremental costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. METHODS: A Markov model with a probabilistic cohort analysis was constructed to calculate the incremental costs per QALY gained by cataract surgery in Japan. A 1-year cycle length and a 20-year horizon were applied. Best available evidence in Japan supplied the model with data on the course of cataract surgery. Uncertainty was explored using univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In base case analysis, cataract surgery was associated with incremental costs of Japanese yen ( yen) 551,513 (US$ 6,920) and incremental effectiveness of 3.38 QALYs per one cataract patient. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) was yen 163,331 (US$ 2,049) per QALY. In Monte Carlo simulation, the average patient with cataract surgery accrued 4.65 [95 % confidence interval (CI): 2.75-5.69] more QALYs than patients without surgery, giving an ICER of yen 118,460 (95 % CI: 73,516-207,926) (US$ 1,486) per QALY.

11311,Portfolios of biomedical HIV interventions in South Africa: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Recent clinical trials of male circumcision, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), and a vaginal microbicide gel have shown partial effectiveness at reducing HIV transmission, stimulating interest in implementing portfolios of biomedical prevention programs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of combination biomedical HIV prevention and treatment scale-up in South Africa, given uncertainty in program effectiveness. DESIGN: Dynamic HIV transmission and disease progression model with Monte Carlo simulation and cost-effectiveness analysis. PARTICIPANTS: Men and women aged 15 to 49 years in South Africa. INTERVENTIONS: HIV screening and counseling, antiretroviral therapy (ART), male circumcision, PrEP, microbicide, and select combinations. MAIN MEASURES: HIV incidence, prevalence, discounted costs, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. KEY RESULTS: Providing half of all uninfected persons with PrEP averts 28 % of future HIV infections for $9,000/QALY gained, but the affordability of such a program is questionable. Given limited resources, annual HIV screening and ART utilization by 75 % of eligible infected persons could avert one-third of new HIV infections, for approximately $1,000/QALY gained. Male circumcision is more cost-effective, but disproportionately benefits men. A comprehensive portfolio of expanded screening, ART, male circumcision, microbicides, and PrEP could avert 62 % of new HIV infections, reducing HIV prevalence from a projected 14 % to 10 % after 10 years. This strategy doubles treatment initiation and adds 31 million QALYs to the population.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model to compare eight strategies for the diagnosis of CHD. SETTING: Secondary care out-patients (Cardiology Department). PATIENTS: Patients referred to cardiologists for the further evaluation of symptoms thought to be angina pectoris. INTERVENTIONS: Eight different strategies were considered, including different combinations of exercise treadmill testing (ETT), single-photon emission CT (SPECT), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and coronary angiography (CA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs expressed as UK sterling in 2010-2011 prices and health outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The time horizon was 50 years. RESULTS: Based on the characteristics of patients in the CE-MARC study, only two strategies appear potentially cost-effective for diagnosis of CHD, both including CMR. The choice is between two strategies: one in which CMR follows a positive or inconclusive ETT, followed by CA if CMR is positive or inconclusive (Strategy 3 in the model); and the other where CMR is followed by CA if CMR is positive or inconclusive (Strategy 5 in the model). The more cost-effective of these two rests on the threshold cost per QALY gained below which health systems define an intervention as cost-effective.

The results are robust to various sources of uncertainty although prior likelihood of CHD requiring revascularisation and the rate at which false negative patients are eventually appropriately identified do impact upon the results.

DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a decision analytic model to compare eight strategies for the diagnosis of CHD. SETTING: Secondary care out-patients (Cardiology Department). PATIENTS: Patients referred to cardiologists for the further evaluation of symptoms thought to be angina pectoris. INTERVENTIONS: Eight different strategies were considered, including different combinations of exercise treadmill testing (ETT), single-photon emission CT (SPECT), cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and coronary angiography (CA). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs expressed as UK sterling in 2010-2011 prices and health outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The time horizon was 50 years. RESULTS: Based on the characteristics of patients in the CE-MARC study, only two strategies appear potentially cost-effective for diagnosis of CHD, both including CMR. The choice is between two strategies: one in which CMR follows a positive or inconclusive ETT, followed by CA if CMR is positive or inconclusive (Strategy 3 in the model); and the other where CMR is followed by CA if CMR is positive or inconclusive (Strategy 5 in the model).

11339,A risk adjusted cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative models of nurse involvement in obesity management in primary care,"OBJECTIVE: Controlled evaluations are subject to uncertainty regarding their replication in the real world, particularly around systems of service provision. Using routinely collected data, we undertook a risk adjusted cost-effectiveness (RAC-E) analysis of alternative applied models of primary health care for the management of obese adult patients. Models were based on the reported level of involvement of practice nurses (registered or enrolled nurses working in general practice) in the provision of clinical-based activities. DESIGN AND METHODS: Linked, routinely collected clinical data describing clinical outcomes (weight, BMI, and obesity-related complications) and resource use (primary care, pharmaceutical, and hospital resource use) were collected. Potential confounders were controlled for using propensity weighted regression analyses. RESULTS: Relative to low level involvement of practice nurses in the provision of clinical-based activities to obese patients, high level involvement was associated with lower costs and better outcomes (more patients losing weight, and larger mean reductions in BMI). Excluding hospital costs, high level practice nurse involvement was associated with slightly higher costs. Incrementally, the high level model gets one additional obese patient to lose weight at an additional cost of $6,741, and reduces mean BMI by an additional one point at an additional cost of $563 (upper 95% confidence interval $1,547). CONCLUSION: Converted to quality adjusted life year (QALY) gains, the results provide a strong indication that increased involvement of practice nurses in clinical activities is associated with additional health benefits that are achieved at reasonable additional cost.

In a 3-armed randomized trial, we reported that 2 inexpensive mail-based interventions, one directed at physicians and the other at physicians plus patients, increased 1-year osteoporosis treatment starts by 4% and 6% (respectively) compared with usual care starts of 11%. The cost-effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. METHODS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of interventions compared with usual care was assessed using Markov decision-analytic models. Costs were expressed in 2010 Canadian dollars and long-term effectiveness based on quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained derived from hypothetical model simulations. The perspective was third-party health care payer; the time horizon was lifetime; and the costs and benefits were discounted 3%. RESULTS: The physician intervention cost was $7.12 per patient, whereas the physician plus patient intervention cost was $8.45. Compared with usual care, the economic simulation demonstrated that for every 1000 patients getting the physician intervention, there were 2 fewer fractures, 2 more QALYs gained, and $22,000 saved. Compared with physician intervention, the simulation demonstrated that for every 1000 patients receiving physician plus patient intervention, there was 1 fewer fracture and 1 more QALY gained, with $18,000 saved.

11342,Economic evaluation of therapies for patients suffering from relapsed-refractory multiple myeloma in Greece,"BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy that incurs a substantial economic burden in care management. Since most patients with multiple myeloma eventually relapse or become refractory to current therapies (rrMM), the aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of the combination of lenalidomide-dexamethasone, relative to bortezomib alone, in patients suffering from rrMM in Greece. METHODS: An international discrete event simulation model was locally adapted to estimate differences in overall survival and treatment costs associated with the two alternative treatment options. The efficacy data utilized came from three international trials (MM-009, MM-010, APEX). Quality of life data were extracted from the published literature. Data on resource use and prices came from relevant local sources and referred to 2012. The perspective of the analysis was that of public providers. Total costs for monitoring and administration of therapy to patients, management of adverse events, and cost of medication were captured. A 3.5% discount rate was used for costs and health outcomes. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate probabilistic results with 95% uncertainty intervals (UI) and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. RESULTS: The mean number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was 3.01 (95% UI 2.81-3.20) and 2.22 (95% UI 2.02-2.41) for lenalidomide-dexamethasone and bortezomib, respectively, giving an incremental gain of 0.79 (95% UI 0.49-1.06) QALYs in favor of lenalidomide-dexamethasone. The mean cost of therapy per patient was estimated at euro80;77,670 (95% UI euro80;76,509-euro80;78,900) and euro80;48,928 (95% UI euro80;48,300-euro80;49,556) for lenalidomide-dexamethasone and bortezomib, respectively. The incremental cost per life year gained with lenalidomide-dexamethasone was estimated at euro80;29,415 (95% UI euro80;23,484-euro80;37,583) and the incremental cost per QALY gained at euro80;38,268 (95% UI euro80;27,001-euro80;58,065). The probability of lenalidomide-dexamethasone being a cost-effective therapy option at a threshold three times the per capita income (euro80;60,000 per QALY) was higher than 95%. The results remained constant, without altering the conclusions, under several hypothetical scenarios.

11343,Cost-effectiveness of treating normal tension glaucoma,"PURPOSE: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of treating normal tension glaucoma (NTG). METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic health model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of treating NTG with IOP lowering therapy to prevent progressive visual field loss. Transitional probabilities were derived from the Collaborative Normal Tension Glaucoma Study and cost data obtained from the literature and the Medicare fee schedule. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of treating all patients with NTG and treating selected individuals with risk factors for disease progression were determined using Monte Carlo simulation. Sensitivity analyses were performed by varying the cost of consultations, medications, laser/surgery, and adjusting utility loss from progressed states. RESULTS: The ICER of treating all patients with NTG over a 10-year period was United States (US) $34,225 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The ICER would be reduced when treatment was offered selectively to those with risk factors for disease progression. The ICER for treating NTG patients with disc hemorrhage, migraine, and those who were female were US $24,350, US $25,533, and US $27,000 per QALY, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of treating all NTG patients in this model was sensitive to cost fluctuation of medications, choice of utility score associated with disease progression, and insensitive to cost of consultations and laser/surgery. CONCLUSIONS: It is cost-effective, in the long-term, to offer IOP lowering therapy, aiming for a 30% reduction from the baseline, to all NTG patients.

11347,Cost-effectiveness of hepatic resection versus percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for early hepatocellular carcinoma,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Both hepatic resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are considered curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but their economic impact still remains not determined. Aim of the present study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness (CE) of these two strategies in early stage HCC (Milan criteria). METHODS: As first step, a meta-analysis of the pertinent literature of the last decade was performed. Seventeen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: 3996 patients underwent resection and 4424 underwent RFA for early HCC. Data obtained from the meta-analysis were used to construct a Markov model. Costs were assessed from the health care provider perspective. A Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to estimate outcomes with distribution samples of 1000 patients for each treatment arm. RESULTS: In a 10-year perspective, for very early HCC (single nodule <2 cm) in Child-Pugh class A patients, RFA provided similar life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy at a lower cost than resection and was the most cost-effective therapeutic strategy. For single HCCs of 3-5 cm, resection provided better life-expectancy and was more cost-effective than RFA, at a willingness-to-pay above euro4200 per quality-adjusted life-year. In the presence of two or three nodules </=3 cm, life-expectancy and quality-adjusted life-expectancy were very similar between the two treatments, but cost-effectiveness was again in favour of RFA. CONCLUSIONS: For very early HCC and in the presence of two or three nodules </=3 cm, RFA is more cost-effective than resection; for single larger early stage HCCs, surgical resection remains the best strategy to adopt as a result of better survival rates at an acceptable increase in cost.",2013-01-11240,23603669,J Hepatol,Alessandro Cucchetti,2013,59 / 2,300-7,No,23603669,"Alessandro Cucchetti; Fabio Piscaglia; Matteo Cescon; Antonio Colecchia; Giorgio Ercolani; Luigi Bolondi; Antonio D Pinna; Cost-effectiveness of hepatic resection versus percutaneous radiofrequency ablation for early hepatocellular carcinoma, J Hepatol, ; 59(2):0168-8278; 300-7",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Hepatic resection vs. percutaneous radiofrequency ablation,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,14046.67,Euro,2012,20360.76
11348,The cost-effectiveness of total laparoscopic hysterectomy compared to total abdominal hysterectomy for the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To summarise how costs and health benefits will change with the adoption of total laparoscopic hysterectomy compared to total abdominal hysterectomy for the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness modelling using the information from a randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: Two hypothetical modelled cohorts of 1000 individuals undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgery costs; hospital bed days used; total healthcare costs; quality-adjusted life years; and net monetary benefits. RESULTS: For 1000 individuals receiving total laparoscopic hysterectomy surgery, the costs were $509 575 higher, 3548 hospital fewer bed days were used and total health services costs were reduced by $3 746 221. There were 39.13 more quality-adjusted life years for a 5 year period following surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The adoption of total laparoscopic hysterectomy is almost certainly a good decision for health services policy makers. There is 100% probability that it will be cost saving to health services, a 86.8% probability that it will increase health benefits and a 99.5% chance that it returns net monetary benefits greater than zero.",2013-01-11241,23604345,BMJ Open,Nicholas Graves,2013,3 / 4,,No,23604345,"Nicholas Graves; Monika Janda; Katharina Merollini; Val Gebski; Andreas Obermair; LACE trial committee; The cost-effectiveness of total laparoscopic hysterectomy compared to total abdominal hysterectomy for the treatment of early stage endometrial cancer, BMJ Open , ; 3(4):2044-6055",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Total laproscopic hysterectomy vs. total adominal hysterectomy,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-93650,Australia,2011,-111334.11
11349,An Italian cost-effectiveness analysis of paclitaxel albumin (nab-paclitaxel) versus conventional paclitaxel for metastatic breast cancer patients: the COSTANza study,"PURPOSE: Paclitaxel albumin (nab-paclitaxel) is a nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel formulation aimed at increasing therapeutic index in metastatic breast cancer. When compared to conventional paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel has a reported longer time to progression, higher response, lower incidence of neutropenia, no need for premedication, shorter time of administration, and in pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients, extended overall survival. This study investigates the cost-effectiveness of nab-paclitaxel versus conventional paclitaxel for pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients in Italy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model with progression-free, progressed, and dead states was developed to estimate costs, outcomes, and quality adjusted life years over 5 years from the Italian National Health Service viewpoint. Patients were assumed to receive nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m(2) three times weekly or conventional paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) three times weekly. Data on health care resource consumption was collected from a convenience sample of five Italian centers. Resources were valued at Euro (euro) 2011. Published utility weights were applied to health states to estimate the impact of response, disease progression, and adverse events on quality adjusted life years. Three sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel gains an extra 0.165 quality adjusted life years (0.265 life years saved) and incurs additional costs of euro2506 per patient treated. This translates to an ICER of euro15,189 (95% confidence interval: euro11,891-euro28,415). One-way sensitivity analysis underscores that ICER for nab-paclitaxel remains stable despite varying taxanes cost. Threshold analysis shows that ICER for nab-paclitaxel exceeds euro40,000 only if cost per mg of conventional paclitaxel is set to zero. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis highlights that nab-paclitaxel has a 0.99 probability to be cost-effective for a threshold value of euro40,000 and is the optimal alternative from a threshold value of euro16,316 onwards. Based on these findings, nab-paclitaxel can be considered highly cost-effective when compared to the acceptability range for ICER proposed by the Italian Health Economics Association (euro25,000-euro40,000).",2013-01-11247,23610525,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Carlo Lazzaro,2013,5 /,125-35,No,23610525,"Carlo Lazzaro; Roberto Bordonaro; Francesco Cognetti; Alessandra Fabi; Sabino De Placido; Grazia Arpino; Paolo Marchetti; Andrea Botticelli; Paolo Pronzato; Elisa Martelli; An Italian cost-effectiveness analysis of paclitaxel albumin (nab-paclitaxel) versus conventional paclitaxel for metastatic breast cancer patients: the COSTANza study, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 5():1178-6981; 125-35",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Paclitaxel albumin vs. Conventional paclitaxel,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,15189,Euro,2011,24319.5
11350,A prospective clinical utility and pharmacoeconomic study of the impact of the 21-gene Recurrence Score(R) assay in oestrogen receptor positive node negative breast cancer,"PURPOSE: The primary purpose of this study was to measure the impact of the 21-gene Recurrence Score(R) result on systemic treatment recommendations and to perform a prospective health economic analysis in stage I-II, node-negative, oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. METHODS: Consenting patients with ER+ node negative invasive breast cancer and their treating medial oncologists were asked to complete questionnaires about treatment preferences, level of confidence in those preferences and a decisional conflict scale (patients only) after a discussion of their diagnosis and risk without knowledge of the Recurrence Score. At a subsequent visit, the assay result and final treatment recommendations were discussed prior to both parties completing a second set of questionnaires. A Markov health state transition model was constructed, simulating the costs and outcomes experienced by a hypothetical ''assay naive'' population and an ''assay informed'' population. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six patients across two cancer centres were enrolled. Of the 150 for whom successful assay results were obtained, physicians changed their chemotherapy recommendations in 45 cases (30%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 22.8-38.0%); either to add (10%; 95% CI 5.7-16.0%) or omit (20%; 95% CI 13.9-27.3%) adjuvant chemotherapy. There was an overall significant improvement in physician confidence post-assay (p<0.001). Patient decisional conflict also significantly decreased following the assay (p<0.001). The simulation model found an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of Canadian Dollars (CAD) $6630/quality-adjusted life years (QALY).

11351,A cost-utility analysis of laparoscopic vs open treatment of colorectal cancer in a public hospital of the Greek National Health System,"PURPOSE: Laparoscopic colectomy has been reported as a safe and oncologically similar operation to open colectomy. A number of expensive surgical instruments are necessary for the procedure which should be applied if it is cost-effective for the patient and the health system in general. The purpose of the current study was the economic evaluation of laparoscopic compared to open colectomy for the treatment of colon cancer in the Greek national health system. METHODS: Fifty patients undergoing open colectomy and 42 undergoing laparoscopic colectomy were enrolled in this case-control study. Length of hospital stay, duration of operation, complication rates, cost of equipment used, total costs and three questionnaires measuring quality of life /QoL (EQ-5D, SF-36 and QLQ-C30) at baseline, 1 and 3 months after the operation were recorded. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference in QoL measured by QALYs between laparoscopic and open colectomy was observed. On the other hand, cost utility analysis revealed that laparoscopic colectomy was more expensive considering the advantages it offers. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colectomy is not superior to open colectomy on a QoL basis in the Greek public hospital system and is less cost-effective compared to the open procedure.

11353,A comparative analysis of models used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus warfarin for the prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: A number of models exploring the cost-effectiveness of dabigatran versus warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation have been published. These studies found dabigatran was generally cost-effective, considering well-accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds, but estimates of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) varied, even in the same setting. The objective of this study was to compare the findings of the published economic models and identify key model features accounting for differences. METHODS: All aspects of the economic evaluations were reviewed: model approach, inputs, and assumptions. A previously published model served as the reference model for comparisons of the selected studies in the US and UK settings. The reference model was adapted, wherever possible, using the inputs and key assumptions from each of the other published studies to determine if results could be reproduced in the reference model. Incremental total costs, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and ICERs (cost per QALY) were compared between each study and the corresponding adapted reference model. The impact of each modified variable or assumption was tracked separately. RESULTS: The selected studies were in the US setting (2), the Canadian setting (1), and the UK setting (2). All models used the Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation study (RE-LY) as the main source for clinical inputs, and all used a Markov modelling approach, except one that used discrete event simulation. The reference model had been published in the Canadian and UK settings. In the UK setting, the reference model reported an ICER of UK pound4,831, whereas the other UK-based analysis reported an ICER of UK pound23,082. When the reference model was modified to use the same population characteristics, cost inputs, and utility inputs, it reproduced the results of the other model (ICER UK pound25,518) reasonably well. Key reasons for the different results between the two models were the assumptions on the event utility decrement and costs associated with intracranial haemorrhage, as well as the costs of warfarin monitoring and disability following events. In the US setting, the reference model produced an ICER similar to the ICER from one of the US models (US$15,115/QALY versus US$12,386/QALY, respectively) when modelling assumptions and input values were transferred into the reference model. Key differences in results could be explained by the population characteristics (age and baseline stroke risk), utility assigned to events and specific treatments, adjustment of stroke and intracranial haemorrhage risk over time, and treatment discontinuation and switching. The reference model was able to replicate the QALY results, but not the cost results, reported by the other US cost-effectiveness analysis. The parameters driving the QALY results were utility values by disability levels as well as utilities assigned to specific treatments, and event and background mortality rates.

11355,Cost-effectiveness of injectable disease-modifying therapies for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis in Spain,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of injectable disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the first-line treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in Spain. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intramuscular interferon beta-1a (IM IFNbeta-1a), subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (SC IFNbeta-1a), interferon beta-1b (IFNbeta-1b) and glatiramer acetate (GA) relative to best supportive care in a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 RRMS patients in Spain. The model was developed from a societal perspective with a time horizon of 30 years. Natural history and clinical trial data were used to model relapse rates and disease progression. Cost and utility data were obtained from a published survey of multiple sclerosis patients in Spain. The primary outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared to best supportive care, the base case cost-effectiveness was <euro>168,629 per QALY gained for IM IFNbeta-1a, <euro>231,853 per QALY gained for IFNbeta-1b, <euro>295,638 per QALY gained for SC IFNbeta-1a, and <euro>318,818 per QALY gained for GA.

11359,Cost-utility analysis of duloxetine in osteoarthritis: a US private payer perspective,"BACKGROUND: Duloxetine has recently been approved in the USA for chronic musculoskeletal pain, including osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain. The cost effectiveness of duloxetine in osteoarthritis has not previously been assessed. Duloxetine is targeted as post first-line (after acetaminophen) treatment of moderate to severe pain. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of osteoarthritis from a US private payer perspective compared with other post first-line oral treatments, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and both strong and weak opioids. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a discrete-state, time-dependent semi-Markov model based on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) model documented in its 2008 osteoarthritis guidelines. The model was extended for opioids by adding titration, discontinuation and additional adverse events (AEs). A life-long time horizon was adopted to capture the full consequences of NSAID-induced AEs. Fourteen health states comprised the structure of the model: treatment without persistent AE, six during-AE states, six post-AE states and death. Treatment-specific utilities were calculated using the transfer-to-utility method and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total scores from a meta-analysis of osteoarthritis clinical trials of 12 weeks and longer. Costs for 2011 were estimated using Red Book, The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality''s Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database, the literature and, sparingly, expert opinion. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken, as well as subgroup analyses of patients over 65 years old and a population at greater risk of NSAID-related AEs. RESULTS: In the base case the model estimated naproxen to be the lowest total-cost treatment, tapentadol the highest cost, and duloxetine the most effective after considering AEs. Duloxetine accumulated 0.027 discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) more than naproxen and 0.013 more than oxycodone. Celecoxib was dominated by naproxen, tramadol was subject to extended dominance, and strong opioids were dominated by duloxetine. The model estimated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$47,678 per QALY for duloxetine versus naproxen. One-way sensitivity analysis identified the probabilities of NSAID-related cardiovascular AEs as the inputs to which the ICER was most sensitive when duloxetine was compared with an NSAID. When compared with a strong opioid, duloxetine dominated the opioid under nearly all sensitivity analysis scenarios. When compared with tramadol, the ICER was most sensitive to the costs of duloxetine and tramadol. In subgroup analysis, the cost per QALY for duloxetine versus naproxen fell to US$24,125 for patients over 65 years and to US$18,472 for a population at high risk of cardiovascular and gastrointestinal AEs.

11363,Lopinavir/ritonavir versus darunavir plus ritonavir for HIV infection: a cost-effectiveness analysis for the United States,"BACKGROUND: The ARTEMIS trial compared first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) to darunavir plus ritonavir (DRV + RTV) for HIV-1-infected subjects. In order to fully assess the implications of this study, economic modelling extrapolating over a longer term is required. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to simulate the course of HIV and its management, including the multiple factors known to be of importance in ART. METHODS: A comprehensive discrete event simulation was created to represent, as realistically as possible, ART management and HIV outcomes. The model was focused on patients for whom clinicians believed that LPV/r or DRV + RTV were good options as a first regimen. Prognosis was determined by the impact of initial treatment on baseline CD4+ T-cell count and viral load, adherence, virological suppression/failure/rebound, acquired resistance mutations, and ensuing treatment changes. Inputs were taken from trial data (ARTEMIS), literature and, where necessary, stated assumptions. Clinical measures included AIDS events, side effects, time on sequential therapies, cardiovascular events, and expected life-years lost as a result of HIV infection. The model underwent face, technical and partial predictive validation. Treatment-naive individuals similar to those in the ARTEMIS trial were modelled over a lifetime, and outcomes with first-line DRV + RTV were compared with those with LPV/r, both paired with tenofovir and emtricitabine. Up to three regimen changes were permitted. Drug prices were based on wholesale acquisition cost. Outcomes were lifetime healthcare costs (in 2011 US dollars) from the US healthcare system perspective and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (discounted at 3 % per annum). RESULTS: Choice of LPV/r over DRV + RTV as initial ART resulted in nearly identical clinical outcomes, but distinctly different economic consequences. Starting with an LPV/r regimen potentially results in approximately US$25,000 discounted lifetime savings. Accumulated QALYs for LPV/r and DRV + RTV were 12.130 and 12.083, respectively (a 19-day difference). In sensitivity analyses, net monetary benefit ranged from US$12,000 to US$31,000, favouring LPV/r (base case US$27,762). CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive simulation of lifetime course of HIV in the USA indicated that using LPV/r as first-line therapy compared with DRV + RTV may result in cost savings, with similar clinical outcomes.",2013-01-11266,23620210,Pharmacoeconomics,Kit N Simpson,2013,31 / 5,427-44,Yes,23620210,"Kit N Simpson; Pamela P Pei; Jorgen Moller; Robert W Baran; Birgitta Dietz; William Woodward; Kristen Migliaccio-Walle; J Jaime Caro; Lopinavir/ritonavir versus darunavir plus ritonavir for HIV infection: a cost-effectiveness analysis for the United States, Pharmacoeconomics, ; 31(5):1179-2027; 427-44",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lopinavir/ritonavir + Tenofovir/emtricitabine (LPV/r+TRV) vs. Darunavir + ritonavir + Tenofovir/emtricitabine (DRV+RTV+TRV),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 5, 10 years",3.00,3.00,-528895.83,United States,2011,-608538.58
11364,Boceprevir for previously untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C Genotype 1 infection: a US-based cost-effectiveness modeling study,"BACKGROUND: SPRINT-2 demonstrated that boceprevir (BOC), an oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 3 (NS3) protease inhibitor, added to peginterferon alfa-2b (P) and ribavirin (R) significantly increased sustained virologic response rates over PR alone in previously untreated adult patients with chronic HCV genotype 1. We estimated the long-term impact of triple therapy vs. dual therapy on the clinical burden of HCV and performed a cost-effectiveness evaluation. METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the incidence of liver complications, discounted costs (2010 US$), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of three treatment strategies for treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1. The model simulates the treatment regimens studied in SPRINT-2 in which PR was administered for 4 weeks followed by: 1) placebo plus PR for 44 weeks (PR48); 2) BOC plus PR using response guided therapy (BOC/RGT); and 3) BOC plus PR for 44 weeks (BOC/PR48) and makes projections within and beyond the trial. HCV-related state-transition probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from previously published studies. All costs and QALYs were discounted at 3%. RESULTS: The model projected approximately 38% and 43% relative reductions in the lifetime incidence of liver complications in the BOC/RGT and BOC/PR48 regimens compared with PR48, respectively. Treatment with BOC/RGT is associated with an incremental cost of $10,348 and an increase of 0.62 QALYs compared to treatment with PR48. Treatment with BOC/PR48 is associated with an incremental cost of $35,727 and an increase of 0.65 QALYs compared to treatment with PR48. The ICERs were $16,792/QALY and $55,162/QALY for the boceprevir-based treatment groups compared with PR48, respectively. The ICER for BOC/PR48 compared with BOC/RGT was $807,804. CONCLUSION: The boceprevir-based regimens used in the SPRINT-2 trial were projected to substantially reduce the lifetime incidence of liver complications and increase the QALYs in treatment-naive patients with hepatitis C genotype 1.

11368,Treatment of type 2 diabetes with saxagliptin: a pharmacoeconomic evaluation in Argentina,"BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of diabetes and its inadequate management results in a heavy burden of the disease for the patients, the health and the productive system and the overall community. Consequently, it is necessary to have new effective drugs to treat people with diabetes to decrease such burden. DPP-4 inhibitors can help to cope with this demand, but its usage is challenged by its apparent high cost. The aim of the current study was to compare a simulated cost-effectiveness ratio of metformin (MET) plus one drug of the DPP-4 inhibitors family, saxagliptin (SAXA) or sulfonylurea (SU) treatment during a 20-year period, from the perspective of the social security system, in a cohort of people with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) who did not attain glycosylated hemoglobin treatment target values only with MET. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model (Cardiff diabetes model) based on UKPDS 68 was used to simulate disease progression and to estimate the economic and health treatment consequences in people with T2DM. The clinical efficacy parameters for SAXA administration were obtained from the literature; local standard costs were considered for drug acquisition, adverse events (AEs), and micro/macrovascular complications. Costs were expressed in US dollars (2009) with an annual 3.5% discount and a 20-year time horizon. RESULTS: The SAXA + MET treated group had a lower number of non-fatal events than the SU + MET treated group. The model also predicted a lower number of fatal macrovascular events for the SAXA + MET group (149.6 vs. 152.8). The total cost of the SAXA + MET cohort was 15% higher than that of the SU + MET cohort. Treatment with SAXA + MET resulted in a higher number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (9.54 vs. 9.32) and life-years gained (LYGs) (20.84 vs. 20.76) compared to those treated with SU + MET. The incremental cost per QALY and LYG gained was $7,374 and $20,490, respectively.

As a result, RV vaccination programs do not currently exist in most European countries. Hospitalization is the main driver of RV disease costs, and prematurity, low birth weight (LBW) and underlying medical conditions have been associated with RV hospitalization and complications. We investigated the cost-effectiveness of targeted RV vaccination of high-risk infants and universal RV vaccination versus no vaccination. METHODS: Disease burden, mortality and healthcare costs of RV hospitalization for children with and without prematurity, LBW and congenital pathology were quantified in two hospital-based observational studies in the Netherlands. Cost-effectiveness analysis was based on an age-structured stochastic multi-cohort model of the Dutch population comparing universal RV vaccination and targeted vaccination of high-risk infants to no vaccination. The primary endpoint was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with a threshold of euro35,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) from the healthcare provider perspective. Sensitivity analyses included vaccine price and coverage, herd-immunity and QALY losses. RESULTS: A total of 936 children with RV infection were included. Prematurity, LBW and congenital pathology were associated with increased risks of RV hospitalization (relative risks (RR) ranging from 1.6 to 4.4), ICU admission (RR ranging from 4.2 to 7.9), prolonged hospital stay (1.5 to 3.0 excess days) and higher healthcare costs (euro648 to euro1,533 excess costs). Seven children succumbed due to RV complications, all belonging to the high-risk population. Targeted RV vaccination was highly cost-effective and potentially cost-saving from the healthcare provider perspective with ICERs below euro20,000/QALY in all scenarios with total (undiscounted) annual healthcare costs between -euro0.1 and euro0.5 million/year. Results were most sensitive to mortality rates, but targeted vaccination remained highly cost-effective up to reductions of 90% compared to observed mortality. Universal RV vaccination was not considered cost-effective (mean ICER: euro60,200/QALY) unless herd-immunity and caretaker QALY losses were included and vaccine prices were euro60 at most (mean ICER: euro21,309/QALY).

Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of dronedarone from a Canadian health care perspective based on resource utilization and cardiovascular hospitalization or death in ATHENA. METHODS: Data on medical resource utilization (cardiovascular hospitalizations, hospitalization because of treatment-related adverse events, outpatient examinations and procedures, study drug and concomitant medications) were aggregated for all randomized patients during the entire trial period (mean 21 months). Effectiveness was measured using the total number of avoided cardiovascular hospitalizations and deaths from any cause, and projected survival and quality-adjusted survival using life tables adjusted for AF mortality and data on determinants of utility in AF. We used standard unit costs from Canada (2008), discounting costs and effects at 5% per year. RESULTS: Patients receiving dronedarone incurred a mean total cost (undiscounted) of CAD $7402 during the trial period, compared with CAD $6708 for patients receiving placebo. The cost of dronedarone was partly offset by savings for cardiovascular hospitalizations and concomitant medications. On average, patients taking dronedarone experienced 0.18 fewer events (cardiovascular hospitalizations or death). The cost per event avoided was CAD $3807, the cost per life-year gained was CAD $5204, and the cost per quality-adjusted life-years was CAD $7560. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with generally accepted thresholds, our results indicate that treatment with dronedarone as in ATHENA is cost-effective.",2013-01-11278,23623647,Can J Cardiol,Jenny Berg,2013,29 / 10,,No,23623647,"Jenny Berg; Luc Sauriol; Stuart Connolly; Peter Lindgren; Cost-effectiveness of dronedarone in patients with atrial fibrillation in the ATHENA trial, Can J Cardiol, 2013 Oct; 29(10):0828-282X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dronedarone vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,7560,Canada,2008,8580.25
11376,The cost-effectiveness of oral direct factor Xa inhibitors compared with low-molecular-weight heparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in total hip or knee replacement surgery,"INTRODUCTION: Major orthopedic surgery is associated with a high risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Anticoagulants are recommended to prevent VTE, and recently an oral direct factor Xa inhibitor (FXaI) was approved for this indication. We compared the cost-effectiveness of FXaIs with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) or total knee replacement (TKR) surgery. DESIGN: A decision-tree model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of oral direct FXaIs (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) to subcutaneous LMWHs (enoxaparin and dalteparin), with separate models for THR and TKR. The analysis was conducted over a 180-day postoperative time horizon from the U.S. Medicare perspective. The model was developed using TreeAge Pro 2011 (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown, MA, USA). METHODS: Efficacy and safety data (probabilities of distal and proximal deep vein thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism, and major bleeding) were derived from a systematic review and meta-analysis of phase II and III clinical trials. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) are reported. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: In the THR model, the average costs per patient for FXaIs and LMWHs were $18,762 and $18,897, respectively, and the QALYs were 0.938 and 0.932. In the TKR model, the average cost per patient for FXaIs and LMWHs were $18,804 and $18,991, respectively, and the QALYs were 0.935 and 0.931. In both models, FXaIs dominated LMWH (less costly and more efficacious). Neither model was sensitive to changes in any of the variables in the one-way sensitivity analyses. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that FXaIs were cost-effective in more than 99% of iterations in the THR population and in 98% of iterations in the TKR population assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY.

11378,"A comparison of acellular dermal matrix to autologous dermal flaps in single-stage, implant-based immediate breast reconstruction: a cost-effectiveness analysis","BACKGROUND: The use of acellular dermal matrix has allowed for single-stage immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy at a significantly decreased cost compared with two-stage expander/implant reconstruction. The use of a pedicled autologous dermal flap in the same fashion as acellular dermal matrix in women with larger, ptotic breasts has also allowed for single-stage immediate breast reconstruction with similarly low complication rates and without the added procedural cost of using acellular dermal matrix. There have been no prior studies evaluating whether the added procedural cost for acellular dermal matrix is cost-effective relative to using an autologous dermal flap in single-stage immediate breast reconstruction following mastectomy. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify published complication rates for single-stage, implant-based immediate breast reconstruction using either acellular dermal matrix or an autologous dermal flap. The probabilities of the most common complications were combined with Medicare Current Procedural Terminology reimbursement codes and expert utility estimates to fit into a decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of acellular dermal matrix. RESULTS: : The decision model revealed a baseline cost difference of $261.72 and a 0.001 increase in the quality-adjusted life years when using acellular dermal matrix, yielding an incremental cost-utility ratio of $261,720 per quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis showed that acellular dermal matrix was not cost-effective when the complication rate for autologous dermal flaps was below 20 percent.

11379,A comparison of free autologous breast reconstruction with and without the use of laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved technology used to assess tissue viability and perfusion. Its use in plastic and reconstructive surgery to assess flap perfusion in autologous breast reconstruction is relatively new. There have been no previous studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of this new technology compared with the current practice of clinical judgment in evaluating tissue perfusion and viability in free autologous breast reconstruction in patients who have undergone mastectomy. METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify the complication rate of the most common complications with and without laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography in free autologous breast reconstruction after mastectomy. These probabilities were combined with Medicare Current Procedural Terminology provider reimbursement codes (cost) and utility estimates for common complications from a survey of 10 plastic surgeons to fit into a decision model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography. RESULTS: The decision model revealed a baseline cost difference of $773.66 and a 0.22 difference in the quality-adjusted life-years, yielding an incremental cost-utility ratio of $3516.64 per quality-adjusted life year favoring laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography. Sensitivity analysis showed that using laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography was more cost-effective when the complication rate without using laser-assisted indocyanine green angiography (clinical judgment alone) was 4 percent or higher.

11380,Cost-effectiveness of exercise therapy after corticosteroid injection for moderate to severe shoulder pain due to subacromial impingement syndrome: a trial-based analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-effectiveness analysis of subacromial corticosteroid injection combined with exercise compared with exercise alone in patients with moderate to severe shoulder pain from subacromial impingement syndrome. METHODS: A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis with 232 patients randomized to physiotherapy-led injection combined with exercise (n = 115) or exercise alone (n = 117). The analysis was from a health care perspective with 24-week follow-up. Resource use information was collected from all patients on interventions, medication, primary and secondary care contacts, private health care use and over-the-counter purchases. The measure of outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), calculated from EQ-5D responses at baseline and three further time points. An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Mean per patient NHS costs ( pound255 vs pound297) and overall health care costs ( pound261 vs pound318) were lower in the injection plus exercise arm, but this difference was not statistically significant. Total QALYs gained were very similar in the two trial arms (0.3514 vs 0.3494 QALYs), although slightly higher in the injection plus exercise arm, indicating that injection plus exercise may be the dominant treatment option. At a willingness to pay of pound20,000 per additional QALY gained, there was a 61% probability that injection plus exercise was the most cost-effective option. CONCLUSION: Injection plus exercise delivered by therapists may be a cost-effective use of resources compared with exercise alone and lead to lower health care costs and less time off work.

The aim of this paper is to review the evidence for the use of lacosamide for adjunctive treatment of refractory focal seizures with or without secondary generalization, within the scope of the 2012 update of the Clinical Guideline published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). METHODS: Clinical evidence for the use of lacosamide and other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was systematically reviewed, evaluated, and presented to the Guideline Development Group. Only randomized clinical trials were included. Outcomes of clinical efficacy (seizure freedom, 50% reduction in seizure frequency, time to first seizure, time to 12-month remission, treatment withdrawal, and time to treatment withdrawal), experience of adverse events, and cognitive and quality of life outcomes were reviewed. A decision model was built to weigh the clinical benefits of each adjunctive AED, measured by seizure control and seizure reduction, compared with the harm from adverse events, as measured by withdrawals from treatment due to adverse events. RESULTS: Lacosamide was included as part of the recommended AEDS to be used in tertiary epilepsy centers. The evidence review showed that more participants who received lacosamide as an adjunctive treatment had at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency compared with those taking placebo. However, more participants on lacosamide were found to experience adverse events and withdrawal from treatment compared with those on placebo. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that compared with placebo, the benefits gained from adjunctive lacosamide were modest and uncertain, whereas the costs were significantly high.

The aim of this paper is to review the evidence for the use of lacosamide for adjunctive treatment of refractory focal seizures with or without secondary generalization, within the scope of the 2012 update of the Clinical Guideline published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). METHODS: Clinical evidence for the use of lacosamide and other antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) was systematically reviewed, evaluated, and presented to the Guideline Development Group. Only randomized clinical trials were included. Outcomes of clinical efficacy (seizure freedom, 50% reduction in seizure frequency, time to first seizure, time to 12-month remission, treatment withdrawal, and time to treatment withdrawal), experience of adverse events, and cognitive and quality of life outcomes were reviewed. A decision model was built to weigh the clinical benefits of each adjunctive AED, measured by seizure control and seizure reduction, compared with the harm from adverse events, as measured by withdrawals from treatment due to adverse events. RESULTS: Lacosamide was included as part of the recommended AEDS to be used in tertiary epilepsy centers. The evidence review showed that more participants who received lacosamide as an adjunctive treatment had at least a 50% reduction in seizure frequency compared with those taking placebo. However, more participants on lacosamide were found to experience adverse events and withdrawal from treatment compared with those on placebo. The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that compared with placebo, the benefits gained from adjunctive lacosamide were modest and uncertain, whereas the costs were significantly high.

DESIGN: A Markov decision model simulating follow-up over a 36-month period. Published data were used to estimate values for the model, including costs (measured in 2011 U.S. dollars), utilities (measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)), and probabilities. SETTING: Decision analysis simulation from a societal perspective. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of community-dwelling women and men aged 65 to 80. MEASUREMENTS: Net monetary benefit (NMB) was calculated by subtracting the incremental cost of the strategy from the product of incremental QALYs and willingness-to-pay threshold. A higher NMB indicates greater cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: In women aged 65 to 80, population screening was slightly more cost-effective than universal supplementation, with an incremental NMB of $224 compared with $189 (P < .001). Population screening in men was also more cost-effective than universal supplementation (incremental NMB $298 vs $260, P < .001). Results differed according to age group. In those aged 65, population screening had cost-effectiveness similar to that of universal supplementation in women ($59 vs $71) and men ($114 vs $120), whereas in those aged 80, population screening was substantially more cost-effective than universal supplementation in women ($563 vs $428) and men ($703 vs $571).

11397,Cost-effectiveness of universal and platelet reactivity assay-driven antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome,"Assays monitoring P2Y12 platelet reactivity can accurately predict which patients will have a poor response to clopidogrel. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of using platelet reactivity assays (PRAs) to select a dual-antiplatelet regimen for patients with acute coronary syndrome. A hybrid decision tree Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of universal clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel (given to all patients) or PRA-driven ticagrelor or prasugrel (given to patients with high platelet reactivity, defined as >230 on the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay; the others received generic clopidogrel). We assumed a cohort of 65-year-old patients with acute coronary syndrome and an incidence of high platelet reactivity of 32% and 13% at ~24 to 48 hours after revascularization and 1 month, respectively. The 5-year costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for PRA-driven ticagrelor and prasugrel compared with universal clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel. PRA-driven ticagrelor and prasugrel were cost-effective compared with universal clopidogrel (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $40,100 and $49,143/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively); however, universal ticagrelor and prasugrel were not (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $61,651 and $96,261/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively). Monte Carlo simulation suggested PRA-driven ticagrelor, PRA-driven prasugrel, universal ticagrelor, and universal prasugrel would have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year in 52%, 40%, 23%, and 2% of the iterations compared with universal clopidogrel, respectively.

11399,Cost-effectiveness of universal and platelet reactivity assay-driven antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome,"Assays monitoring P2Y12 platelet reactivity can accurately predict which patients will have a poor response to clopidogrel. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of using platelet reactivity assays (PRAs) to select a dual-antiplatelet regimen for patients with acute coronary syndrome. A hybrid decision tree Markov model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of universal clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel (given to all patients) or PRA-driven ticagrelor or prasugrel (given to patients with high platelet reactivity, defined as >230 on the VerifyNow P2Y12 assay; the others received generic clopidogrel). We assumed a cohort of 65-year-old patients with acute coronary syndrome and an incidence of high platelet reactivity of 32% and 13% at ~24 to 48 hours after revascularization and 1 month, respectively. The 5-year costs, quality-adjusted life-years, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for PRA-driven ticagrelor and prasugrel compared with universal clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel. PRA-driven ticagrelor and prasugrel were cost-effective compared with universal clopidogrel (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $40,100 and $49,143/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively); however, universal ticagrelor and prasugrel were not (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $61,651 and $96,261/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively). Monte Carlo simulation suggested PRA-driven ticagrelor, PRA-driven prasugrel, universal ticagrelor, and universal prasugrel would have an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$50,000/quality-adjusted life-year in 52%, 40%, 23%, and 2% of the iterations compared with universal clopidogrel, respectively.
