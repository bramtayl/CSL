34001,Cost effectiveness of therapist delivered cognitive behavioural therapy and web-based self-management in irritable bowel syndrome: the ACTIB randomised trial.,"BACKGROUND: Telephone therapist delivered CBT (TCBT) and web-based CBT (WCBT) have been shown to be significantly more clinically effective than treatment as usual (TAU) at reducing IBS symptom severity and impact at 12 months in adults with refractory IBS. In this paper we assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions. METHODS: Participants were recruited from 74 general practices and three gastroenterology centres in England. Interventions costs were calculated, and other service use and lost employment measured and costed for one-year post randomisation. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were combined with costs to determine cost-effectiveness of TCBT and WCBT compared to TAU. RESULTS: TCBT cost £956 more than TAU (95% CI, £601-£1435) and generated 0.0429 more QALYs. WCBT cost £224 more than TAU (95% CI, - £11 to £448) and produced 0.029 more QALYs. Compared to TAU, TCBT had an incremental cost per QALY of £22,284 while the figure for WCBT was £7724. After multiple imputation these ratios increased to £27,436 and £17,388 respectively. Including lost employment and informal care, TCBT had costs that were on average £866 lower than TAU (95% CI, - £1133 to £2957), and WCBT had costs that were £1028 lower than TAU (95% CI, - £448 to £2580). CONCLUSIONS: TCBT and WCBT resulted in more QALYs and higher costs than TAU. Complete case analysis suggests both therapies are cost-effective from a healthcare perspective. Imputation for missing data reduces cost-effectiveness but WCTB remained cost-effective. If the reduced societal costs are included both interventions are likely to be more cost-effective.

34009,Cost-effectiveness analysis of home-based rehabilitation compared to usual care for people with inoperable lung cancer.,"OBJECTIVE: Few economic evaluations of lung cancer rehabilitation exist. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of providing home-based rehabilitation for inoperable lung cancer. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of rehabilitation compared with usual care. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER (95% CI)] and the net monetary benefit are reported. Value of information (VOI) analysis assessed the need/value of more research. RESULTS: Seventy participants (34 intervention and 36 usual care), average (SD) age 63.0 (12.0) years, 32 (45.7%) stage IV. The average intervention cost was AU$3421 (AU$5352 usual care), and effect (QALY) was 0.30 (0.31 usual care). The ICER was AU$228,197 (-1,173,194 to 1,101,450) per QALY gained. The net monetary benefit was AU$1508, favouring the intervention. The probability that the intervention was more cost-effective than usual care, at a willingness to pay threshold of AU$50,000, was 75%. VOI analysis showed that additional research to resolve decision uncertainty is potentially worthwhile. CONCLUSION: A high degree of uncertainty exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of lung cancer rehabilitation. Further RCTs, powered for economic evaluations and utilising rehabilitation sensitive outcomes, are required to support translation of evidence into clinical practice.",2021-01-41695,34396615,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),Lara Edbrooke,2021,30 / 6,e13501,No,34396615,"Lara Edbrooke; Linda Denehy; Cameron Patrick; Haitham Tuffaha; Cost-effectiveness analysis of home-based rehabilitation compared to usual care for people with inoperable lung cancer., Eur J Cancer Care (Engl), 2021 Nov; 30(6):; e13501",QALY,Australia,Malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs,"Health Education or Behavior, Other",home-based rehabilitation vs. usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"6 Months, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,193076,Australia,2019,142298.48
34044,Cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture prevention intervention for Medicare beneficiaries.,"BACKGROUND: Secondary fracture prevention intervention such as fracture liaison services are effective for increasing osteoporosis treatment rates, but are not currently widely used in the United States. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture prevention intervention after osteoporotic fracture for Medicare beneficiaries. METHODS: An individual-level state-transition microsimulation model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of secondary fracture prevention intervention compared with usual care for U.S. Medicare patients aged 65 and older who experience a new osteoporotic fracture. Patients who initiated pharmacotherapy and remained adherent were assumed to be treated for 5 years. Outcome measures included subsequent fractures, average lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in 2020 U.S. dollars per QALY gained. The model time horizon was lifetime, and analysis perspective was payer. RESULTS: Base-case analysis results showed that the secondary fracture prevention intervention strategy was both more effective and less expensive than usual care-thus, it was cost-saving. Model findings indicated that the intervention would reduce the number of expected fractures by approximately 5% over a 5-year period, preventing approximately 30,000 fractures for 1 million patients. Secondary fracture prevention intervention resulted in an average cost savings of $418 and an increase in QALYs of 0.0299 per patient over the lifetime; for 1 million patients who receive the intervention instead of usual care, expected cost savings for Medicare would be $418 million dollars. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses supported base-case findings of cost savings. CONCLUSION: Secondary fracture prevention intervention for Medicare beneficiaries after a new osteoporotic fracture is very likely to both improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs compared with usual care.

34045,Economic outcomes of depression screening after acute coronary syndromes: The CODIACS-QoL randomized clinical trial.,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening for depression in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and no history of depression. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomized trial enrolling 1500 patients with ACS between 2013 and 2017. Patients were randomized to no screening, screening and notifying the primary care provider (PCP), and screening, notifying the PCP, and providing enhanced depression treatment. Outcomes measured were Healthcare utilization, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: 7.1% of patients screened positive for depressive symptoms. There was no significant difference in usage of mental health services, cardiovascular tests and procedures, and medications. Mean total costs in No Screen group ($7440), in Screen, Notify, and Treat group ($6745), and in Screen and Notify group ($6204). The difference was only significant in the Screen and Notify group versus the No Screen group (-$1236, 95% confidence interval -$2388 to -$96). Because mean QALYs were higher (+0.003 QALY in Screen and Notify; +0.004 QALYs in Screen, Notify, and Treat) and mean total costs were lower in both intervention groups, these interventions were cost-effective.

34047,Cost-Effectiveness of Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Guided Thrombolysis for Patients With Stroke With Unknown Time of Onset.,"OBJECTIVES: Patients waking up with stroke symptoms are often excluded from intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase (IV-tpa). The WAKE-UP trial, a European multicenter randomized controlled trial, proved the clinical effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging-guided IV-tpa for these patients. This analysis aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared to placebo. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to analyze the cost-effectiveness over a 25-year time horizon. The model consisted of an inpatient acute care phase and a rest-of-life phase. Health states were defined by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Initial transition probabilities to mRS scores were based on WAKE-UP data and health state utilities on literature search. Costs were based on data from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, literature, and expert opinion. Incremental costs and effects over the patients' lifetime were estimated. The analysis was conducted from a formal German healthcare perspective. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Treatment with IV-tpa resulted in cost savings of €51 009 and 1.30 incremental gains in quality-adjusted life-years at a 5% discount rate. Univariate sensitivity analysis revealed incremental cost-effectiveness ratio being sensitive to the relative risk of favorable outcome on mRS for placebo patients after stroke, the costs of long-term care for patients with mRS 4, and patient age at initial stroke event. In all cases, IV-tpa remained cost-effective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis proved IV-tpa cost-effective in >95% of the simulations results.

34048,Post-Transplant Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance: A Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Utility Analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: Assess cost-effectiveness and -utility associated with post-transplant HCC surveillance compared to standard follow-up. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Despite lack of prospective clinical data, expert consensus recommends post-transplant surveillance to detect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) recurrence in a latent phase, while it might be amenable to curative-intent therapy. METHODS: A Markov-based transition model was created to estimate life expectancy and quality-of-life among liver transplant patients undergoing HCC surveillance. Models were built for two cohorts: one undergoing HCC surveillance with contrast-enhanced CT of chest and abdomen and serum alpha-fetoprotein analysis and the other receiving standard post-transplant follow-up. Primary model outputs included life-year (LY) and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gains, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). Willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a QALY gain (cost-effectiveness threshold) was used to estimate efficiency. RESULTS: Surveillance was marginally more effective versus no surveillance, resulting in means of 0.069 LYs and 0.026 QALYs gained. Costs for surveillance were increased by an average of 988.32[Euro sign], resulting in ICER 14,410.15[Euro sign]/LY and ICUR 37,547.97[Euro sign]/QALY. Surveillance did not appear cost-effective in our setting, considering WTP threshold of 25,000[Euro sign]/QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated surveillance might be cost-effective in 42% of cases, but degree of uncertainty in the analysis was high. CONCLUSIONS: Performing post-transplant HCC surveillance offers marginal clinical benefits and increases costs. While expert consensus supports surveillance, results of this decision analysis raise doubt regarding the utility of such recommendations and support ongoing need for prospective clinical trials.",2021-01-41681,34928553,Ann Surg,Amelia Hessheimer,2021,/,,No,34928553,"Amelia Hessheimer; Vargas-Martinez, Ana Magdalena; Marta Trapero-Bertran; Miquel Navasa; Constantino Fondevila; Post-Transplant Hepatocellular Carcinoma Surveillance: A Cost-Effectiveness and Cost-Utility Analysis., Ann Surg, 2021 Nov 11; ():",QALY,Spain,Malignant neoplasms of digestive organs,Diagnostic,post liver transplant hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance vs. standard post liver transplant follow-up (no surveillance),"good post-transplant liver allograft function at entry, people with hepatocellular carcinoma who had received a liver transplant",55 Years,55 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,37547.97,Euro,2020,44902.26
34049,Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses of dengue vaccination in Indonesia.,"Despite the fact that the incidence and mortality rates due to dengue virus (DENV) infection in Indonesia are relatively high, dengue vaccination has not yet been introduced. This study aimed to analyse the cost-effectiveness and the budget impact of dengue vaccination in Indonesia by taking the potential of pre-vaccination screening into account. An age-structured decision tree model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness value by applying a single cohort of 4,710,100 children that was followed-up in a 10-year time horizon within a 1-year analytical cycle. The budget impact was analysed in a 5-year period (2020-2024) by considering provinces' readiness to introduce dengue vaccine and their incidence rate of DENV infection in the last 10 years. Vaccination that was coupled with pre-vaccination screening would reduce dengue fever (DF), dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) by 188,142, 148,089 and 426 cases, respectively. It would save treatment cost at $23,433,695 and $14,091,642 from the healthcare and payer perspective, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) would be $5,733 and $5,791 per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) gained from both perspectives. The most influential parameters affecting the ICERs were probability of DENV infection, vaccine efficacy, under-reporting factor, vaccine price, case fatality rate and screening cost.

34053,Cost-Effectiveness of Hypertension Treatment by Pharmacists in Black Barbershops.,"BACKGROUND: In LABBPS (Los Angeles Barbershop Blood Pressure Study), pharmacist-led hypertension care in Los Angeles County Black-owned barbershops significantly improved blood pressure control in non-Hispanic Black men with uncontrolled hypertension at baseline. In this analysis, 10-year health outcomes and health care costs of 1 year of the LABBPS intervention versus control are projected. METHODS: A discrete event simulation of hypertension care processes projected blood pressure, medication-related adverse events, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease events, and noncardiovascular disease death in LABBPS participants. Program costs, total direct health care costs (2019 US dollars), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated for the LABBPS intervention and control arms from a health care sector perspective over a 10-year horizon. Future costs and QALYs were discounted 3% annually. High and intermediate cost-effectiveness thresholds were defined as <$50 000 and <$150 000 per QALY gained, respectively. RESULTS: At 10 years, the intervention was projected to cost an average of $2356 (95% uncertainty interval, -$264 to $4611) more per participant than the control arm and gain 0.06 (95% uncertainty interval, 0.01-0.10) QALYs. The LABBPS intervention was highly cost-effective, with a mean cost of $42 717 per QALY gained (58% probability of being highly and 96% of being at least intermediately cost-effective). Exclusive use of generic drugs improved the cost-effectiveness to $17 162 per QALY gained. The LABBPS intervention would be only intermediately cost-effective if pharmacists were less likely to intensify antihypertensive medications when systolic blood pressure was ≥150 mm Hg or if pharmacist weekly time driving to barbershops increased. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension care delivered by clinical pharmacists in Black barbershops is a highly cost-effective way to improve blood pressure control in Black men.",2021-01-41677,33855861,Circulation,Kelsey Bryant,2021,143 / 24,2384-2394,No,33855861,"Kelsey Bryant; Andrew Moran; Dhruv Kazi; Yiyi Zhang; Joanne Penko; Natalia Ruiz-Negron; Pamela Coxson; Ciantel Blyler; Kathleen Lynch; Laura Cohen; Gabriel Tajeu; Valy Fontil; Norma Moy; Joseph Ebinger; Florian Rader; Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo; Brandon Bellows; Cost-Effectiveness of Hypertension Treatment by Pharmacists in Black Barbershops., Circulation, 2021 Jun 15; 143(24):; 2384-2394",QALY,United States of America,Hypertensive diseases,"Other, Pharmaceutical",hypertension treatment by pharmacists in black barbershops vs. encouragement and hypertension education by barber,"black, systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, individuals requiring dialysis or chemo-therapy were excluded",79 Years,35 Years,Male,Full,"10 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,42717,United States,2019,45275.61
34054,Can Cost-effectiveness Analysis Inform Genotype-Guided Aspirin Use for Primary Colorectal Cancer Prevention?,"BACKGROUND: Inherited genetic variants can modify the cancer-chemopreventive effect of aspirin. We evaluated the clinical and economic value of genotype-guided aspirin use for colorectal cancer chemoprevention in average-risk individuals. METHODS: A decision analytical model compared genotype-guided aspirin use versus no genetic testing, no aspirin. The model simulated 100,000 adults ≥50 years of age with average colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease risk. Low-dose aspirin daily starting at age 50 years was recommended only for those with a genetic test result indicating a greater reduction in colorectal cancer risk with aspirin use. The primary outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The mean cost of using genotype-guided aspirin was $187,109 with 19.922 mean QALYs compared with $186,464 with 19.912 QALYs for no genetic testing, no aspirin. Genotype-guided aspirin yielded an ICER of $66,243 per QALY gained, and was cost-effective in 58% of simulations at the $100,000 willingness-to-pay threshold. Genotype-guided aspirin was associated with 1,461 fewer polyps developed, 510 fewer colorectal cancer cases, and 181 fewer colorectal cancer-related deaths. This strategy prevented 1,078 myocardial infarctions with 1,430 gastrointestinal bleeding events, and 323 intracranial hemorrhage cases compared with no genetic testing, no aspirin. CONCLUSIONS: Genotype-guided aspirin use for colorectal cancer chemoprevention may offer a cost-effective approach for the future management of average-risk individuals. IMPACT: A genotype-guided aspirin strategy may prevent colorectal cancer, colorectal cancer-related deaths, and myocardial infarctions, while minimizing bleeding adverse events. This model establishes a framework for genetically-guided aspirin use for targeted chemoprevention of colorectal cancer with application toward commercial testing in this population.",2021-01-41676,33849967,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,Eman Biltaji,2021,30 / 6,1106-1113,No,33849967,"Eman Biltaji; Brandon Walker; Trang Au; Zachary Rivers; Jennifer Ose; Christopher Li; Diana Brixner; David Stenehjem; Cornelia Ulrich; Can Cost-effectiveness Analysis Inform Genotype-Guided Aspirin Use for Primary Colorectal Cancer Prevention?, Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev, 2021 Jun; 30(6):; 1106-1113",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,"genotype-guided aspirin use for colorectal cancer chemoprevention vs. no genetic testing, no aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer","no previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer, an average colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease risk",Not Stated,50 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,66243,United States,2019,70210.73
34057,Cost-effectiveness of transcarotid artery revascularization versus carotid endarterectomy.,"OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have demonstrated that transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) has comparable outcomes to the surgical gold standard, carotid endarterectomy (CEA). However, few studies have analyzed the cost of TCAR, and no study has evaluated its cost-effectiveness. The purpose of this study is to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing TCAR with CEA for carotid artery stenosis. METHODS: We built a Markov microsimulation using transition probabilities and utilities from existing literature for symptomatic patients undergoing TCAR or CEA. Costs were derived from literature then converted to 2019 dollars. The model included six health states with monthly cycle lengths: surgery, death, alive after surgery, alive after myocardial infarction, alive after stroke, and alive after stroke and death. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were analyzed over a 5-year period. One-way sensitivity and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to study the impact of parameter variability on cost effectiveness. RESULTS: For symptomatic patients, CEA cost $7821 for 2.85 QALYs, whereas TCAR cost $19154 for 2.92 QALYs, leading to an ICER of $152,229 per QALY gained in the TCAR arm. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that our model was most sensitive to probability of restenosis, costs of TCAR, and costs of CEA. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated TCAR would be considered cost-effective in 49% of iterations. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that, although 5-year costs for TCAR were greater than CEA, TCAR afforded greater QALYs than CEA.

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of postmastectomy HFRT vs CFRT based on the NCT00793962 trial. METHODS: A Markov model was adopted to synthesize the medical costs and health benefits of patients with high-risk breast cancer based on data from the NCT00793962 trial. Main outcomes were discounted lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). We employed a time-dependent horizon from Chinese, French and USA payer perspectives. Model robustness was evaluated with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Patients receiving CFRT versus HFRT gained an incremental 0.0163 QALYs, 0.0118 QALYs and 0.0028 QALYs; meanwhile an incremental cost of $2351.92, $4978.34 and $8812.70 from Chinese, French and USA payer perspectives, respectively. Thus CFRT versus HFRT yielded an ICER of $144,281.47, $420,636.10 and $3,187,955.76 per QALY from Chinese, French and USA payer perspectives, respectively. HFRT could maintain a trend of >50% probabilities of cost-effectiveness below a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $178,882.00 in China, while HFRT was dominant relative to CFRT, regardless of the WTP values in France and the USA.

34061,Cost-Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Genetic Testing.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Approximately 3-5% of CRCs are associated with hereditary cancer syndromes. Individuals who harbor germline mutations are at an increased risk of developing early onset CRC, as well as extracolonic tumors. Genetic testing can identify genes that cause these syndromes. Early detection could facilitate the initiation of targeted prevention strategies and surveillance for CRC patients and their families. The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of CRC genetic testing. We utilized a cross-sectional design to determine the cost-effectiveness of CRC genetic testing as compared to the usual screening method (iFOBT) from the provider's perspective. Data on costs and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of 200 CRC patients from three specialist general hospitals were collected. A mixed-methods approach of activity-based costing, top-down costing, and extracted information from a clinical pathway was used to estimate provider costs. Patients and family members' HRQoL were measured using the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. Data from the Malaysian Study on Cancer Survival (MySCan) were used to calculate patient survival. Cost-effectiveness was measured as cost per life-year (LY) and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The provider cost for CRC genetic testing was high as compared to that for the current screening method. The current practice for screening is cost-saving as compared to genetic testing. Using a 10-year survival analysis, the estimated number of LYs gained for CRC patients through genetic testing was 0.92 years, and the number of QALYs gained was 1.53 years. The cost per LY gained and cost per QALY gained were calculated. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) showed that genetic testing dominates iFOBT testing.

34062,Cost-utility analysis of a consensus and evidence-based medication review to optimize and potentially reduce psychotropic drug prescription in institutionalized dementia patients.,"BACKGROUND: Growing evidence shows the effects of psychotropic drugs on the evolution of dementia. Until now, only a few studies have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of psychotropic drugs in institutionalized dementia patients. This study aims to assess the cost-utility of intervention performed in the metropolitan area of Barcelona (Spain) (MN) based on consensus between specialized caregivers involved in the management of dementia patients for optimizing and potentially reducing the prescription of inappropriate psychotropic drugs in this population. This analysis was conducted using the Monitoring and Assessment Framework for the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (MAFEIP) tool. METHODS: The MAFEIP tool builds up from a variety of surrogate endpoints commonly used across different studies in order to estimate health and economic outcomes in terms of incremental changes in quality adjusted life years (QALYs), as well as health and social care utilization. Cost estimates are based on scientific literature and expert opinion; they are direct costs and include medical visits, hospital care, medical tests and exams and drugs administered, among other concepts. The healthcare costs of patients using the intervention were calculated by means of a medication review that compared patients' drug-related costs before, during and after the use of the intervention conducted in MN between 2012 and 2014. The cost-utility analysis was performed from the perspective of a health care system with a time horizon of 12 months. RESULTS: The tool calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the intervention, revealing it to be dominant, or rather, better (more effective) and cheaper than the current (standard) care. The ICER of the intervention was in the lower right quadrant, making it an intervention that is always accepted even with the lowest given Willingness to Pay (WTP) threshold value (€15,000). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study show that the intervention was dominant, or rather, better (more effective) and cheaper than the current (standard) care. This dominant intervention is therefore recommended to interested investors for systematic application.",2021-01-41669,34022809,BMC Geriatr,Mireia Massot Mesquida,2021,21 / 1,327,No,34022809,"Mireia Massot Mesquida; Frans Folkvord; Gemma Seda; Francisco Lupianez-Villanueva; Pere Torán Monserrat; Cost-utility analysis of a consensus and evidence-based medication review to optimize and potentially reduce psychotropic drug prescription in institutionalized dementia patients., BMC Geriatr, 2021 May 22; 21(1):; 327",QALY,Spain,"Organic, including symptomatic, mental disorders",Pharmaceutical,consensus and evidence-based medication review vs. standard of care for dementia,Not Stated,90 Years,65 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"12 Months, Not Stated / None",Not Stated,Not Stated,-26769.11,Euro,2019,-31780.85
34063,Quality-adjusted life year comparison at medium term follow-up of endovascular versus open surgical repair for abdominal aortic aneurysm in young patients.,"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the quality of life and cost effectiveness between endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open surgical repair (OSR) in young patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). DESIGN: This was a single-center, observational, and retrospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with AAA, who were <70 years old and underwent EVAR or OSR between January 2012 and October 2016. Only patients with aortic morphology that was suitable for EVAR were enrolled. Data on the complication rates, medical expenses, and expected quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were collected, and the cost per QALY at three years was compared. RESULTS: Among 90 patients with aortic morphology who were eligible for EVAR, 37 and 53 patients underwent EVAR and OSR, respectively. No significant differences were observed in perioperative cardiovascular events and death between the two groups. However, during the follow-up period, patients undergoing OSR showed a significantly lower complication rate (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.11; P = .021). From the three-year cost-effectiveness analysis, the total sum of costs was significantly lower in the OSR group (P < .001) than that in the EVAR group, and the number of QALYs was superior in the OSR group (P = .013). The cost per QALY at three years was significantly lower in the OSR group than that in the EVAR group (mean: $4038 vs. $10 137; respectively; P < .001).

34064,Is it worth it? Cost-effectiveness analysis of a commercial physical activity app.,"BACKGROUND: Government interest in investing in commercial physical activity apps has increased with little evidence of their cost-effectiveness. This is the first study to our knowledge to examine the cost-effectiveness of a commercial physical activity app (Carrot Rewards) despite there being over 100,000 in the major app stores. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the app compared to a no-intervention reference scenario using a five-year time horizon. Primary data was collected between 2016 and 2017. Data synthesis, model creation, and statistical analyses were conducted between 2019 and 2020. An age-, sex-, and geography-dependent Markov model was developed assuming a public healthcare payer perspective. A closed cohort (n = 38,452) representing the population reached by Carrot Rewards in two Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Newfoundland & Labrador) at the time of a 12-month prospective study was used. Costs and effects were both discounted at 1.5% and expressed in 2015 Canadian dollars. Subgroup analyses were conducted to compare ICERs between provinces, sexes, age groups, and engagement levels. RESULTS: Carrot Rewards had an ICER of $11,113 CAD per quality adjusted life year (QALY), well below a $50,000 CAD per QALY willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Subgroup analyses revealed that the app had lower ICERs for British Columbians, females, highly engaged users, and adults aged 35-64 yrs., and was dominant for older adults (65 + yrs). Deterministic sensitivity analyses revealed that the ICER was most influenced by the relative risk of diabetes. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed varying parameter estimates predominantly resulted in ICERs below the WTP threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The Carrot Rewards app was cost-effective, and dominant for older adults. These results provide, for the first time, rigorous health economic evidence for a commercial physical activity app as part of public health programming.",2021-01-41664,34706689,BMC Public Health,Renante Rondina,2021,21 / 1,1950,No,34706689,"Renante Rondina; Michael Hong; Sisira Sarma; Marc Mitchell; Is it worth it?

34065,Comparative Cost Effectiveness of Reflux-Based and Reflux-Independent Strategies for Barrett's Esophagus Screening.,"INTRODUCTION: Minimally invasive tests for Barrett's esophagus (BE) detection have raised the prospect of broader nonreflux-based testing. Cost-effectiveness studies have largely studied men aged 50 years with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. We evaluated the comparative cost effectiveness of BE screening tests in GERD-based and GERD-independent testing scenarios. METHODS: Markov modeling was performed in 3 scenarios in 50 years old individuals: (i) White men with chronic GERD (GERD-based); (ii) GERD-independent (all races, men and women), BE prevalence 1.6%; and (iii) GERD-independent, BE prevalence 5%. The simulation compared multiple screening strategies with no screening: sedated endoscopy (sEGD), transnasal endoscopy, swallowable esophageal cell collection devices with biomarkers, and exhaled volatile organic compounds. A hypothetical cohort of 500,000 individuals followed for 40 years using a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was simulated. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) comparing each strategy with no screening and comparing screening strategies with each other were calculated. RESULTS: In both GERD-independent scenarios, most non-sEGD BE screening tests were cost effective. Swallowable esophageal cell collection devices with biomarkers were cost effective (<$35,000/QALY) and were the optimal screening tests in all scenarios. Exhaled volatile organic compounds had the highest ICERs in all scenarios. ICERs were low (<$25,000/QALY) for all tests in the GERD-based scenario, and all non-sEGD tests dominated no screening. ICERs were sensitive to BE prevalence and test costs. DISCUSSION: Minimally invasive nonendoscopic tests may make GERD-independent BE screening cost effective.

Cost-effectiveness studies have largely studied men aged 50 years with chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms. We evaluated the comparative cost effectiveness of BE screening tests in GERD-based and GERD-independent testing scenarios. METHODS: Markov modeling was performed in 3 scenarios in 50 years old individuals: (i) White men with chronic GERD (GERD-based); (ii) GERD-independent (all races, men and women), BE prevalence 1.6%; and (iii) GERD-independent, BE prevalence 5%. The simulation compared multiple screening strategies with no screening: sedated endoscopy (sEGD), transnasal endoscopy, swallowable esophageal cell collection devices with biomarkers, and exhaled volatile organic compounds. A hypothetical cohort of 500,000 individuals followed for 40 years using a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was simulated.

RESULTS: In both GERD-independent scenarios, most non-sEGD BE screening tests were cost effective.

In this study, we constructed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of SVd versus Vd in R/R MM. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each treatment strategy from a US payer perspective, using a lifetime horizon and a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Use of SVd was associated with an incremental cost of $170,002 compared to Vd alone ($1,015,120 vs. $845,118, respectively), an incremental effectiveness of 0.35 QALYs (3.43 vs. 3.08 QALYs, respectively), and an ICER of $487,361/QALY.

Objective: To determine the optimal sequence of treatment for patients with NTE MM from the perspective of the patient, physician, and society. Design, setting, and participants: Using data from a Dutch observational registry, this economic evaluation combined evidence from network meta-analyses in a patient-level simulation model and modeled time-to-event and types of events from a hospital perspective with a lifetime horizon. Data analysis was performed from June 2019 to September 2020. Interventions: Thirty treatment sequences, including up to 3 lines of therapy, were compared with bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone (VMP)-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (LenDex)-pomalidomide-dexamethasone (PomDex). Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcomes of the model were overall survival (OS), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and cost-effectiveness. Results: Sequences starting with daratumumab-VMP (second line: carfilzomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone or elotuzumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) or bortezomib-melphalan-prednisone-thalidomide-maintenance bortezomib-thalidomide (VMPT-VT) (second line: daratumumab-lenalidomide-dexamethasone) had the largest expected OS (7.5 years), which is 3.5 additional life-years compared with VMP-LenDex-PomDex. Total costs per patient for these sequences ranged between $786 024 and $1 085 794.
