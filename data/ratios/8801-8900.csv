8801,Cost effectiveness of fibrosis assessment prior to treatment for chronic hepatitis C patients,"Chronic hepatitis C (HCV) is a liver disease affecting over 3 million Americans. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for assessing liver fibrosis and is used as a benchmark for initiating treatment, though it is expensive and carries risks of complications. FibroTest is a non-invasive biomarker assay for fibrosis, proposed as a screening alternative to biopsy.We assessed the cost-effectiveness of FibroTest and liver biopsy used alone or sequentially for six strategies followed by treatment of eligible U.S. patients: FibroTest only; FibroTest with liver biopsy for ambiguous results; FibroTest followed by biopsy to rule in; or to rule out significant fibrosis; biopsy only (recommended practice); and treatment without screening. We developed a Markov model of chronic HCV that tracks fibrosis progression. Outcomes were expressed as expected lifetime costs (2009 USD), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER).Treatment of chronic HCV without fibrosis screening is preferred for both men and women. For genotype 1 patients treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, the ICERs are $5,400/QALY (men) and $6,300/QALY (women) compared to FibroTest only; the ICERs increase to $27,200/QALY (men) and $30,000/QALY (women) with the addition of telaprevir. For genotypes 2 and 3, treatment is more effective and less costly than all alternatives. In clinical settings where testing is required prior to treatment, FibroTest only is more effective and less costly than liver biopsy. These results are robust to multi-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Early treatment of chronic HCV is superior to the other fibrosis screening strategies. In clinical settings where testing is required, FibroTest screening is a cost-effective alternative to liver biopsy.",2011-01-08414,22164204,PLoS One,Shan Liu,2011,6 /,e26783,No,22164204,"Shan Liu; Micha?l Schwarzinger; Fabrice Carrat; Jeremy D Goldhaber-Fiebert; Cost effectiveness of fibrosis assessment prior to treatment for chronic hepatitis C patients, PLoS One , ; 6 ():1932-6203; e26783",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"FibroTest Only- score is less than 0.31 (mild fibrosis, F0–F1) then repeat test annually, if score is between 0.31 and 0.58 (intermediate) then repeat test every six months, score is greater than 0.58 (significant fibrosis, F2–F4) then begin treatment with no liver biopsy vs. FibroTest Rule In- score is less than 0.58 then repeat test annually with no liver biopsy, score is greater than or equal to 0.58, then follow up with liver biopsy",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,21200,United States,2009,25575.04

8819,A pragmatic multi-centre randomised controlled trial of fluid loading in high-risk surgical patients undergoing major elective surgery - the FOCCUS study,"ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Fluid strategies may impact on patient outcomes in major elective surgery. We aimed to study the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pre-operative fluid loading in high-risk surgical patients undergoing major elective surgery. METHODS: This was a pragmatic, non-blinded, multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial. We sought to recruit 128 consecutive high-risk surgical patients undergoing major abdominal surgery. The patients underwent pre-operative fluid loading with 25 ml/kg of Ringer's solution in the six hours before surgery. The control group had no pre-operative fluid loading. The primary outcome was the number of hospital days after surgery with cost-effectiveness as a secondary outcome. RESULTS: A total of 111 patients were recruited within the study time frame in agreement with the funder. The median pre-operative fluid loading volume was 1,875 ml (IQR 1,375 to 2,025) in the fluid group compared to 0 (IQR 0 to 0) in controls with days in hospital after surgery 12.2 (SD 11.5) days compared to 17.4 (SD 20.0) and an adjusted mean difference of 5.5 days (median 2.2 days; 95% CI -0.44 to 11.44; P = 0.07). There was a reduction in adverse events in the fluid intervention group (P = 0.048) and no increase in fluid based complications. The intervention was less costly and more effective (adjusted average cost saving: ?2,047; adjusted average gain in benefit: 0.0431 quality adjusted life year (QALY)) and has a high probability of being cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-operative intravenous fluid loading leads to a non-significant reduction in hospital length of stay after high-risk major surgery and is likely to be cost-effective. Confirmatory work is required to determine whether these effects are reproducible, and to confirm whether this simple intervention could allow more cost-effective delivery of care.

8820,Cost-effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy as a lifesaving rescue procedure for patients with severe traumatic brain injury,"Decompressive craniectomy has been traditionally used as a lifesaving rescue procedure for patients with refractory intracranial hypertension after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its cost-effectiveness remains uncertain.Using data on length of stay in hospital, rehabilitation facility, procedural costs, and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) up to 18 months after surgery, the average total hospital costs per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were calculated for patients who had decompressive craniectomy for TBI between 2004 and 2010 in Western Australia. The Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury prediction model was used to quantify the severity of TBI.Of the 168 patients who had 18-month follow-up data available after the procedure, 70 (42%) achieved a good outcome (GOS-5), 27 (16%) had moderate disability (GOS-4), 34 (20%) had severe disability (GOS-3), 5 (3%) were in vegetative state (GOS-2), and 32 (19%) died (GOS-1). The hospital costs increased with the severity of TBI and peaked when the predicted risk of an unfavorable outcome was about 80%. The average cost per life-year gained (US$671,000 per life-year) and QALY (US$682,000 per QALY) increased substantially and became much more than the usual acceptable cost-effective limit (US$100,000 per QALY) when the predicted risk of an unfavorable outcome was >80%. Changing different underlying assumptions of the analysis did not change the results significantly.Severity of TBI had an important effect on cost-effectiveness of decompressive craniectomy.

8821,The cost-utility of adjuvant chemotherapy using docetaxel and cyclophosphamide compared with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in breast cancer,"The adoption of a chemotherapeutic regimen in oncologic practice is a function of both its clinical and its economic impacts on cancer management. For breast cancer, U.S. Oncology trial 9735 reported significant improvements in disease-free and overall survival favoring adjuvant tc (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles) compared with ac (doxorubicin 60 mg/ m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for 4 cycles). We carried out an economic evaluation to examine the cost-utility of adjuvant tc relative to ac, in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (qaly) gained, given the improved breast cancer outcomes and higher costs associated with the tc regimen.A Markov model was developed to calculate the cumulative costs and qalys gained over a 10-year horizon for hypothetical cohorts of women with breast cancer treated with ac or with tc. Event rates, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature and local resources. Efficacy and adverse events were based on results reported from U.S. Oncology trial 9735. The model takes a third-party direct payer perspective and reports its results in 2008 Canadian dollars. Costs and benefits were both discounted at 3%.At a 10-year horizon, tc was associated with $3,960 incremental costs and a 0.24 qaly gain compared with ac, for a favorable cost-utility of $16,753 per qaly gained.

8834,Screening acute HIV infections among Chinese men who have sex with men from voluntary counseling & testing centers,"Recent studies have shown the public health importance of identifying acute HIV infection (AHI) in the men who have sex with men (MSM) of China, which has a much higher risk of HIV transmission. However, cost-utility analyses to guide policy around AHI screening are lacking.An open prospective cohort was recruited among MSM living in Liaoning Province, Northeast China. Blood samples and epidemiological information were collected every 10 weeks. Third-generation ELISA and rapid test were used for HIV antibody screening, western blot assay (WB) served for assay validation. Antibody negative specimens were tested with 24 mini-pool nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). Specimens with positive ELISA but negative or indeterminate WB results were tested with NAAT individually without mixing. A cost-utility analysis of NAAT screening was assessed. Among the 5,344 follow-up visits of 1,765 MSM in 22 months, HIV antibody tests detected 114 HIV chronic infections, 24 seroconverters and 21 antibody indeterminate cases. 29 acute HIV infections were detected with NAAT from 21 antibody indeterminate and 1,606 antibody negative cases. The HIV-1 prevalence and incidence density were 6.6% (95% CI: 5.5-7.9) and 7.1 (95% CI: 5.4-9.2)/100 person-years, respectively. With pooled NAAT and individual NAAT strategy, the cost of an HIV transmission averted was $1,480. The addition of NAAT after HIV antibody tests had a cost-utility ratio of $3,366 per gained quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The input-output ratio of NAAT was about 1:16.9.The HIV infections among MSM continue to rise at alarming rates. Despite the rising cost, adding pooled NAAT to the HIV antibody screening significantly increases the identification of acute HIV infections in MSM. Early treatment and target-oriented publicity and education programs can be strengthened to decrease the risk of HIV transmission and to save medical resources in the long run.",2011-01-08446,22194914,PLoS One,Xiaoxu Han,2011,6 /,e28792,No,22194914,"Xiaoxu Han; Junjie Xu; Zhenxing Chu; Di Dai; Chunming Lu; Xu Wang; Li Zhao; Cheng Zhang; Yangtao Ji; Hui Zhang; Hong Shang; Screening acute HIV infections among Chinese men who have sex with men from voluntary counseling & testing centers, PLoS One , ; 6 ():1932-6203; e28792",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,HIV screening with ELISA and nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) vs. HIV screening with ELISA,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,3366,United States,2009,4060.64

DESIGN: Decision-analysis model. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was used with information derived from multiple data sources, including meta-analyses and other relevant clinical studies. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The analysis assessed direct medical costs of pneumonia. Strategies were compared on the basis of an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, with effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS: The strategy of having each patient undergo a videofluoroscopic swallowing study for dysphagia was more effective and less costly than the strategies of clinical bedside swallowing evaluation alone or a combined approach. The model was most influenced by the reduction in the risk of pneumonia attributable to the treatment of mild/moderate and severe dysphagia, the effectiveness of treatment with clinical bedside swallowing evaluation, the baseline probability of pneumonia, and the cost of a videofluoroscopic swallowing study.

Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The analysis assessed direct medical costs of pneumonia. Strategies were compared on the basis of an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, with effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS: The strategy of having each patient undergo a videofluoroscopic swallowing study for dysphagia was more effective and less costly than the strategies of clinical bedside swallowing evaluation alone or a combined approach. The model was most influenced by the reduction in the risk of pneumonia attributable to the treatment of mild/moderate and severe dysphagia, the effectiveness of treatment with clinical bedside swallowing evaluation, the baseline probability of pneumonia, and the cost of a videofluoroscopic swallowing study. CONCLUSIONS: A videofluoroscopic swallowing study is cost-effective and often saves costs compared with a clinical bedside swallowing evaluation alone or a combined approach. Research aimed at improving the understanding of the effectiveness of treatment for dysphagia in the prevention of aspiration pneumonia and resulting mortality would improve the model.",2011-01-08447,22197380,PM R,Richard D Wilson,2011,/,,No,22197380,"Richard D Wilson; Evan C Howe; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Screening Methods for Dysphagia After Stroke, PM R, ; ():1934-1482",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dysphagia screening by videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) plus clinical bedside swallow evaluation (CBSE) vs. Dysphagia screening by clinical bedside swallow evaluation (CBSE),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-25000,United States,2010,-29672.54
8838,The cost-effectiveness of exercise referral schemes,"ABSTRACT:Exercise referral schemes (ERS) aim to identify inactive adults in the primary care setting. The primary care professional refers the patient to a third party service, with this service taking responsibility for prescribing and monitoring an exercise programme tailored to the needs of the patient. This paper examines the cost-effectiveness of ERS in promoting physical activity compared with usual care in primary care setting.A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of ERS from a UK NHS perspective. The costs and outcomes of ERS were modelled over the patient's lifetime. Data were derived from a systematic review of the literature on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ERS, and on parameter inputs in the modelling framework. Outcomes were expressed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses investigated the impact of varying ERS cost and effectiveness assumptions. Sub-group analyses explored the cost-effectiveness of ERS in sedentary people with an underlying condition.Compared with usual care, the mean incremental lifetime cost per patient for ERS was ?169 and the mean incremental QALY was 0.008, generating a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for ERS at ?20,876 per QALY in sedentary individuals without a diagnosed medical condition. There was a 51% probability that ERS was cost-effective at ?20,000 per QALY and 88% probability that ERS was cost-effective at ?30,000 per QALY. In sub-group analyses, cost per QALY for ERS in sedentary obese individuals was ?14,618, and in sedentary hypertensives and sedentary individuals with depression the estimated cost per QALY was ?12,834 and ?8,414 respectively. Incremental lifetime costs and benefits associated with ERS were small, reflecting the preventative public health context of the intervention, with this resulting in estimates of cost-effectiveness that are sensitive to variations in the relative risk of becoming physically active and cost of ERS.ERS is associated with modest increase in lifetime costs and benefits.

8842,A cost-benefit analysis of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer,"Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy increases progression-free survival (PFS), but not overall survival when compared to chemotherapy alone in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Recently in November, 2011 the Food and drug administration revoked approval of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of MBC. The European Medicines Agency, in contrast, maintained its approval of bevacizumab in MBC. While neither agency considers health economics in their decision-making process, one of the greatest challenges in oncology practice today is to reconcile hard-won small incremental clinical benefits with exponentially rising costs. To inform policy-makers in the US, this study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab/paclitaxel in MBC, from a payer perspective. We created a decision analytical model using efficacy and adverse events data from the ECOG 2100 trial. Health utilities were derived from available literature. Costs were obtained from the Center for Medicare Services Drug Payment Table and Physician Fee Schedule and are represented in 2010 US dollars. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Bevacizumab added 0.49?years of PFS and 0.135 QALY with an incremental cost of $100,300, and therefore a cost of $204,000 per year of PFS gained and an ICER of $745,000 per QALY. The main drivers of the model were drug acquisition cost, PFS, and health utility values. Using a threshold of $150,000/QALY, drug price would have to be reduced by nearly 80% or alternatively PFS increased by 10?months to make bevacizumab cost-effective. The results of the model were robust in sensitivity analyses. Bevacizumab plus paclitaxel is not cost-effective in treating MBC. Value-based pricing and the development of biomarkers to improve patient selection are needed to better define the role of the drug in this population.",2011-01-08449,22200867,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Alberto J Montero,2012,/,,No,22200867,"Alberto J Montero; Kiran Avancha; Stefan Gl?ck; Gilberto Lopes; A cost-benefit analysis of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer, Breast Cancer Res Treat, ; ():0167-6806",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Paclitaxel/Bezacizumab vs. Paclitaxel alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,608265.44,United States,2010,721951.18
8843,Cost-effectiveness analysis of free vascularized fibular grafting for osteonecrosis of the femoral head,"Management of symptomatic pre-collapse osteonecrosis of the femoral head continues to be controversial. Patients are often young and active, therefore hip-preserving procedures such as free vascularized fibular grafting (FVFG) have been developed to relieve pain and restore function, thereby delaying or preventing the need for joint arthroplasty. This study compared the cost-effectiveness of FVFG to total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the young adult. A Markov decision model was created for a cost-utility analysis of FVFG compared to THA. Outcome probabilities and effectiveness, expressed in QALYs gained, were derived from existing literature. Principal outcome measures included average incremental costs, effectiveness, and net health benefits. Multivariate sensitivity analysis was used to validate the model. THA resulted in a greater average incremental cost (+$5,933) while at a lower average incremental effectiveness (-0.15 QALY) compared to FVFG. On average, THA gained 22.08 QALYs at a cost-effectiveness (C/E) ratio of $1026/QALY, whereas FVFG gained 22.23 QALYs at a C/E ratio of $752/QALY. Threshold sensitivity analysis determined that the yearly all-cause probability of revision for FVFG would have to be more than three times greater than THA before THA became more cost-effective. Free vascularized fibular grafting is a more cost-effective procedure to treat osteonecrosis in certain populations. Markov decision analysis accounts for the impact of treatment strategies over the lifetime of a patient cohort.

8844,Projected cost-savings with herpes simplex virus screening in pregnancy: towards a new screening paradigm,"Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in newborns are an uncommon but potentially devastating consequence of genital HSV infection in women. Current practice focuses on preventing perinatal transmission by women with prevalent HSV, but transmission risk is greatest when genital HSV is acquired for the first time late in pregnancy. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of identifying pregnant women at risk of de novo HSV acquisition as a means of preventing vertical HSV transmission.A Bayesian decision tree model was parameterized using the best available health and economic data relating to HSV in pregnancy and was used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of screening to identify individuals susceptible to HSV infection in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy. Final outcomes were the projected incidence of maternal and neonatal HSV, quality-adjusted life expectancy and life-time costs associated with neonatal HSV.In the absence of testing, model projected incidence of neonatal HSV was 34 cases per 100,000 births, similar to available surveillance data. Screening pregnant women and their partners was projected to decrease the incidence of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections in women and infants and to save costs. These findings were robust under alternative assumptions and in wide-ranging sensitivity analyses.The use of accurate and relatively inexpensive serological tests for HSV to identify women vulnerable to incident HSV infection in pregnancy has the potential to reduce neonatal HSV incidence and reduce health-related costs.",2011-01-10440,21097810,Sex Transm Infect,Ashleigh R Tuite,2011,87 / 2,141-8,No,21097810,"Ashleigh R Tuite; Caitlin J McCabe; Jennifer Ku; David N Fisman; Projected cost-savings with herpes simplex virus screening in pregnancy: towards a new screening paradigm, Sex Transm Infect, ; 87(2):1368-4973; 141-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Serological screening for herpes simplex virus among pregnant women and their partners to identify serodiscordant couples vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-5000,United States,2009,-6031.85

8849,"Cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid in the management of skeletal metastases in patients with lung cancer in France, Germany, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the United kingdom","Zoledronic acid (ZOL) significantly reduces the risk of new skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have bone metastases.The purpose of this study was to assess the cost and cost-effectiveness of ZOL in the management of skeletal metastases in this population across 5 European countries (France, Germany, United Kingdom, Portugal, and the Netherlands) from the perspective of national health care.This cost-effectiveness analysis was based on a subset of patients with NSCLC who were enrolled in a Phase III trial of patients with bone metastases secondary to a variety of solid tumors. In this trial, patients were randomized to receive ZOL or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 21 months. Survival, SRE incidence, and number of infusions administered were derived from the clinical trial. Costs of SREs were estimated using hospital Diagnosis Related Group tariffs and published data.

The Canadian Prevention of Renal and Cardiovascular Endpoints Trial (CanPREVENT) randomized 236 patients to receive usual care (controls) and another 238 patients to multifaceted nurse/nephrologist-supported care that targeted factors associated with development of kidney and cardiovascular disease (intervention). Cost and outcomes over 2 years were examined to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Base-case analysis included disease-related costs, and sensitivity analysis included all costs.Consideration of all costs produced statistically significant differences. A lower number of days in hospital explained most of the cost difference. For both base-case and sensitivity analyses with all costs included, the intervention group required fewer resources and had higher quality of life. The direction of the results was unchanged to inclusion of various types of costs, consideration of payer or societal perspective, changes to the discount rate, and levels of GFR.The nephrologist/nurse-based multifaceted intervention represents good value for money because it reduces costs without reducing quality of life for patients with chronic kidney disease.",2011-01-10511,21617091,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,Robert B Hopkins,2011,6 / 6,1248-57,No,21617091,"Robert B Hopkins; Amit X Garg; Adeera Levin; Anita Molzahn; Claudio Rigatto; Joel Singer; George Soltys; Steven Soroka; Patrick S Parfrey; Brendan J Barrett; Ron Goeree; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomized trial comparing care models for chronic kidney disease, Clin J Am Soc Nephrol, ; 6(6):1555-905X; 1248-57",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nurse-coordinated multirisk factor intervention clinic involving a nephrologist and focusing on applying evidence-based treatments vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,5.00,5.00,-53065.22,Canada,2009,-56356.22

Use of appropriate iron-chelating agents could prevent thalassaemia-related complications, which are costly to the healthcare system. This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of deferoxamine (DFO), deferiprone (DFP) and deferasirox (DFX) in Thai transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia patients from the societal perspective. Methods: A Markov model was used to project the life-time costs and outcomes represented as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Data on the clinical efficacy and safety of all therapeutic options were obtained from a systematic review and clinical trials. Transition probabilities were derived from published studies. Costs were obtained from the Thai Drug and Medical Supply Information Center, Thai national reimbursement rate information and other Thai literature sources. A discount rate of 3% was used. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were presented as year 2009 values. A base-case analysis was performed for thalassaemia patients requiring regular blood transfusion therapy, while a separate analysis was performed for patients requiring low (i.e. symptom-dependent, less frequent) blood transfusion therapy. A series of sensitivity analysis and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed. Results: Compared with DFO, using DFP was dominant with lifetime cost savings of $US91 117. Comparing DFX with DFO, the incremental cost was $US522 863 and incremental QALY was 5.77 with an ICER of $US90 648 per QALY. When compared with DFP, the ICER of DFX was $US106 445 per QALY. A cost-effectiveness analysis curve showed the probability of DFX being cost effective was 0% when compared with either DFO or DFP, based on the cost-effectiveness cut-off value of $US2902 per QALY. When compared with DFP, DFX was cost effective only if the DFX cost was as low as $US1.68 per 250 mg tablet. The results of the analysis in patients requiring low blood transfusion therapy were not different from those of the base-case analysis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that using DFP is cost saving when compared with conventional therapy, while using DFX is not cost effective compared with either DFO or DFP in Thai patients with transfusion-dependent β-thalassaemia.

We compared the economic value from the societal and third-party payer perspectives of the following 4 strategies for a patient hospitalized with influenza-like illness and unable to take oral antiviral agents: Strategy 1: Administration of IV antiviral agents without polymerase chain reaction influenza testing. Strategy 2: Initiation of IV antiviral treatment, followed by polymerase chain reaction testing to determine whether the treatment should be continued. Strategy 3: Performance of polymerase chain reaction testing, followed by initiation of IV antiviral treatment if the test results are positive. Strategy 4: Administration of no IV antiviral agents. Sensitivity analyses varied the probability of having influenza (baseline, 10%; range, 10%-30%), IV antiviral efficacy (baseline, oral oseltamivir phosphate; range, 25%-75%), IV antiviral daily cost (range, $20-$1000), IV antiviral reduction of illness duration (baseline, 1 day; range, 1-2 days), and ventilated vs nonventilated status of the patient.When the cost of IV antiviral agents was no more than $500 per day, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for most of the IV antiviral treatment strategies was less than $10,000 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with no treatment.

The findings were robust to changing risk of influenza, influenza mortality, IV antiviral efficacy, IV antiviral daily cost, IV antiviral reduction of illness duration, and ventilated vs nonventilated status of the patient for both societal and third-party payer perspectives.Our study supports the use of IV antiviral treatment for hospitalized patients with influenza-like illness.",2011-01-10525,21485418,Am J Manag Care,Bruce Y Lee,2011,17 / 1,e1-9,No,21485418,"Bruce Y Lee; Julie H Y Tai; Rachel R Bailey; Sarah M McGlone; Ann E Wiringa; Shanta M Zimmer; Kenneth J Smith; Richard K Zimmerman; Economic model for emergency use authorization of intravenous peramivir, Am J Manag Care, ; 17(1):1096-1860; e1-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intravenous antiviral agents followed by polymerase chain reaction testing vs. Polymerase chain reaction testing followed by intravenous antiviral agents,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,198370,United States,2009,239307.62
8870,Cost-effectiveness of lower extremity compression ultrasound in emergency department patients with a high risk of hemodynamically stable pulmonary embolism,"Computed tomography angiograms (CTAs) for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) are being ordered with increasing frequency from the emergency department (ED). Strategies are needed to safely decrease the utilization of CTs to control rising health care costs and minimize the associated risks of anaphylaxis, contrast-induced nephropathy, and radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The use of compression ultrasonography (US) to identify deep vein thromboses (DVTs) in hemodynamically stable patients with signs and symptoms suggestive of PE is highly specific for the diagnosis of PE and may represent a cost-effective alternative to CT imaging. Objectives: The objective was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of a selective CT strategy incorporating the use of compression US to diagnose and treat DVT in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.The authors constructed a decision analytic model to evaluate the scenario of an otherwise healthy 59-year-old female in whom PE was being considered as a diagnosis. Two strategies were used. The selective CT strategy began with a screening compression US. Negative studies were followed up with a CTA, while patients with positive studies identifying a DVT were treated as though they had a PE and were anticoagulated. The universal CT strategy used CTA as the initial test, and anticoagulation was based on the CT result. Costs were estimated from the 2009 Medicare data for hospital reimbursement, and professional fees were obtained from the 2009 National Physician Fee Schedule. Clinical probabilities were obtained from existing published data, and sensitivity analyses were performed across plausible ranges for all clinical variables.In the base case, the selective CT strategy cost $1,457.70 less than the universal CT strategy and resulted in a gain of 0.0213 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Sensitivity analyses confirm that the selective CT strategy is dominant above both a pretest probability for PE of 8.3% and a compression US specificity of 87.4%.A selective CT strategy using compression US is cost-effective for patients provided they have a high pretest probability of PE. This may reduce the need for, and decrease the adverse events associated with, CTAs.",2011-01-10542,21414059,Acad Emerg Med,Michael J Ward,2011,18 / 1,22-31,No,21414059,"Michael J Ward; Aaron Sodickson; Deborah B Diercks; Ali S Raja; Cost-effectiveness of lower extremity compression ultrasound in emergency department patients with a high risk of hemodynamically stable pulmonary embolism, Acad Emerg Med, ; 18(1):1069-6563; 22-31",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Selective computed tomography strategy vs. Universal computed tomography strategy,Not Stated,59 Years,59 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,3.00,-68436.62,United States,2009,-82559.88

8886,Cost-effectiveness of varenicline and three different behavioral treatment formats for smoking cessation,"There is a lack of evidence of the relative cost-effectiveness of proactive telephone counseling (PTC) and Web-based delivery of smoking cessation services in conjunction with pharmacotherapy. We calculated the differential cost-effectiveness of three behavioral smoking cessation modalities with varenicline treatment in a randomized trial of current smokers from a large health system. Eligible participants were randomized to one of three smoking cessation interventions: Web-based counseling (n=401), PTC (n=402), or combined PTC-Web counseling (n=399). All participants received a standard 12-week course of varenicline. The primary outcome was a 7-day point prevalent nonsmoking at the 6month follow-up. The Web intervention was the least expensive followed by the PTC and PTC-Web groups. Costs per additional 6-month nonsmoker and per additional lifetime quitter were $1,278 and $2,601 for Web, $1,472 and $2,995 for PTC, and $1,617 and $3,291 for PTC-Web.

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of etoricoxib (90?mg) relative to celecoxib (200/400?mg), and the nonselective NSAIDs naproxen (1000?mg) and diclofenac (150?mg) in the initial treatment of ankylosing spondylitis in Norway. Methods. A previously developed Markov state-transition model was used to estimate costs and benefits associated with initiating treatment with the different competing NSAIDs. Efficacy, gastrointestinal and cardiovascular safety, and resource use data were obtained from the literature. Data from different studies were synthesized and translated into direct costs and quality adjusted life years by means of a Bayesian comprehensive decision modeling approach. Results. Over a 30-year time horizon, etoricoxib is associated with about 0.4 more quality adjusted life years than the other interventions. At 1 year, naproxen is the most cost-saving strategy. However, etoricoxib is cost and quality adjusted life year saving relative to celecoxib, as well as diclofenac and naproxen after 5 years of follow-up. For a willingness-to-pay ceiling ratio of 200,000 Norwegian krones per quality adjusted life year, there is a >95% probability that etoricoxib is the most-cost-effective treatment when a time horizon of 5 or more years is considered.

Model input data were based on national statistics, published literature, physician surveys, and Medicare Part B prices.Annual numbers of events were multiplied by quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost and costs to estimate net health and economic impacts of each strategy. Analyses were from a managed care payer perspective for the US population.Patients receiving the assay were predicted to gain 0.127 QALY and save $4359 annually from avoiding chemotherapy, adverse events, supportive care, and secondary primary tumors. For a 2-million member plan, net gains were 4.44 QALYs/year and savings were $13,476/year. Cost savings were greater for the Medicare population. Although overall results were sensitive only to reduced impact of testing and chemotherapy costs, they were still highly cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio <$20,000/QALY).Use of a 21-gene assay in patients with early-stage N (1-3)/ER HER2-negative breast cancer may improve health outcomes and add no incremental cost, thereby providing valuable insight for health plans, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and clinicians regarding coverage policies and treatment decisions.",2011-01-10584,21819166,Am J Manag Care,Burton F Vanderlaan,2011,17 / 7,455-64,No,21819166,"Burton F Vanderlaan; Michael S Broder; Eunice Y Chang; Ruth Oratz; Tanya G K Bentley; Cost-effectiveness of 21-gene assay in node-positive, early-stage breast cancer, Am J Manag Care, ; 17(7):1096-1860; 455-64",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oncotype DX: 21-gene assay in treatment decisions vs. Standard care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,-86.49,United States,2009,-104.33

8897,Comparison of rate control versus rhythm control for management of atrial fibrillation in patients with coexisting heart failure: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"To compare lifetime costs and health outcomes of rate control versus rhythm control for management of atrial fibrillation in patients with coexisting heart failure from the third-party payer perspective.A Markov decision analysis model constructed from costs, utility, and transition probability inputs obtained from randomized clinical trials and publically available databases.A simulated cohort aged 65 years or older with persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and heart failure.Markov states for rhythm control were cardioversion plus amiodarone and maintenance amiodarone, and those for rate control were ?-blocker, digoxin, and calcium channel blocker. Transition states included treatment success, hospitalizations for atrial fibrillation and/or heart failure, and severe adverse effects. Economic inputs included cost for drugs, cost of hospitalizations for atrial fibrillation and/or heart failure, and cost of management of severe adverse effects. Costs were measured in 2009 U.S. dollars, and clinical outcomes in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). One-way and multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted. Uncertainty intervals (UIs) were obtained from probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Rate control was found to be less costly and more effective than rhythm control. Base case and probabilistic sensitivity analyses cost and effectiveness values for rate control were $7231 (95% UI $5517-9016) and 2.395 QALYs (95% UI 2.366-2.424 QALYs); whereas those for rhythm control were $16,291 (95% UI $11,033-21,434) and 2.197 QALYs (95% UI 2.155-2.237 QALYs). No critical values were found for any model parameters in the one-way sensitivity analyses. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curves showed that rate control was considered cost-effective in 100% of cases at willingness-to-pay ratios between $0 and $200,000/QALY.Rate control is less costly and more effective than rhythm control and should be the initial treatment for atrial fibrillation among patients with coexisting heart failure.",2011-01-10596,21923439,Pharmacotherapy,Alexandra Perez,2011,31 / 6,552-65,No,21923439,"Alexandra Perez; Daniel R Touchette; Robert J DiDomenico; Thomas D Stamos; Surrey M Walton; Comparison of rate control versus rhythm control for management of atrial fibrillation in patients with coexisting heart failure: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Pharmacotherapy, ; 31(6):0277-0008; 552-65",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Rate control: beta-blocker, digoxin, and calcium channel blocker vs. Rhythm control: cardioversion plus amiodarone and maintenance amiodarone",Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-45757.57,United States,2009,-55200.56

The scatter plot of ICERs revealed that at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of ?30,000 per QALY gained, the venous conversion method is >95% cost-effective in a midsized department and 51% in a small department.It was concluded that the venous conversion method should be applied to hospitals with midsized pulmonary departments, and could be applied to small pulmonary departments if the WTP is sufficient.",2011-01-10597,21935326,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Lars Oddershede,2011,3 /,1-7,No,21935326,"Lars Oddershede; Sabrina Storgaard Petersen; Asgerd Krogh Kristensen; Jan Freddy Pedersen; Stephen Edward Rees; Lars Ehlers; The cost-effectiveness of venous-converted acid-base and blood gas status in pulmonary medical departments, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 3 ():1178-6981; 1-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Venous converted tests for obtaining arterial blood gas and acid-base status vs. Arterial punctures,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-2583333.25,United Kingdom,2008,-5758843.6
8900,A cost-effectiveness analysis of different therapies in patients with chronic hepatitis B in Italy,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a prevalent disease associated with high morbidity, mortality, and impact on health care costs. Antiviral therapy is aimed at reducing hepatitis B virus replication in order to limit progressive liver disease and improve the natural history of the disease. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, entecavir, tenofovir, and pegylated interferon in patients with CHB.A Markov model was developed to evaluate the costs and benefits of antivirals in a cohort of patients with CHB (hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-positive and HBeAg-negative) and cirrhosis over a period of 10 years. Different rescue therapies were considered, according to current guidelines. Data on efficacy and changes in quality of life were derived from clinical trials and epidemiological Italian data. Direct costs were assessed from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service.Tenofovir was associated with lower costs and higher efficacy compared with entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir, as shown by their incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained: tenofovir ?30,959, entecavir ?45,971, telbivudine ?62,051, and adefovir ?82,824. Even following 1 year of pegylated interferon therapy, tenofovir had a more favourable ICER per QALY gained compared with the other rescue options. The analysis of patients with cirrhosis confirms the results obtained with the CHB cohort though with higher ICERs. Sensitivity analyses on the main variables confirm the results of the base case scenario.Within the Italian health care system, in patients with CHB, tenofovir is a cost-effective strategy compared with other available therapies. Public health care authorities would benefit from mathematical models designed to estimate the future burden of CHB infection together with the impact of treatment and drug resistance.",2011-01-10599,21935331,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Giorgio L Colombo,2011,3 /,37-46,No,21935331,"Giorgio L Colombo; Giovanni B Gaeta; Mauro Vigan?; Sergio Di Matteo; A cost-effectiveness analysis of different therapies in patients with chronic hepatitis B in Italy, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 3 ():1178-6981; 37-46",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lamivudine vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,0.00,45513,Euro,2009,76513.43
