11201,Treatment for life for severe haemophilia A- A cost-utility model for prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment,"Prophylaxis has been established as the treatment of choice in children with haemophilia and its continuation into the adult years has been shown to decrease morbidity throughout life. The cost of factor therapy has made the option questionable in cost-effectiveness studies. The role of prophylaxis in pharmacokinetic dosage and tolerization against inhibitor formation were used to model the cost utility of prophylaxis vs. on-demand (OD) therapy over a lifetime horizon in severe haemophilia A. The model was applied to a single provider national health system exemplified by the United Kingdom''s National Health Service and a third party provider in the United States. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated and compared to threshold values used by payer agencies to guide reimbursement decisions. A cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was also estimated for Sweden. Prophylaxis was dominant over OD treatment in the UK. The model resulted in an ICER - $68 000 - within the range of treatments reimbursed in the USA. In Sweden, a cost/QALY of SEK 1.1 million was also within the range of reimbursed treatments in that country. Dosage- and treatment-induced inhibitor incidence were the most important variables in the model. Subject to continuing clinical evidence of the effectiveness of pharmacokinetic dosage and the role of prophylaxis in decreasing inhibitor incidence, treatment for life with prophylaxis is a cost-effective therapy, using current criteria for the reimbursement of health care technologies in a number of countries.",2013-01-11098,23534877,Haemophilia,A Farrugia,2013,19 / 4,e228-38,No,23534877,"A Farrugia; J Cassar; M C Kimber; M Bansal; K Fischer; G Auserswald; B O'Mahony; K Tolley; D Noone; S Balboni; Treatment for life for severe haemophilia A- A cost-utility model for prophylaxis vs. on-demand treatment, Haemophilia, ; 19(4):1351-8216; e228-38",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylaxis (PRO) vs. On-demand (OD) therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,485082,United States,2011,558127.13

11203,Cost-utility analysis of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel versus paclitaxel in monotherapy in pretreated metastatic breast cancer in Spain,"AIM: The COSTABRAX study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) versus polyethylated castor oil-based standard paclitaxel (sb-paclitaxel) in the treatment of patients with previously treated metastatic breast cancer in Spain. MATERIALS & METHODS: Efficacy data were obtained from the CA012 trial (nab-paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks [q3w] and sb-paclitaxel q3w) and indirect comparison (sb-paclitaxel administered weekly), and were modeled to a time horizon of 5 years using a Markov model. The analysis was performed from the National Health Service perspective. Use of resources and key assumptions of the model were validated by a panel of 22 local oncologists. RESULTS: Compared with sb-paclitaxel q3w, nab-paclitaxel q3w was cost effective, with a cost per life year gained of euro11,088 and a cost per quality-adjusted life year of euro17,808. Compared with sb-paclitaxel administered weekly, it showed savings of euro711 per patient. CONCLUSION: The COSTABRAX study showed that nab-paclitaxel q3w is a cost-effective alternative compared with sb-paclitaxel q3w and a cost-saving alternative to sb-paclitaxel administered weekly in Spain.",2013-01-11099,23534988,Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res,Emilio Alba,2013,13 / 3,381-91,No,23534988,"Emilio Alba; Eva Ciruelos; Rafael Lopez; Jose Manuel Lopez-Vega; Ana Lluch; Miguel Martin; Montserrat Munoz; Pedro Sanchez-Rovira; Miguel Angel Segui; Marta Rubio Liria; Ferran Perez-Alcantara; Cost-utility analysis of nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel versus paclitaxel in monotherapy in pretreated metastatic breast cancer in Spain, Expert Rev Pharmacoecon Outcomes Res, ; 13(3):1744-8379; 381-91",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks vs. polyethylated castor oil-based standard paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks,failed first-line antitumor treatment,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,17808,Euro,2011,28512.85
11204,Economic evaluation of nurse-led intensive care follow-up programmes compared with standard care: the PRaCTICaL trial,"OBJECTIVE: Following intensive care discharge, many patients suffer severe physical and psychological morbidity and a continuing high use of health services. Follow-up programmes have been proposed to improve the outcomes for these patients. We tested the hypothesis that nurse-led intensive care follow-up programmes are cost-effective. METHODS: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled trial of nurse-led intensive care unit follow-up programmes versus standard care. A cost-utility analysis was conducted after 12 months'' follow-up to compare the two interventions. Costs were assessed from the perspective of the UK NHS and outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based upon responses to the EQ-5D administered at baseline, 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 286 patients were recruited to the trial. Total mean cost was pound 5,789 for standard care and pound 7,577 for the discharge clinic. The adjusted difference in means was pound 2,435 [95 % confidence interval (CI) -297 to 5,566]. Mean QALYs were 0.58 for standard care and 0.60 for the discharge clinic. The adjusted mean difference was -0.003 (95 % CI -0.066 to 0.060). If society were willing to pay pound 20,000 per QALY then there would be a 93 % chance that standard care would be considered most efficient. CONCLUSIONS: A nurse-led intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up programme showed no evidence of being cost-effective at 12 months. Further work should focus on evidence-based development of discharge clinic services and current ICU follow-up programmes should review their practice in light of these results.",2013-01-11101,23535984,Eur J Health Econ,R A Hernandez,2014,15 / 3,,Yes,23535984,"R A Hernandez; D Jenkinson; L Vale; B H Cuthbertson; Economic evaluation of nurse-led intensive care follow-up programmes compared with standard care: the PRaCTICaL trial, Eur J Health Econ, 2014 Apr; 15(3):1618-7598",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nurse-led intensive care follow-up programme over a 12-month period vs. Standard/Usual care (no follow up),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,121750,United Kingdom,2010,223085.16

11207,The comparison of trial data-based and registry data-based cost-effectiveness of infliximab treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in Sweden using a modeling approach,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the precision of the predictive cost-effectiveness assessment based on a phase 3 clinical trial with infliximab for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in Swedish clinical practice. METHODS: Three patient cohorts were identified: the patients included in the infliximab trial (ATTRACT), patients initially treated with infliximab from a Swedish registry (STURE), a subset of these registry patients meeting inclusion criteria for the ATTRACT trial was the third patient cohort; two sets of assumptions in relation to the efficacy data were evaluated: ""ATTRACT"" (efficacy data over the duration of the trial) and ""STURE"" (effectiveness data over 10 years). In addition, the impact of including the placebo effect for the comparator was evaluated as a basis for the calculation of cost-effectiveness by using a modeling approach. A health economic model was utilized to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The results for the three patient cohorts ranged from cost saving to a cost per QALY gained of euro2,400 and euro24,900 to euro26,000 when the ATTRACT and STURE assumptions were used, respectively. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the inclusion of placebo effect had the largest effect on the results, increasing the cost per QALY gained to approximately euro50,000 for all patient cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment effect of infliximab measured in clinical trials and clinical practice results in comparable cost-effectiveness ratios, as calculated by using a modeling approach, whereas the assumptions made in relation to the effectiveness data and the chosen comparator have a large impact on the results.

11209,Cost-effectiveness analysis of early versus late total hip replacement in Italy,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of early primary total hip replacement (THR) for functionally independent older adult patients with osteoarthritis (OA) versus 1) nonsurgical therapy followed by THR once the patient has progressed to a functionally dependent state (""delayed THR"") and 2) nonsurgical therapy alone (''medical therapy''), from the Italian National Health Service perspective. METHODS: Individual patient data and evidence from published literature on disease progression, economic costs and THR outcomes in OA, including utilities, perioperative mortality rates, prosthesis survival, and costs of prostheses, THR, rehabilitation, follow-up, revision, and nonsurgical management, combined with population life tables, were synthesized in a Markov model of OA. The model represents the lifetime experience of a patient cohort following their treatment choice, discounting costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life-years) at 3% annually. RESULTS: At age 65 years, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of THR over delayed THR was euro987 in men and euro466 in women; the figures for delayed THR versus medical therapy were euro463 and euro82, respectively. Among 80-year-olds, early THR is (extended) dominant. With gradual utility loss after primary THR, delaying surgery may be more appealing in women than in men in their 50s, because longer female life expectancy implies longer latter periods of low health-related quality of life (HRQOL) with early THR.

METHODS: Individual patient data and evidence from published literature on disease progression, economic costs and THR outcomes in OA, including utilities, perioperative mortality rates, prosthesis survival, and costs of prostheses, THR, rehabilitation, follow-up, revision, and nonsurgical management, combined with population life tables, were synthesized in a Markov model of OA. The model represents the lifetime experience of a patient cohort following their treatment choice, discounting costs and benefits (quality-adjusted life-years) at 3% annually. RESULTS: At age 65 years, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year of THR over delayed THR was euro987 in men and euro466 in women; the figures for delayed THR versus medical therapy were euro463 and euro82, respectively.

METHODS: An ""an area under the curve"" cost-effectiveness model was developed. The clinical effectiveness evidence for both cetuximab and panitumumab was taken from a single randomized controlled trial (RCT) in each case and for cetuximab plus irinotecan from several sources. RESULTS: Patients are predicted to survive for approximately 6 months on BSC, 8.5 months on panitumumab, 10 months on cetuximab, and 16.5 months on cetuximab plus irinotecan. Panitumumab is dominated, and cetuximab is extended dominated. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound95,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was estimated for cetuximab versus BSC and is likely to be relatively accurate, because the relevant clinical evidence is taken from a high-quality RCT.

This new treatment, however, is associated with a higher acquisition cost compared with alternatives. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of fidaxomicin or oral vancomycin for the treatment of CDIs. METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis comparing fidaxomicin with oral vancomycin for the treatment of CDIs in the United States by creating a decision analytic model from the third-party payer perspective. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with fidaxomicin compared with oral vancomycin was $67,576/quality-adjusted life-year. A probabilistic Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis showed that fidaxomicin had an 80.2% chance of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year. Fidaxomicin remained cost-effective under all fluctuations of both fidaxomicin and oral vancomycin costs. The decision analytic model was sensitive to variations in clinical cure and recurrence rates. Secondary analyses revealed that fidaxomicin was cost-effective in patients receiving concominant antimicrobials, in patients with mild to moderate CDIs, and when compared with oral metronidazole in patients with mild to moderate disease.

11232,Cost-effectiveness of a program to eliminate disparities in pneumococcal vaccination rates in elderly minority populations: an exploratory analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Invasive pneumococcal disease is a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States, particularly among the elderly (>65 years). There are large racial disparities in pneumococcal vaccination rates in this population. Here, we estimate the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical national vaccination intervention program designed to eliminate racial disparities in pneumococcal vaccination in the elderly. METHODS: In an exploratory analysis, a Markov decision-analysis model was developed, taking a societal perspective and assuming a 1-year cycle length, 10-year vaccination program duration, and lifetime time horizon. In the base-case analysis, it was conservatively assumed that vaccination program promotion costs were $10 per targeted minority elder per year, regardless of prior vaccination status and resulted in the elderly African American and Hispanic pneumococcal vaccination rate matching the elderly Caucasian vaccination rate (65%) in year 10 of the program. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness of the vaccination program relative to no program was $45,161 per quality-adjusted life-year gained in the base-case analysis. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the likelihood of the vaccination program being cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained was 64% and 100%, respectively.

11233,The cost-effectiveness of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system for the treatment of idiopathic heavy menstrual bleeding in the United States,"OBJECTIVES: Heavy menstrual bleeding negatively impacts the health and quality of life of about 18 million women in the United States. Although some studies have established the clinical effectiveness of heavy menstrual bleeding treatments, few have evaluated their cost-effectiveness. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) compared with other therapies for idiopathic heavy menstrual bleeding. METHODS: We developed a model comparing the clinical and economic outcomes (from a US payer perspective) of three broad initial treatment strategies over 5 years: LNG-IUS, oral agents, or surgery. Up to three nonsurgical treatment lines, followed by up to two surgical lines, were allowed; unintended pregnancy was possible, and women could discontinue any time during nonsurgical treatments. Menstrual blood loss of 80 ml or more per cycle determined treatment failure. RESULTS: Initiating treatment with LNG-IUS resulted in the fewest hysterectomies (6 per 1000 women), the most quality-adjusted life-years (3.78), and the lowest costs ($1137) among all the nonsurgical strategies. Initiating treatment with LNG-IUS was also less costly than surgery, resulted in fewer hysterectomies (vs. 9 per 1000 for ablation) but was associated with fewer quality-adjusted life-years gained per patient (vs. 3.80 and 3.88 for ablation and hysterectomy, respectively). Sensitivity analyses confirmed these results. CONCLUSIONS: LNG-IUS resulted in the lowest treatment costs and the fewest number of hysterectomies performed over 5 years compared with all other initial strategies and resulted in the most quality-adjusted life-years gained among nonsurgical options.

11239,The cost-effectiveness of duloxetine in chronic low back pain: a US private payer perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP) from a US private payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was undertaken for duloxetine and seven oral post-first-line comparators, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), weak and strong opioids, and an anticonvulsant. We created a Markov model on the basis of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence model documented in its 2008 osteoarthritis clinical guidelines. Health states included treatment, death, and 12 states associated with serious adverse events (AEs). We estimated treatment-specific utilities by carrying out a meta-analysis of pain scores from CLBP clinical trials and developing a transfer-to-utility equation using duloxetine CLBP patient-level data. Probabilities of AEs were taken from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence model or estimated from osteoarthritis clinical trials by using a novel maximum-likelihood simulation technique. Costs were gathered from Red Book, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality''s Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database, the literature, and, for a limited number of inputs, expert opinion. The model performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost acceptability curves. RESULTS: The model estimated an ICER of $59,473 for duloxetine over naproxen. ICERs under $30,000 were estimated for duloxetine over non-NSAIDs, with duloxetine dominating all strong opioids. In subpopulations at a higher risk of NSAID-related AEs, the ICER over naproxen was $33,105 or lower.

11240,The cost-effectiveness of duloxetine in chronic low back pain: a US private payer perspective,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of duloxetine in the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP) from a US private payer perspective. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was undertaken for duloxetine and seven oral post-first-line comparators, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), weak and strong opioids, and an anticonvulsant. We created a Markov model on the basis of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence model documented in its 2008 osteoarthritis clinical guidelines. Health states included treatment, death, and 12 states associated with serious adverse events (AEs). We estimated treatment-specific utilities by carrying out a meta-analysis of pain scores from CLBP clinical trials and developing a transfer-to-utility equation using duloxetine CLBP patient-level data. Probabilities of AEs were taken from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence model or estimated from osteoarthritis clinical trials by using a novel maximum-likelihood simulation technique. Costs were gathered from Red Book, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality''s Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project database, the literature, and, for a limited number of inputs, expert opinion. The model performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses and generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost acceptability curves. RESULTS: The model estimated an ICER of $59,473 for duloxetine over naproxen. ICERs under $30,000 were estimated for duloxetine over non-NSAIDs, with duloxetine dominating all strong opioids. In subpopulations at a higher risk of NSAID-related AEs, the ICER over naproxen was $33,105 or lower.

11246,The cost-effectiveness of a novel SIAscopic diagnostic aid for the management of pigmented skin lesions in primary care: a decision-analytic model,"OBJECTIVES: Pigmented skin lesions are commonly presented in primary care. Appropriate diagnosis and management is challenging because the vast majority are benign. The MoleMate system is a handheld SIAscopy scanner integrated with a primary care diagnostic algorithm aimed at improving the management of pigmented skin lesions in primary care. METHODS: This decision-model-based economic evaluation draws on the results of a randomized controlled trial of the MoleMate system versus best practice (ISRCTN79932379) to estimate the expected long-term cost and health gain of diagnosis with the MoleMate system versus best practice in an English primary care setting. The model combines trial results with data from the wider literature to inform long-term prognosis, health state utilities, and cost. RESULTS: Results are reported as mean and incremental cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and value of information analysis. Over a lifetime horizon, the MoleMate system is expected to cost an extra pound18 over best practice alone, and yield an extra 0.01 QALYs per patient examined. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is pound1,896 per QALY gained, with a 66.1% probability of being below pound30,000 per QALY gained. The expected value of perfect information is pound43.1 million. CONCLUSIONS: Given typical thresholds in the United Kingdom ( pound20,000- pound30,000 per QALY), the MoleMate system may be cost-effective compared with best practice diagnosis alone in a primary care setting. However, there is considerable decision uncertainty, driven particularly by the sensitivity and specificity of MoleMate versus best practice, and the risk of disease progression in undiagnosed melanoma; future research should focus on reducing uncertainty in these parameters.",2013-01-11112,23538188,Value Health,Edward C F Wilson,2013,16 / 2,356-66,Yes,23538188,"Edward C F Wilson; Jon D Emery; Ann Louise Kinmonth; A Toby Prevost; Helen C Morris; Elka Humphrys; Per N Hall; Nigel Burrows; Lucy Bradshaw; Joe Walls; Paul Norris; Margaret Johnson; Fiona M Walter; The cost-effectiveness of a novel SIAscopic diagnostic aid for the management of pigmented skin lesions in primary care: a decision-analytic model, Value Health, ; 16(2):1098-3015; 356-66",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Mole Mate system- novel diagnostic aid comprising a handheld SIAscopy scanner incorporating an algorithm developed for use in primarycare vs. Standard/Usual care- best practice (recommended by NICE),Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,1896,United Kingdom,2011,3499.79

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of cardiac screening for HIV-positive men at intermediate or greater CAD risk. DESIGN: We developed a lifetime microsimulation model of CAD incidence and progression in HIV-infected men. METHODS: Input parameters were derived from two HIV cohort studies and the literature. We compared no CAD screening with stress testing and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-based strategies. Patients with test results indicating 3-vessel/left main CAD underwent invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and received coronary artery bypass graft surgery. In the stress testing + medication and CCTA + medication strategies, patients with 1-2-vessel CAD results received lifetime medical treatment without further diagnostics whereas in the stress testing + intervention and CCTA + intervention strategies, patients with these results underwent ICA and received percutaneous coronary intervention. RESULTS: Compared to no screening, the stress testing + medication, stress testing + intervention, CCTA + medication, and CCTA + intervention strategies resulted in 14, 11, 19, and 14 quality-adjusted life days per patient and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 49,261, 57,817, 34,887 and 56,518 Euros per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), respectively.

11251,Health benefits and cost-effectiveness of a hybrid screening strategy for colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines recommend screening schedules for each single type of test except for concurrent sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood test (FOBT). We investigated the cost-effectiveness of a hybrid screening strategy that was based on a fecal immunological test (FIT) and colonoscopy. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis by using the Archimedes Model to evaluate the effects of different CRC screening strategies on health outcomes and costs related to CRC in a population that represents members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The Archimedes Model is a large-scale simulation of human physiology, diseases, interventions, and health care systems. The CRC submodel in the Archimedes Model was derived from public databases, published epidemiologic studies, and clinical trials. RESULTS: A hybrid screening strategy led to substantial reductions in CRC incidence and mortality, gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and reductions in costs, comparable with those of the best single-test strategies. Screening by annual FIT of patients 50-65 years old and then a single colonoscopy when they were 66 years old (FIT/COLOx1) reduced CRC incidence by 72% and gained 110 QALYs for every 1000 people during a period of 30 years, compared with no screening. Compared with annual FIT, FIT/COLOx1 gained 1400 QALYs/100,000 persons at an incremental cost of $9700/QALY gained and required 55% fewer FITs. Compared with FIT/COLOx1, colonoscopy at 10-year intervals gained 500 QALYs/100,000 at an incremental cost of $35,100/QALY gained but required 37% more colonoscopies.

CONCLUSIONS: In our simulation model, a strategy of annual or biennial FIT, beginning when patients are 50 years old, with a single colonoscopy when they are 66 years old, delivers clinical and economic outcomes similar to those of CRC screening by single-modality strategies, with a favorable impact on resources demand.",2013-01-11123,23542330,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,Tuan Dinh,2013,11 / 9,,No,23542330,"Tuan Dinh; Uri Ladabaum; Peter Alperin; Cindy Caldwell; Robert Smith; Theodore R Levin; Health benefits and cost-effectiveness of a hybrid screening strategy for colorectal cancer, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2013 Sep; 11(9):1542-3565",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Annual fecal immunological test (FIT)/annual fecal immunological test and colonoscopy at age 66 (COLOx1) for colorectal cancer vs. Fecal immunological test (FIT),Not Stated,Not Stated,51 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,9700,United States,2010,11512.94

We investigated the cost-effectiveness of a hybrid screening strategy that was based on a fecal immunological test (FIT) and colonoscopy. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis by using the Archimedes Model to evaluate the effects of different CRC screening strategies on health outcomes and costs related to CRC in a population that represents members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The Archimedes Model is a large-scale simulation of human physiology, diseases, interventions, and health care systems. The CRC submodel in the Archimedes Model was derived from public databases, published epidemiologic studies, and clinical trials. RESULTS: A hybrid screening strategy led to substantial reductions in CRC incidence and mortality, gains in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and reductions in costs, comparable with those of the best single-test strategies. Screening by annual FIT of patients 50-65 years old and then a single colonoscopy when they were 66 years old (FIT/COLOx1) reduced CRC incidence by 72% and gained 110 QALYs for every 1000 people during a period of 30 years, compared with no screening.

11270,Lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis of ticagrelor in patients with acute coronary syndromes based on the PLATO trial: a Singapore healthcare perspective,"INTRODUCTION: Ticagrelor is a novel antiplatelet drug developed to reduce atherothrombosis. The PLATO trial compared ticagrelor and aspirin to clopidogrel and aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Ticagrelor was found to be superior in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke, without increasing major bleeding events. The current study estimates the lifetime cost-effectiveness of ticagrelor relative to generic clopidogrel from a Singapore public healthcare perspective. METHODS: This study used a two-part cost-effectiveness model. The first part was a 12-month decision tree (using PLATO trial data) to estimate the rates of major cardiovascular events, healthcare costs and health-related quality of life. The second part was a Markov model estimating lifetime quality-adjusted survival and costs conditional on events during the initial 12 months. Daily drug costs applied were SGD 1.05 (generic clopidogrel) and SGD 6.00 (ticagrelor). Cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was estimated from a Singapore public healthcare perspective using life tables and short-term costs from Singapore, and long-term costs from South Korea. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Ticagrelor was associated with a lifetime QALY gain of 0.13, primarily driven by lower mortality. The resulting incremental cost per QALY gained was SGD 10,136.00. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that ticagrelor had a > 99% probability of being cost-effective, given the lower recommended WHO willingness-to-pay threshold of one GDP/capita per QALY. CONCLUSION: Based on PLATO trial data, one-year treatment with ticagrelor versus generic clopidogrel in patients with ACS, relative to WHO reference standards, is cost-effective from a Singapore public healthcare perspective.",2013-01-11128,23546032,Singapore Med J,Chee Tang Chin,2013,54 / 3,169-75,No,23546032,"Chee Tang Chin; Carl Mellstrom; Terrance Siang Jin Chua; David Bruce Matchar; Lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis of ticagrelor in patients with acute coronary syndromes based on the PLATO trial: a Singapore healthcare perspective, Singapore Med J, ; 54(3):0037-5675; 169-75",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ticagrelor vs. Clopidogrel,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,10136,Singapore,2011,9287.13
11271,Economic appraisal of dabigatran as first-line therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Dabigatran is an oral anticoagulant direct thrombin inhibitor recently registered in South Africa (SA) to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Owing to the price disparity between warfarin (the current gold standard for treatment of patients with AF) and dabigatran, we conducted an economic appraisal of the use of dabigatran compared with warfarin from a payer perspective in the South African private healthcare setting. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness (CE) and budget impact of dabigatran compared with warfarin for the prevention of stroke in AF patients. Methods. A previously published Markov model was populated with SA cost and mortality data to estimate the CE and budget impact analysis of dabigatran over a lifetime horizon. The model population consisted of a cohort of patients of whom those aged younger than 80 years used dabigatran 150 mg twice daily and those older than 80 years 110 mg twice daily. Modelled outcomes included total cost, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental CE ratio (ICER), with the effectiveness measured by QALYs gained. RESULTS: Dabigatran compared with warfarin as first-line treatment was estimated to have an ICER of R93 290 and an average incremental cost per beneficiary per month of R0.39 over a 5-year period. Conservative assumptions were made regarding the number of international normalised ratio monitoring tests for patients on warfarin, and the ICER is estimated to decrease by as much as 15.7% under less stringent assumptions. A robust sensitivity analysis was also performed. CONCLUSION: Dabigatran as first-line treatment compared with warfarin for the use of stroke prevention in patients with AF is deemed cost-effective when used in accordance with its registered indication in the SA private sector.",2013-01-11132,23547700,S Afr Med J,M Bergh,2013,103 / 4,241-5,No,23547700,"M Bergh; C A Marais; H Miller-Janson; F Salie; M P Stander; Economic appraisal of dabigatran as first-line therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, S Afr Med J, ; 103(4):0256-9574; 241-5",QALY,South Africa,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dabigatran vs. warfarin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,93290,South Africa,2012,12851.12
11272,"Cost-effectiveness of apixaban, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation by using novel oral anticoagulants apixaban 5 mg, dabigatran 150 mg, and rivaroxaban 20 mg compared with warfarin. METHODS: A Markov decision-analysis model was constructed using data from clinical trials to evaluate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years of novel oral anticoagulants compared with warfarin. The modeled population was a hypothetical cohort of 70-year-old patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, increased risk for stroke (CHADS2 >/= 1), renal creatinine clearance >/= 50 mL/min, and no previous contraindications to anticoagulation. The willingness-to-pay threshold was $50 000/quality-adjusted life-years gained. RESULTS: In the base case, warfarin had the lowest cost of $77 813 (SD, $2223), followed by rivaroxaban 20 mg ($78 738 +/- $1852), dabigatran 150 mg ($82 719 +/- $1959), and apixaban 5 mg ($85 326 +/- $1512). Apixaban 5 mg had the highest quality-adjusted life-years estimate at 8.47 (SD, 0.06), followed by dabigatran 150 mg (8.41 +/- 0.07), rivaroxaban 20 mg (8.26 +/- 0.06), and warfarin (7.97 +/- 0.04).

During this period, PSUR reporting resulted in the detection of 2 out of a total of 24 urgent safety issues for biologicals: (i) distant spread of botulinum toxin and (ii) edema/fluid collection associated with off-label use of dibotermin-alfa. We used Markov-chain life tables to calculate costs and health effects of PSURs.

METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was developed to estimate (1) total life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and costs for patients treated with sevelamer or calcium carbonate; and (2) incremental costs per LY gained (LYG) and per QALY gained for sevelamer vs calcium carbonate. Data informing probability transitions to all-cause death and dialysis inception in CKD-ND patients were taken directly from the INDEPENDENT-CKD study and were extrapolated beyond the 3-year clinical trial using Weibull regression analysis. Estimates of health utility and costs (in pound2011) were derived from the published literature. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, sevelamer treatment resulted in a gain of 2.05 LYs and 1.56 QALYs per patient, an increase of pound37,282 in total costs per patient vs calcium carbonate (3.5% discount), and a per-patient cost of pound18,193/LYG and pound23,878/QALY gained. Results were robust to alternative assumptions in key parameters; results were most sensitive to alternative assumptions regarding the mean daily dose of sevelamer, impact of sevelamer on dialysis initiation, cost of dialysis, and health utility estimates. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that sevelamer was cost-effective vs calcium carbonate in 93% of simulations at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30,000/QALY gained. LIMITATIONS: While the model simulated a real-world clinical setting, this analysis was subject to limitations common to all decision analytic models, in that it used a mix of data sources and relied on several assumptions.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed with CRT + OMT (CRT-ON) versus OMT only (CRT-OFF) based on a retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis. Raw data was derived from literature and expert opinion, reflecting clinical and economic consequences of patient''s management in Spain. Time horizon was 10 years. Both costs (euro 2010) and effects were discounted at 3 percent per annum. RESULTS: CRT-ON showed higher total costs than CRT-OFF; however, CRT reduced the length of hospitalization in ICU by 94 percent (0.006 versus 0.091 days) and general ward in by 34 percent (0.705 versus 1.076 days). Surviving CRT-ON patients (88.2 percent versus 77.5 percent) remained in better functional class longer, and they achieved an improvement of 0.9 life years (LYGs) and 0.77 years quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). CRT-ON proved to be cost-effective after 6 years, except for the 7th year due to battery depletion. At 10 years, the results were euro18,431 per LYG and euro21,500 per QALY gained.

11278,A cost-effectiveness analysis of subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44mcg 3-times a week vs no treatment for patients with clinically isolated syndrome in Sweden,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous interferon (sc IFN) beta-1a 44 mcg 3-times weekly (tiw) vs no treatment at reducing the risk of conversion to multiple sclerosis (MS) in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) in Sweden. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the clinical course of patients with CIS treated with sc IFN beta-1a 44 mcg tiw or no treatment over a 40-year time horizon. Costs were estimated from a societal perspective in 2012 Swedish kronor (SEK). Treatment efficacy data were derived from the REFLEX trial; resource use and quality-of-life (QoL) data were obtained from the literature. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses explored whether results were robust to changes in input values and use of Poser criteria. RESULTS: Using McDonald criteria sc IFN beta-1a was cost-saving and more effective (i.e., dominant) vs no treatment. Gains in progression free life years (PFLYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were 1.63 and 0.53, respectively. Projected cost savings were 270,263 SEK. For Poser criteria cost savings of 823,459 SEK were estimated, with PFLY and QALY gains of 4.12 and 1.38, respectively. Subcutaneous IFN beta-1a remained dominant from a payer perspective. Results were insensitive to key input variation. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated a 99.9% likelihood of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 500,000 SEK/QALY. CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous IFN beta-1a is a cost-effective option for the treatment of patients at high risk of MS conversion. It is associated with lower costs, greater QALY gains, and more time free of MS. LIMITATIONS: The risk of conversion from CIS to MS was extrapolated from 2-year trial data.

11279,Economic evaluation of a lifestyle intervention in primary care to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness studies of lifestyle interventions in people at risk for lifestyle-related diseases, addressing ''real-world'' implementation, are needed. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of a primary care intervention from a societal perspective, compared with provision of health brochures, alongside a randomized controlled trial. METHODS: Adults aged 30-50 years, at risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD), were recruited from twelve general practices in The Netherlands. They were randomized to the intervention (n = 314) or control group (n = 308). The intervention consisted of up to six face-to-face counseling sessions with a trained practice nurse, followed by three-monthly sessions by phone. Costs were collected using three-monthly retrospective questionnaires. Quality of life was measured with the EuroQol-5D-3L, at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months. Nine-year risk of developing T2DM and ten-year risk of CVD mortality were estimated using the ARIC and SCORE formulae, respectively, based on measurements at baseline and 24 months while applying a fixed age of 60 years at both time points. RESULTS: Small, statistically non-significant differences in effects were found between the intervention and control group with regard to risk scores and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained. The mean difference in costs between the intervention and control group was euro-866 (95% confidence interval -2372; 370). The probability that the intervention was cost-effective varied from 93% at euro8000/QALY to 88% at euro80,000/QALY. CONCLUSION: A primary care lifestyle intervention aimed at adults at increased risk of T2DM and/or CVD could result in cost savings over a two-year period. However, due to methodological uncertainty no advice can be given regarding the implementation of the intervention in Dutch general practices.

As such, the aim of the present study is to evaluate a model of the consequences of the timing of this intervention from a societal economic perspective. Average cost utility of pediatric CI by age at intervention will be analyzed. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal assessment of health utility and educational placement outcomes in 175 children recruited from six U.S. centers between November 2002 and December 2004, who had severe-to-profound SNHL onset within 1 year of age, underwent CI before 5 years of age, and had up to 6 years of postimplant follow-up that ended in November 2008 to December 2011. Costs of care were collected retrospectively and stratified by preoperative, operative, and postoperative expenditures. Incremental costs and benefits of implantation were compared among the three age groups and relative to a nonimplantation baseline. RESULTS: Children implanted at <18 months of age gained an average of 10.7 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over their projected lifetime as compared with 9.0 and 8.4 QALYs for those implanted between 18 and 36 months and at >36 months of age, respectively. Medical and surgical complication rates were not significantly different among the three age groups. In addition, mean lifetime costs of implantation were similar among the three groups, at approximately $2000/child/year (77.5-year life expectancy), yielding costs of $14,996, $17,849, and $19,173 per QALY for the youngest, middle, and oldest implant age groups, respectively.

Early (<18 months) intervention with CI was associated with greater and longer quality-of-life improvements, similar direct costs of implantation, and economically valuable improved classroom placement, without a greater incidence of medical and surgical complications when compared to CI at older ages.",2013-01-11150,23558665,Ear Hear,Yevgeniy R Semenov,2013,34 / 4,402-412,No,23558665,"Yevgeniy R Semenov; Susan T Yeh; Meena Seshamani; Nae-Yuh Wang; Emily A Tobey; Laurie S Eisenberg; Alexandra L Quittner; Kevin D Frick; John K Niparko; CDaCI Investigative Team; Age-dependent cost-utility of pediatric cochlear implantation, Ear Hear, 2013 Jul-Aug; 34(4):0196-0202; 402-412",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cochlear implantation at age 36+ months vs. Non-implanted control,developmental scores on Bayley Scales of Infant Development Mental Scale or Motor Scale (BSID II) of at least 70,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,19173,United States,2011,22060.13
11283,Cost-effectiveness of systemic therapies for metastatic pancreatic cancer,"PURPOSE: Gemcitabine and capecitabine (gem-cap), gemcitabine and erlotinib (gem-e), and folfirinox (5-fluorouracil-leucovorin-irinotecan-oxaliplatin) are new treatment options for metastatic pancreatic cancer, but they are also more expensive and potentially more toxic than gemcitabine alone (gem). We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of these treatment options compared with gem. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to examine costs and outcomes of gem-cap, gem-e, folfirinox, and gem in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer from the perspective of a government health care plan. Ontario health economic and costing data (2010 Canadian dollars) were used. Efficacy data for the treatments were obtained from the published literature. Resource utilization data were derived from a chart review of consecutive metastatic patients treated for pancreatic cancer at Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, 2008-2009, and supplemented with data from the literature. Utilities were obtained by surveying medical oncologists across Canada using the EQ-5D. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (icers) were calculated. RESULTS: The icers for gem-cap, gem-e, and folfirinox compared with gem were, respectively, CA$84,299, CA$153,631, and CA$133,184 per quality-adjusted life year (qaly). The model was driven mostly by drug acquisition costs. Given a willingness-to-pay (wtp) threshold greater than CA$130,000/qaly, folfirinox was most cost-effective treatment. When the wtp threshold was less than CA$80,000/qaly, gem alone was most cost-effective. The gem-e option was dominated by the other treatments.

11286,Cost Effectiveness Associated with Helicobacter pylori Screening and Eradication in Patients Taking Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs and/or Aspirin,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study was performed to investigate the cost effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori screening/eradication in South Korean patients treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or aspirin. METHODS: A decision Markov model was used to estimate the effectiveness and economic impact of an H. pylori screening/eradication strategy compared to a no-screening strategy among patients who were included in the model at the age of 40 years. Utility weights were applied to four of the health status groups to reflect quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The costs of screening, H. pylori eradication, and managing peptic ulcer and ulcer complications were obtained from South Korea-specific data. RESULTS: The total costs per patient were US $2,454 for the H. pylori screening/eradication and US $3,182 for the no-screening strategy. The QALYs for the two strategies were 16.05 and 15.73, respectively. The results were robust for the analyses of all different cohort groups who entered the model at the age of 30, 50, or 60 years and for NSAIDs-naive patients. Through the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the robustness of our study''s results was also determined.

11287,Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion for Adjacent-Segment Disease: Clinical Outcomes and Cost-Utility of Surgical Intervention,"STUDY DESIGN:: Retrospective review. OBJECTIVE:: Determine clinical outcomes and cost utility of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for the treatment of adjacent segment disease (ASD). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA:: The incidence of symptomatic ASD after ACDF has been estimated to occur in up to 26% of patients. Commonly, these patients will undergo an additional ACDF procedure. However, there are currently no studies available that adequately describe the clinical outcomes or cost-utility of performing ACDF for ASD. METHODS:: A retrospective review of 40 patients undergoing ACDF for ASD was performed. Baseline and 2-year neck and arm pain (NRS-NP, NRS-AP), neck disability index (NDI), physical and mental quality of life (SF-12 PCS & MCS), and Zung depression score (ZDS) were assessed. Two-year total neck-related medical resource utilization, amount of missed work, and health-state values were determined. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated from EQ-5D assessments with U.S. valuation. Comprehensive costs (indirect, direct, and total cost) and the value (cost-per-QALY gained) of performing ACDF for ASD were assessed. RESULTS:: Performing ACDF to treat ASD resulted in significant improvements (P<0.05) in NRS-NP, NRS-AP, NDI, SF-12 PCS, and ZDS outcome measures. Patient-reported health states also significantly improved, with a mean cumulative two-year gain of 0.54 QALYs. The mean two-year cost of surgery was $32,616 (direct cost: $25,391; indirect cost: $7,225). ACDF for the treatment of ASD was associated with a mean two-year cost per QALY gained of $60,526. CONCLUSIONS:: Performing ACDF for ASD resulted in significant improvements in patient pain, disability, and quality of life. Further, the mean 2-year cost-per-QALY was determined to be $60,526, which suggests surgical intervention to be cost-effective. This study is the first to provide evidence that performing an ACDF for ASD is both clinically and cost-effective.",2013-01-11157,23563337,J Spinal Disord Tech,Kevin R O'Neill,2013,/,,No,23563337,"Kevin R O'Neill; Robert J Wilson; Katharine M Burns; Lauren M Mioton; Brian T Wright; Owoicho Adogwa; Matthew J McGirt; Clinton J Devin; Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion for Adjacent-Segment Disease: Clinical Outcomes and Cost-Utility of Surgical Intervention, J Spinal Disord Tech , ; ():1539-2465",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion vs. None,Not Stated,70 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,60526,United States,2011,69640.19
11288,OPCAB surgery is cost-effective for elderly patients,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effective operative strategy for coronary artery bypass surgery in patients above 70 years. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled trial of 900 patients above 70 years of age subjected to coronary artery bypass surgery. Patients were randomized to either on-pump or off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. Data on direct and indirect costs were prospectively collected. Preoperatively and six months postoperatively, quality of life was assessed using EuroQol-5D questionnaires. Perioperative in-hospital costs and costs of re-intervention were included. RESULTS: The Summary Score of EuroQol-5D increased in both groups between preoperatively and postoperatively. In the on-pump group, it increased from 0.75 (0.16) (mean (SD)) to 0.84 (0.17), while the increase in the off-pump group was from 0.75 (0.15) to 0.84 (0.18). The difference between the groups was 0.0016 QALY and not significantly different. The mean costs were 148.940 D.Kr (CI, 130.623 D.Kr-167.252 D.Kr) for an on-pump patient and 138.693 D.Kr (CI, 123.167 D.Kr-154.220 D.Kr) for an off-pump patient. The ICER base-case point estimate was 6,829,999 D.Kr/QALY. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed 89% probability of off-pump being cost-effective at a threshold value of 269,400 D.Kr/QALY.

11289,Cost-effectiveness analysis comparing degarelix with leuprolide in hormonal therapy for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer,"Degarelix, approved in the USA in 2008, is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist, representing one of the latest additions to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT is used as first-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer with the aim to reduce testosterone to castrate levels. Like other gonadotropin-releasing hormone-antagonists, degarelix treatment results in rapid decrease in luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone levels without the associated risk of flare. Using one registration trial for degarelix with leuprolide as the active control, a cost-effectiveness analysis with a Markov model and a 20-year time horizon found the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for degarelix to be US$245/quality-adjusted life years.

The risk of intergenerational infection of pertussis is of concern. The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative vaccination programmes for replacing the conventional diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccine programme administered in adolescence, considering the risk of intergenerational infection. METHODS: We examined the cost-effectiveness of 4 pertussis vaccination programmes: (1) one-time adolescent DT vaccination (DT); (2) one-time adolescent DT-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccination; (3) one-time adolescent DTaP with decennial booster (DTaP+booster); and (4) one-time adolescent DTaP with additional vaccination targeted at parents with infants (additional DTaP for parents). We adapted a state-transition Markov model to estimate the costs and effectiveness of vaccination in the adolescent and adult cohorts and then considered intergenerational infection from adolescents/adults to infants. We assumed a societal perspective to estimate results and expressed these in terms of cost, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, benefit-cost ratio (BCR), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: At an incidence of 25 per 100,000, the ICERs of the DTaP and additional DTaP for parents strategies were 3,576,072 JPY and 240,055,273 JPY, respectively, when intergenerational transmission of infection was considered.

11293,The cost-effectiveness of the decision to hospitalize nursing home residents with advanced dementia,"CONTEXT: Nursing home (NH) residents with advanced dementia commonly experience burdensome and costly hospitalizations that may not extend survival or improve quality of life. Cost-effectiveness analyses of decisions to hospitalize these residents have not been reported. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of 1) not having a do-not-hospitalize (DNH) order and 2) hospitalization for suspected pneumonia in NH residents with advanced dementia. METHODS: NH residents from 22 NHs in the Boston area were followed in the Choices, Attitudes, and Strategies for Care of Advanced Dementia at the End-of-Life study conducted between February 2003 and February 2009. We conducted cost-effectiveness analyses of aggressive treatment strategies for advanced dementia residents living in NHs when they suffer from acute illness. Primary outcome measures included quality-adjusted life days (QALD) and quality-adjusted life years, Medicare expenditures, and incremental net benefits (INBs) over 15 months. RESULTS: Compared with a less aggressive strategy of avoiding hospital transfer (i.e., having DNH orders), the strategy of hospitalization was associated with an incremental increase in Medicare expenditures of $5972 and an incremental gain in quality-adjusted survival of 3.7 QALD. Hospitalization for pneumonia was associated with an incremental increase in Medicare expenditures of $3697 and an incremental reduction in quality-adjusted survival of 9.7 QALD. At a willingness-to-pay level of $100,000/quality-adjusted life years, the INBs of the more aggressive treatment strategies were negative and, therefore, not cost effective (INB for not having a DNH order, -$4958 and INB for hospital transfer for pneumonia, -$6355).

11295,Impact and cost-effectiveness of a universal strategy to promote physical activity in primary care: population-based cohort study and Markov model,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a universal strategy to promote physical activity in primary care. METHODS: Data were analysed for a cohort of participants from the general practice research database. Empirical estimates informed a Markov model that included five long-term conditions (diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, colorectal cancer and depression). Simulations compared an intervention promoting physical activity in healthy adults with standard care. The intervention effect on physical activity was from a meta-analysis of randomised trials. The annual cost of intervention, in the base case, was one family practice consultation per participant year. The primary outcome was net health benefit in quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: A cohort of 262,704 healthy participants entered the model. Intervention was associated with an increase in life years lived free from physical disease. With 5 years intervention the increase was 52 (95 % interval -11 to 115) per 1,000 participants entering the model (probability increased 91.9 %); with 10 years intervention the increase was 102 (42-164) per 1,000 (probability 99.7 %). Net health benefits at a threshold of pound30,000 per QALY were 3.2 (-11.1 to 16.9) QALYs per 1,000 participants with 5 years intervention (probability cost-effective 64.7 %) and 5.0 (-9.5 to 19.3) with 10 years intervention (probability cost-effective 72.4 %). CONCLUSIONS: A universal strategy to promote physical activity in primary care has the potential to increase life years lived free from physical disease. There is only weak evidence that a universal intervention strategy might prove cost-effective.",2013-01-11175,23572044,Eur J Health Econ,Martin C Gulliford,2014,15 / 4,,Yes,23572044,"Martin C Gulliford; Judith Charlton; Nawaraj Bhattarai; Christopher Charlton; Caroline Rudisill; Impact and cost-effectiveness of a universal strategy to promote physical activity in primary care: population-based cohort study and Markov model, Eur J Health Econ, 2014 May; 15(4):1618-7598",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal strategy to promote physical activity in primary care for 5 years vs. Standard/Usual care- No systematic approach to promote physical activity,Not Stated,100 Years,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,13685.42,United Kingdom,2010,25076.1
11296,Cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular magnetic resonance and single-photon emission computed tomography for diagnosis of coronary artery disease in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have demonstrated a superior diagnostic accuracy of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) for the detection of coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to determine the comparative cost-effectiveness of CMR versus single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). METHODS: Based on Bayes'' theorem, a mathematical model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness and utility of CMR with SPECT in patients with suspected CAD. Invasive coronary angiography served as the standard of reference. Effectiveness was defined as the accurate detection of CAD, and utility as the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. Model input parameters were derived from the literature, and the cost analysis was conducted from a German health care payer''s perspective. Extensive sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Reimbursement fees represented only a minor fraction of the total costs incurred by a diagnostic strategy. Increases in the prevalence of CAD were generally associated with improved cost-effectiveness and decreased costs per utility unit (DeltaQALY). By comparison, CMR was consistently more cost-effective than SPECT, and showed lower costs per QALY gained. Given a CAD prevalence of 0.50, CMR was associated with total costs of euro6,120 for one patient correctly diagnosed as having CAD and with euro2,246 per DeltaQALY gained versus euro7,065 and euro2,931 for SPECT, respectively. Above a threshold value of CAD prevalence of 0.60, proceeding directly to invasive angiography was the most cost-effective approach. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with low to intermediate CAD probabilities, CMR is more cost-effective than SPECT. Moreover, lower costs per utility unit indicate a superior clinical utility of CMR.",2013-01-11180,23574690,J Cardiovasc Magn Reson,Julia Boldt,2013,15 /,30,No,23574690,"Julia Boldt; Alexander W Leber; Klaus Bonaventura; Christian Sohns; Martin Stula; Alexander Huppertz; Wilhelm Haverkamp; Marc Dorenkamp; Cost-effectiveness of cardiovascular magnetic resonance and single-photon emission computed tomography for diagnosis of coronary artery disease in Germany, J Cardiovasc Magn Reson, ; 15():1532-429X; 30",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) vs. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,373.33,Euro,2012,541.15
11297,Cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in patients with Parkinson's disease,"In addition to medical treatment, deep brain stimulation has become an alternative therapeutic option in advanced Parkinson''s disease. High initial costs of surgery have to be weighted against long-term gains in health-related quality of life. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of deep brain stimulation compared with long-term medical treatment. We performed a cost-utility analysis using a lifetime Markov model for Parkinson''s disease. Health utilities were evaluated using the EQ-5D generic health status measure. Data on effectiveness and adverse events were obtained from clinical studies, published reports, or meta-analyses. Costs were assessed from the German health care provider perspective. Both were discounted at 3% per year. Key assumptions affecting costs and health status were investigated using one-way and two-way sensitivity analyses. The lifetime incremental cost-utility ratio for deep brain stimulation was euro6700 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and euro9800 and euro2500 per United Parkinson''s Disease Rating Scale part II (motor experiences of daily living) and part III (motor examination) score point gained, respectively. Deep brain stimulation costs were mainly driven by the cost of surgery and of battery exchange. Health status was improved and motor complications were reduced by DBS. Sensitivity analysis revealed that battery life time was the most influential parameter, with the incremental cost-utility ratio ranging from euro20,000 per QALY to deep brain stimulation dominating medical treatment. Deep brain stimulation can be considered cost-effective, offering a value-for-money profile comparable to other well accepted health care technologies.

11298,The cost-effectiveness of prenatal detection for congenital heart disease using telemedicine screening,"We estimated the longer-term cost-effectiveness of using telemedicine screening for prenatal detection of congenital heart disease (CHD). One hospital in south-east England with a telemedicine service was connected to a fetal cardiology unit in London. A UK health service perspective was adopted. Evidence on costs and outcomes for standard-risk pregnant women during the antenatal period was based on patient-level data. Extrapolation beyond the end of the study (just after delivery) was carried out for the lifetime of children born with and without CHD. Expert opinion and data from published sources was used to populate a decision model. Future costs and benefits were discounted. The main outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and results were expressed as cost per QALY gained. Various one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. The model showed that offering telemedicine screening by specialists to all standard-risk pregnant women was the dominant strategy (i.e. cheaper and more effective). The sensitivity analyses found that the model was robust, and that telemedicine remained the most cost-effective strategy. The study showed that it would be cost-effective to provide telemedicine examinations as part of an antenatal screening programme for all standard-risk women.",2013-01-11188,23576807,J Telemed Telecare,Hema Mistry,2013,19 / 4,,No,23576807,"Hema Mistry; Helena M Gardiner; The cost-effectiveness of prenatal detection for congenital heart disease using telemedicine screening, J Telemed Telecare, 2013 Jun; 19(4):1357-633X",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prenatal detection for congenital heart disease using telemedicine screening (scan is further reviewed by a specialist using a store-and-forward approach via the telemedicine service & subsequent antenatal care is provided in the district hospital) vs. Standard/Usual Care,18 to 20 weeks and 6 days pregnant,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,-714.29,United Kingdom,2009,-1247.67
11299,Cost-effectiveness of depression case management in small practices,"BACKGROUND: Case management undertaken by healthcare assistants in small primary care practices is effective in improving depression symptoms and adherence in patients with major depression. AIMS: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of depression case management by healthcare assistants in small primary care practices. METHOD: Cost-effectiveness analysis on the basis of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (2005-2008): practice-based healthcare assistants in 74 practices provided case management to 562 patients with major depression over 1 year. Our primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) calculated as the ratio of differences in mean costs and mean number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Our secondary outcome was the mean depression-free days (DFDs) between the intervention and control group at 24-month follow-up. The study was registered at the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number Registry: ISRCTN66386086. RESULTS: Intervention v. control group: no significant difference in QALYs; significantly more DFDs (mean: 373 v. 311, P<0.01); no significant difference in mean direct healthcare costs (euro4495 v. euro3506, P = 0.16); considerably lower mean indirect costs (euro5228 v. euro7539, P = 0.06), resulting in lower total costs (euro9723 v. euro11 045, P = 0.41). The point estimate for the cost-utility ratio was euro38 429 per QALY gained if only direct costs were considered, and ''dominance'' of the intervention if total costs were considered. Yet, regardless of decision makers'' willingness to pay per QALY, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective was never above 90%. CONCLUSIONS: In small primary care practices, 1 year of case management did not increase the number of QALYs but it did increase the number of DFDs.

11300,Cost-effectiveness of helicopter versus ground emergency medical services for trauma scene transport in the United States,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: We determine the minimum mortality reduction that helicopter emergency medical services (EMS) should provide relative to ground EMS for the scene transport of trauma victims to offset higher costs, inherent transport risks, and inevitable overtriage of patients with minor injury. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare the costs and outcomes of helicopter versus ground EMS transport to a trauma center from a societal perspective during a patient''s lifetime. We determined the mortality reduction needed to make helicopter transport cost less than $100,000 and $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained compared with ground EMS. Model inputs were derived from the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma, National Trauma Data Bank, Medicare reimbursements, and literature. We assessed robustness with probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Helicopter EMS must provide a minimum of a 15% relative risk reduction in mortality (1.3 lives saved/100 patients with the mean characteristics of the National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma cohort) to cost less than $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained and a reduction of at least 30% (3.3 lives saved/100 patients) to cost less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Helicopter EMS becomes more cost-effective with significant reductions in patients with minor injury who are triaged to air transport or if long-term disability outcomes are improved. CONCLUSION: Helicopter EMS needs to provide at least a 15% mortality reduction or a measurable improvement in long-term disability to compare favorably with other interventions considered cost-effective. Given current evidence, it is not clear that helicopter EMS achieves this mortality or disability reduction. Reducing overtriage of patients with minor injury to helicopter EMS would improve its cost-effectiveness.",2013-01-11200,23582619,Ann Emerg Med,M Kit Delgado,2013,62 / 4,,No,23582619,"M Kit Delgado; Kristan L Staudenmayer; N Ewen Wang; David A Spain; Sharada Weir; Douglas K Owens; Jeremy D Goldhaber-Fiebert; Cost-effectiveness of helicopter versus ground emergency medical services for trauma scene transport in the United States, Ann Emerg Med, 2013 Oct; 62(4):0196-0644",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Helicopter trauma transport to a trauma center vs. Ground EMS trauma transport,Not Stated,85 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2009,Not Stated
