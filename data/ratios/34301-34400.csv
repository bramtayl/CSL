34301,Cost effectiveness analysis of a polygenic risk tailored breast cancer screening programme in Singapore.,"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a breast cancer screening programme that incorporates genetic testing using breast cancer associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), against the current biennial mammogram-only screening programme to aid in its implementation into the current programme in Singapore. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare the costs and health outcomes of the current screening programme, against a polygenic risk-tailored screening programme, which can advise a long-term screening strategy depending on the individual's polygenic risk. The model took the perspective of the healthcare system, with a time horizon of 40 years, following women from the age of 35 to 74. Epidemiological and cost data were taken from Asian studies, and an annual discount rate of 3% was used. The model outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated from the difference in costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Scenarios with varying risk thresholds for each polygenic risk group were examined. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The ICER for a polygenic risk-tailored breast cancer screening programme, compared with the current biennial mammogram-only screening programme, was - 3713.80 SGD/QALY, with incremental costs < 0 and incremental effects > 0. The scenario analysis of different polygenic risk cutoffs showed that the ICERs remain negative, with all ICERs falling within the south-east quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane, indicating that tailored screening is more cost effective than mammogram-only screening, with lower costs and higher QALYs to be gained. This suggests that a polygenic risk-tailored breast cancer screening programme is cost effective, entailing lower cost than the current mammogram-only programme, while causing no additional harm to women. CONCLUSION: Results from this cost-effectiveness analysis show that polygenic risk-tailored screening is cost effective with an ICER of - 3713.80 SGD/QALY. Tailored screening remains cost effective even across varying percentile cutoffs for each risk group. While the results look promising for incorporating polygenic risk into the current breast cancer screening programme, further studies should be conducted to address various limitations.",2021-01-41752,33892705,BMC Health Serv Res,"Wong, Jerry Zeng Yang",2021,21 / 1,379,No,33892705,"Wong, Jerry Zeng Yang; Chai, Jia Hui; Yeoh, Yen Shing; Mohamed Riza, Nur Khaliesah; Jenny Liu; Teo, Yik-Ying; Wee, Hwee Lin; Mikael Hartman; Cost effectiveness analysis of a polygenic risk tailored breast cancer screening programme in Singapore., BMC Health Serv Res, 2021 Apr 23; 21(1):; 379",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Screening,polygenic risk tailored breast cancer screening program vs. current mammogram-only program,Not Stated,74 Years,35 Years,Female,Full,"40 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,-3713.8,Singapore,2019,-2885.86
34302,Cost-Effectiveness of Treatment Thresholds for Subsolid Pulmonary Nodules in CT Lung Cancer Screening.,"Background Guidelines such as the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) are available for determining when subsolid nodules should be treated within lung cancer screening programs, but they are based on expert opinion. Purpose To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of varying treatment thresholds for subsolid nodules within a lung cancer screening setting by using a simulation model. Materials and Methods A previously developed model simulated 10 million current and former smokers undergoing CT lung cancer screening who were assumed to have a ground-glass nodule (GGN) at baseline. Nodules were allowed to grow and to develop solid components over time according to a monthly cycle and lifetime horizon. Management strategies generated by varying treatment thresholds, including the solid component size and use of the Brock risk calculator, were tested. For each strategy, average U.S. costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient were computed, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of those on the efficient frontier were calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of results were performed by varying several relevant parameters, such as treatment costs or malignancy growth rates. Results Variants of the Lung-RADS guidelines that did not treat pure GGNs were cost-effective. Strategies based on the Brock risk calculator did not reach the efficient frontier. The strategy with the highest QALYs under a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY included no treatment of GGNs and a threshold of 4-mm solid component size for treatment of subsolid nodules. This strategy yielded an ICER of $52 993 per QALY (95% CI: 44 407, 64 372). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed this was the optimal strategy under a range of parameter variations. Conclusion Treatment of pure ground-glass nodules was not cost-effective.

34305,Cost-effectiveness analysis of hemodialysis plus hemoperfusion versus hemodialysis alone in adult patients with end-stage renal disease in China.,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of hemodialysis (HD) plus hemoperfusion (HP) with HD alone in adult patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in China. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to assess the cost-effectiveness of interventions over a lifetime horizon. Model parameters were informed by the HD/HP trial, the first randomized, open-label multicenter trial comparing survival outcomes and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) for HD + HP versus HD alone, and supplemented by published literature and expert opinion. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with respect to quality adjusted life-years (QALY). The robustness of the results was examined in extensive sensitivity analyses. Analyses were conducted from a healthcare perspective. Costs were reported in both Chinese Renminbi (RMB) and US Dollars (USD) in 2019 values. RESULTS: The base case ICER of HD + HP is RMB 174,486 (USD 25,251) per QALY, which is lower than the RMB 212,676 (USD 30,778) willingness-to-pay threshold of three times Gross Domestic Product. This conclusion is sensitive to the mortality for patients with no severe CVD events, the incidence of CVD events, and the cost of HP and HD. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of RMB 212,676 (USD 30,778) per QALY gained, the probability that HD + HP is cost-effective is 58%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate a potential for HD + HP to be cost-effective for patients with ESRD. Further evidence on the longer-term impact of HD + HP on CVD event rates and mortality unrelated to CVD is needed to robustly demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of HD + HP.

34306,Cost-Effectiveness of Adjuvant Treatment for Ductal Carcinoma In Situ.,"PURPOSE: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for 20% of breast cancer cases in the United States and is potentially overtreated, leading to high expenditures and low-value care. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis evaluating all adjuvant treatment strategies for DCIS. METHODS: A Markov model was created with six competing treatment strategies: observation, tamoxifen (TAM) alone, aromatase inhibitor (AI) alone, radiation treatment (RT) alone, RT + TAM, and RT + AI. Baseline recurrence rates were modeled using the NSABP B17 and RTOG 9804 trials for standard-risk and good-risk DCIS, respectively. Relative risk reductions and adverse event rates for each treatment strategy were derived from meta-analyses of large randomized trials. We used a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 in US dollars/quality-adjusted life-year and a lifetime horizon for two cohorts of women, age 40 and 60 years. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses evaluated the robustness of base-case results. RESULTS: RT alone was cost-effective for patients with standard-risk DCIS, and observation was cost-effective for patients with good-risk DCIS, across both age groups. Strategies including TAM or AI resulted in fewer quality-adjusted life-years than observation, because of the prolonged decrement in quality of life outweighing the modest benefit in ipsilateral risk reduction. In sensitivity analysis, RT alone was cost-effective for age 40, good-risk patients when ipsilateral risk reduction matched that of the RTOG 9804 trial, there was minimal increased risk of contralateral breast secondary malignancy, or there was strong patient willingness to pursue RT. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that cost-effective and clinically optimal treatment strategies are RT alone for standard-risk DCIS and observation for good-risk DCIS, with personalization on the basis of patient age and preference for RT.

RESULTS: RT alone was cost-effective for patients with standard-risk DCIS, and observation was cost-effective for patients with good-risk DCIS, across both age groups.

34322,Economic evaluation of Cytosponge®-trefoil factor 3 for Barrett esophagus: A cost-utility analysis of randomised controlled trial data.,"BACKGROUND: Esophageal adenocarcinoma has a very poor prognosis unless detected early. The Cytosponge-trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) is a non-endoscopic test for Barrett esophagus, a precursor of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Randomised controlled trial data from the BEST3 trial has shown that an offer of Cytosponge-TFF3 in the primary care setting in England to individuals on medication for acid reflux increases detection of Barrett esophagus 10-fold over a year compared with standard care. This is an economic evaluation of Cytosponge-TFF3 screening versus usual care using data from the BEST3 trial which took place between 20th March 2017 and 21st March 2019. METHODS: A Markov model with a one-year cycle-length and a lifetime time horizon was created, adapting previous modeling work on Cytosponge screening. The impact of one round of Cytosponge screening was modelled in patients with a median age of 69 years (based on BEST3 trial population). Cost-effectiveness was expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted on model parameters. FINDINGS: Per person, one round of Cytosponge-TFF3 screening, including confirmatory endoscopy and treatment, in the intervention arm costed £82 more than usual care and generated an additional 0.015 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an ICER of £5,500 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis gave an ICER of £5,405 (95% CI -£6,791 to £17,600). The average QALY gain per person is small because the majority of patients in the model will not develop BE and therefore will have no resulting change in their utility, however the small proportion of patients who are identified with BE dysplasia or cancer derive large benefit. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY, the probability that Cytosponge-TFF3 was cost-effective was over 90%. INTERPRETATION: Using data from a pragmatic randomised trial, one-off Cytosponge-TFF3 screen is cost-effective relative to usual care for patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease, despite relatively low uptake and an older population in this trial setting than previously modelled. Improving Cytosponge-TFF3 uptake and targeting younger patients is likely to further improve cost-effectiveness.",2021-01-42124,34195582,EClinicalMedicine,Nicholas Swart,2021,37 /,100969,No,34195582,"Nicholas Swart; Roberta Maroni; Beth Muldrew; Peter Sasieni; Rebecca Fitzgerald; Stephen Morris; Economic evaluation of Cytosponge®-trefoil factor 3 for Barrett esophagus: A cost-utility analysis of randomised controlled trial data., EClinicalMedicine, 2021 Jul; 37():; 100969",QALY,United Kingdom,"Diseases of oesophagus, stomach and duodenum",Screening,cytosponge-trefoil factor 3 screening for Barrett’s esophagus vs. usual care for Barrett’s esophagus,Not Stated,Not Stated,69 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,34466.67,United Kingdom,2019,46647.77

34326,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Community Case Management of Childhood Diarrhea in Burundi.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of community case management (CCM) program of childhood diarrhea by providing oral rehydration salts and zinc through community health workers in Burundi. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis study using a Markov modeling approach was undertaken to assess the CCM program of diarrhea from both provider and societal perspectives. The CCM program was compared with the routine management of childhood diarrhea at health facilities. Primary data on the cost of childhood diarrhea management were collected. Both economic and health outcomes were assessed for a period of 5 years, and a discount rate of 3% was applied. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The CCM program was found to be both less costly and more effective resulting to a negative value of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, indicating that the program was dominant producing cost savings. Compared with the routine treatment of diarrhea at health facilities, the CCM program would avert 2749 additional disability-adjusted life years over a period of 5 years. The economic burden was reduced of US$1 056 699 and US$2 328 531 from the provider and societal perspectives, respectively. The cost-effectiveness estimates were mostly sensitive to the discount rate and the cost of outpatient visits at health facilities. The intervention remained dominant with a 100% probability of cost savings within 10 000 simulations of the sensitivity analysis.

34328,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Robotic-assisted Lobectomy for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted thoracic surgery has emerged as an alternative to video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for treating patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of robotic-assisted lobectomy (RAL) compared with VATS and open lobectomy for adults with NSCLC. METHODS: A decision analysis model was employed to compare the cost effectiveness of RAL, VATS, and open lobectomy with 1-year time horizon from both health care and societal perspectives. Health care costs (2020$) and quality-adjusted life-years were compared between the approaches. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained. Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify variables driving cost effectiveness across several willingness-to-pay thresholds. RESULTS: Open thoracotomy was not cost effective compared with both RAL and VATS lobectomy. From the health care sector perspective, RAL was $394.97 more expensive per case than VATS resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $180 755.10 per quality-adjusted life-year.

34332,Cost-Utility Analysis of a Medication Adherence Management Service Alongside a Cluster Randomized Control Trial in Community Pharmacy.,"BACKGROUND: It is necessary to determine the cost utility of adherence interventions in chronic diseases due to humanistic and economic burden of non-adherence. PURPOSE: To evaluate, alongside a cluster-randomized controlled trial, the cost-utility of a pharmacist-led medication adherence management service (MAMS) compared with usual care in community pharmacies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The trial was conducted over six months. Patients with treatments for hypertension, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were included. Patients in the intervention group (IG) received a MAMS based on a brief complex intervention, whilst patients in the control group (CG) received usual care. The cost-utility analysis adopted a health system perspective. Costs related to medications, healthcare resources and adherence intervention were included. The effectiveness was estimated as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), using a multiple imputation missing data model. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was calculated on the total sample of patients. RESULTS: A total of 1186 patients were enrolled (IG: 633; CG: 553). The total intervention cost was estimated to be €27.33 ± 0.43 per patient for six months. There was no statistically significant difference in total cost of medications and healthcare resources per patient between IG and CG. The values of EQ-5D-5L at 6 months were significantly higher in the IG [IG: 0.881 ± 0.005 vs CG: 0.833 ± 0.006; p = 0.000]. In the base case, the service was more expensive and more effective than usual care, resulting in an ICUR of €1,494.82/QALY. In the complete case, the service resulted in an ICUR of €2,086.30/QALY, positioned between the north-east and south-east quadrants of the cost-utility plane. Using a threshold value of €20,000/QALY gained, there is a 99% probability that the intervention is cost-effective. CONCLUSION: The medication adherence management service resulted in an improvement in the quality of life of the population with chronic disease, with similar costs compared to usual care.

METHODS: We designed a Markov model to simulate treatment outcomes for advanced/recurrent endometrial cancer patients whose tumors are either microsatellite stable (MSS) or have high microsatellite instability (MSI-high). We adopted a healthcare sector perspective for the analysis. Model inputs for costs, health utility, and clinical estimates were obtained from the literature including data from GOG0209 and KEYNOTE-146. Primary outcomes included costs of care, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The time-horizon was three years and the discount rate was 3% annually. RESULTS: In a MSS cohort, compared to C/T, first-line treatment with P/L increased treatment costs by $212,670 and decreased QALYs by 0.28 per patient. In a MSI-high cohort, compared to C/T, P/L increased costs by $313,487 and increased QALYs by 0.11 per patient, representing an ICER of $2,849,882 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses found that the price of the new drugs was the most important determinant of the ICER and that the price of the new drugs would need to decrease by 85% to $2817 per cycle to reach a $150,000/QALY threshold. CONCLUSION: In the MSS model, we found that first-line therapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer with P/L increased costs and worsened outcomes compared to C/T.

34336,Cost-effectiveness of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and MRI-guided biopsy in a population-based prostate cancer screening setting using a micro-simulation model.,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) and MRI-guided biopsy has improved the diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, it remains uncertain whether it is cost-effective, especially in a population-based screening strategy. METHODS: We used a micro-simulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of an MRI-based prostate cancer screening in comparison to the classical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening, at a population level. The test sensitivity parameters for the mpMRI and MRI-guided biopsy, grade misclassification rates, utility estimates, and the unit costs of different interventions were obtained from literature. We assumed the same screening attendance rate and biopsy compliance rate for both strategies. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis, consisting of 1000 model runs, was performed to estimate a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and assess uncertainty. A €20,000 willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and a discounting rate of 3.5% was considered in the analysis. RESULTS: The MRI-based screening improved the life-years (LY) and QALYs gained by 3.5 and 3, respectively, in comparison to the classical screening pathway. Based on the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the MRI screening pathway leads to total discounted mean incremental costs of €15,413 (95% confidence interval (CI) of €14,556-€16,272) compared to the classical screening pathway. The corresponding discounted mean incremental QALYs gained was 1.36 (95% CI of 1.31-1.40), resulting in a mean ICER of €11,355 per QALY gained. At a WTP threshold of €20,000, the MRI screening pathway has about 84% chance to be more cost-effective than the classical screening pathway. CONCLUSIONS: For triennial screening from age 55-64, incorporation of mpMRI as a reflex test after a positive PSA test result with a subsequent MRI-guided biopsy has a high probability to be more cost-effective as compared with the classical prostate cancer screening pathway.",2021-01-41979,33991077,Cancer Med,Abraham Getaneh,2021,10 / 12,4046-4053,No,33991077,"Abraham Getaneh; Heijnsdijk, Eveline Am; Harry de Koning; Cost-effectiveness of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging and MRI-guided biopsy in a population-based prostate cancer screening setting using a micro-simulation model., Cancer Med, 2021 Jun; 10(12):; 4046-4053",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Diagnostic,multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging vs. prostate-specific antigen screening,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,Male,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,11355,Euro,2019,13480.89
34337,Cost-effectiveness analysis of enzalutamide for patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate cost-effectiveness of enzalutamide in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients in Japan. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to capture time spent by patients in various health states: stable, progression and death. Abiraterone acetate and docetaxel were set as active comparators. Clinical outcomes were obtained from the PREVAIL, COU-AA-302 and TAX327 trials. Treatment sequence, concomitant drugs and therapies for adverse events were estimated from responses to a survey by 14 Japanese prostate cancer experts. The analytic perspective was public healthcare payer, with a 10-year time horizon. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated from quality-adjusted life-years and Japanese public healthcare costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: According to the survey, the most common treatment sequences were (i) enzalutamide → docetaxel → cabazitaxel (enzalutamide-first sequencing), (ii) abiraterone → enzalutamide → docetaxel (abiraterone-first sequencing) and (iii) docetaxel→ enzalutamide → cabazitaxel (docetaxel-first sequencing). In the base-case analysis, enzalutamide-first sequencing saved 1.74 million Japanese Yen versus abiraterone-first sequencing, with a 0.129 quality-adjusted life-year gain (dominant). Enzalutamide-first sequencing had a cost increase of 4.44 million Japanese Yen over docetaxel-first sequencing, with a 0.371 quality-adjusted life-years gain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of enzalutamide-first sequencing versus docetaxel-first sequencing was estimated as 11.94 million Japanese Yen/quality-adjusted life-years.

34338,Cost-effectiveness analysis of enzalutamide for patients with chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in Japan.,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate cost-effectiveness of enzalutamide in chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients in Japan. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to capture time spent by patients in various health states: stable, progression and death. Abiraterone acetate and docetaxel were set as active comparators. Clinical outcomes were obtained from the PREVAIL, COU-AA-302 and TAX327 trials. Treatment sequence, concomitant drugs and therapies for adverse events were estimated from responses to a survey by 14 Japanese prostate cancer experts. The analytic perspective was public healthcare payer, with a 10-year time horizon. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated from quality-adjusted life-years and Japanese public healthcare costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: According to the survey, the most common treatment sequences were (i) enzalutamide → docetaxel → cabazitaxel (enzalutamide-first sequencing), (ii) abiraterone → enzalutamide → docetaxel (abiraterone-first sequencing) and (iii) docetaxel→ enzalutamide → cabazitaxel (docetaxel-first sequencing). In the base-case analysis, enzalutamide-first sequencing saved 1.74 million Japanese Yen versus abiraterone-first sequencing, with a 0.129 quality-adjusted life-year gain (dominant). Enzalutamide-first sequencing had a cost increase of 4.44 million Japanese Yen over docetaxel-first sequencing, with a 0.371 quality-adjusted life-years gain. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of enzalutamide-first sequencing versus docetaxel-first sequencing was estimated as 11.94 million Japanese Yen/quality-adjusted life-years. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that, compared with abiraterone-first sequencing, enzalutamide-first sequencing had an 87.4% probability of being dominant.

The cost-effectiveness of coronary interventions in this setting is not known. Methods and Results We developed a Markov cohort simulation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients with chronic kidney disease who were hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina. Model inputs were primarily drawn from a sample of 14 300 patients identified using the Medicare 20% sample. Survival, quality-adjusted life-years, costs, and cost-effectiveness were projected over a 20-year time horizon. Multivariable models indicated higher 30-day mortality and end-stage renal disease with both PCI and CABG, and higher stroke with CABG, relative to medical therapy. However, the model projected long-term gains of 0.72 quality-adjusted life-years (0.97 life-years) for PCI compared with medical therapy, and 0.93 quality-adjusted life-years (1.32 life-years) for CABG compared with PCI. Incorporation of long-term costs resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $65 326 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for PCI versus medical therapy, and $101 565 for CABG versus PCI. Results were robust to changes in input parameters but strongly influenced by the background costs of the population, and the time horizon.

34342,Cost-effectiveness analysis of ankle-brachial index screening in patients with coronary artery disease to optimize medical management.,"INTRODUCTION: Screening for peripheral artery disease (PAD) with the ankle-brachial index (ABI) test is currently not recommended in the general population; however, previous studies advocate screening in high-risk populations. Although providers may be hesitant to prescribe low-dose rivaroxaban to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) alone, given the reduction in cardiovascular events and death associated with rivaroxaban, screening for PAD with the ABI test and accordingly prescribing rivaroxaban may provide additional benefits. We sought to describe the cost-effectiveness of screening for PAD in patients with CAD to optimize this high-risk populations' medical management. METHODS: We used a Markov model to evaluate the ABI test in patients with CAD. We assumed that all patients screened would be candidates for low-dose rivaroxaban. We assessed the cost of ABI screening at $100 per patient and added additional charges for physician visits ($100) and rivaroxaban cost ($470 per month). We used a 30-day cycle and performed analysis over 35 years. We evaluated quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from previous studies and determined the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) according to our model. We performed a deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of variables with uncertainty and reported them in a Tornado diagram showing the variables with the greatest effect on the ICER. RESULTS: Our model estimates decision costs to screen or not screen at $94,953 and $82,553, respectively. The QALYs gained from screening was 0.060, generating an ICER of $207,491 per QALY. Factors most influential on the ICER were the reduction in all-cause mortality associated with rivaroxaban and the prohibitively high cost of rivaroxaban. If rivaroxaban cost less than $95 per month, this would make screening cost-effective based on a willingness to pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: According to our model, screening patients with CAD for PAD to start low-dose rivaroxaban is not currently cost-effective due to insufficient reduction in all-cause mortality and high medication costs. Nevertheless, vascular surgeons have a unique opportunity to prescribe or advocate for low-dose rivaroxaban in patients with PAD to improve cardiovascular outcomes.",2021-01-41983,34175383,J Vasc Surg,Hataka Minami,2021,74 / 6,2030-2039.e2,No,34175383,"Hataka Minami; Nathan Itoga; Elizabeth George; Manuel Garcia-Toca; Cost-effectiveness analysis of ankle-brachial index screening in patients with coronary artery disease to optimize medical management., J Vasc Surg, 2021 Dec; 74(6):; 2030-2039.e2",QALY,United States of America,Ischaemic heart diseases,"Diagnostic, Pharmaceutical",ankle-brachial index screening for peripheral artery disease vs. no screening for peripheral artery disease,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"35 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,Not Stated,207491,United States,2019,219919.02
34343,Cost Utility of cognition-enhancing interventions for individuals with first-episode psychosis: a naturalistic evaluation.,"BACKGROUND: Although effective treatments are available to address the cognitive deficits experienced by individuals with first-episode psychosis, provision of such treatments within Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) programs is rare. One factor that may contribute to this is uncertainty about the cost implications of providing cognitive-enhancing treatments within the American mental healthcare system. The aim of this study is to complete a naturalistic evaluation of the cost utility of incorporating two different cognitive-enhancing interventions within an American CSC program. METHODS: Participants included 66, predominately white (75.38%), individuals with first-episode psychosis (19 women and 47 men) with a mean age of 22.71 years. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and cost of care were tracked among these individuals during their participation in a CSC program. These data were compared among three groups of participants during their first six months of care: (i) individuals who participated in metacognitive remediation therapy (MCR), (ii) individuals who participated in computerized cognitive remediation (CCR), and (iii) individuals who participated in no cognitive-enhancing intervention. RESULTS: Participation in MCR, but not CCR, was associated with larger gains in QALYs than participation in no cognitive-enhancing intervention within a CSC program. Moreover, data support the cost utility of MCR as compared to CCR or no-cognitive enhancing intervention within a CSC program. Conversely, CCR did not appear to be a cost-effective addition to CSC services. CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight the potential cost utility of incorporating MCR within CSC programs for individuals with first-episode psychosis.

34346,Cost-effectiveness analysis of first-line treatment with crizotinib in ROS1-rearranged advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Canada,"INTRODUCTION: While no direct comparative data exist for crizotinib in ROS1+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), studies have suggested clinical benefit with this targeted agent. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of crizotinib compared to standard platinum-doublet chemotherapy for first-line treatment of ROS1+ advanced NSCLC. METHODS: A Markov model was developed with a 10-year time horizon from the perspective of the Canadian publicly-funded health care system. Health states included progression-free survival (PFS), up to two further lines of therapy post-progression, palliation and death. Given a lack of comparative data and small study samples, crizotinib or chemotherapy studies with advanced ROS1+ NSCLC patients were identified and time-to-event data from digitized Kaplan-Meier curves were collected to pool PFS data. Costs of drugs, treatment administration, monitoring, adverse events and palliative care were included in 2018 Canadian dollars, with 1.5% discounting. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated probabilistically using 5000 simulations. RESULTS: In the base-case probabilistic analysis, crizotinib produced additional 0.885 life-years and 0.772 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $238,077, producing an ICER of $273,286/QALY gained. No simulations were found to be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY gained. A scenario analysis assuming efficacy equivalent to the ALK+ NSCLC population showed a slightly more favorable cost-effectiveness profile for crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: Available data appear to support superior activity of crizotinib compared to chemotherapy in ROS1+ advanced NSCLC. At the list price, crizotinib was not cost-effective at commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds across a wide range of sensitivity analyses.",2021-01-41989,34715804,BMC Cancer,Jaclyn Beca,2021,21 / 1,1162,No,34715804,"Jaclyn Beca; Shaun Walsh; Kaiwan Raza; Stacey Hubay; Andrew Robinson; Elena Mow; James Keech; Kelvin Chan; Cost-effectiveness analysis of first-line treatment with crizotinib in ROS1-rearranged advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Canada, BMC Cancer, 2021 Oct 29; 21(1):; 1162",QALY,Canada,Malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs,Pharmaceutical,crizotinib as first line treatment vs. pemetrexed-based platinum-doublet chemotherapy,"previously untreated, ROS1+ advanced non-small lung cancer",Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"10 Years, Not Stated / None",1.50,1.50,273152.85,Canada,2018,227495.55
34347,Stratified medicine using invasive coronary function testing in angina: A cost-effectiveness analysis of the British Heart Foundation CorMicA trial.,"AIM: Coronary angiography is indicated in many patients with known or suspected angina for the investigation of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, up to half of patients with symptoms of ischaemia have no obstructive coronary arteries (INOCA). This large subgroup includes patients with suspected microvascular angina (MVA) and/or vasospastic angina (VSA). Clinical guidelines relating to the management of patients with INOCA are limited. Uncertainty regarding the diagnosis of patients with INOCA presents a health economic challenge, both in terms of healthcare resource utilisation and of quality-of-life impact on patients. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of stratified medicine into the invasive management of INOCA, based on clinical and resource-use data obtained in the CorMicA trial, from a UK NHS perspective. The intervention included an invasive diagnostic procedure (IDP) of coronary vascular function during coronary angiography to define clinical endotypes to target with linked medical therapy. Outcomes of interest were mean total cost and QALY gain between treatment groups, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. We undertook probabilistic sensitivity and scenario analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost per QALY gained at 12 months was £4500 (£2937, £33264). Compared with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of £20,000 per QALY, the use of the IDP test is cost-effective. At this WTP threshold there is a 96% probability of the IDP being cost-effective, based on the uncertainty described by bootstrap analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of INOCA, particularly in women, is known to be significant.

34348,Cost-Effectiveness of Domiciliary High Flow Nasal Cannula Treatment in COPD Patients with Chronic Respiratory Failure.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of long-term domiciliary high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) treatment in COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 200 COPD patients were equally randomized into usual care ± HFNC and followed for 12 months. The outcome of the analysis was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, and the analysis was conducted from a healthcare sector perspective. Data on the patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL), gathered throughout the trial using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), was converted into EQ-5D-3L health state utility values. Costs were estimated using Danish registers and valued in British pounds (£) at price level 2019. Scenario analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the uncertainty of the results. RESULTS: The adjusted mean difference in QALYs between the HFNC group and the control group was 0.059 (95% CI: 0.017; 0.101), and the adjusted mean difference in total costs was £212 (95% CI: -1572; 1995). The analysis resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £3605 per QALY gained. At threshold values of £20.000-30.000 per QALY gained, the intervention had an 83-92% probability of being cost-effective. The scenario analyses all revealed ICERs below the set threshold value and demonstrated the robustness of the main result. CONCLUSION: This is the first cost-effectiveness study on domiciliary HFNC in Europe. The findings demonstrate that long-term domiciliary HFNC treatment is very likely to be a cost-effective addition to usual care for COPD patients with chronic respiratory failure.

34349,Nivolumab vs Pembrolizumab for Treatment of US Patients With Platinum-Refractory Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Network Meta-analysis and Cost-effectiveness Analysis.,"Importance: Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are approved for treating platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC). Physicians and patients are uncertain which drug is preferable, rendering a cost-effectiveness comparison between them necessary. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab vs pembrolizumab in treating platinum-refractory R/M HNSCC. Design, setting, and participants: Both the network meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis included patients from the CheckMate 141 and the KEYNOTE 040 phase 3 randomized clinical trials. The Checkmate 141 trial started on May 1, 2014, with the present analysis based on a September 2017 data cutoff. The KEYNOTE 040 trial started on November 17, 2014, with the present analysis based on a May 15, 2017, data cutoff. A bayesian network meta-analysis that included 856 patients was carried out, and a cost-effectiveness analysis that included 487 patients was conducted by developing a partitioned survival model, both between February and November 2020. The robustness of the model was assessed via 1-way, 2-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses; subgroup analyses were included; and scenario analyses were conducted to investigate the associations of dosage adjustment of nivolumab with cost-effectiveness. Main outcomes and measures: Life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), overall costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were measured. Results: In the cost-effectiveness analysis that included 487 patients, for US health care payers, when nivolumab was administered based on patient weight (3 mg/kg biweekly), at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $100 000 per QALY, the probability of nivolumab being cost-effective compared with pembrolizumab was 56%; at a WTP threshold of $150 000 per QALY, the probability was 62%. When nivolumab was administered at a fixed dose of 240 mg biweekly or 480 mg monthly, at a WTP threshold of $100 000 per QALY, the probability of nivolumab being cost-effective was 42% to 45%; at a WTP threshold of $150 000 per QALY, the probability was 52% to 55%. Conclusions and relevance: Findings from this network meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis suggest considering both WTP threshold and patient body weight when choosing between nivolumab and pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with platinum-refractory R/M HNSCC. When the WTP threshold was $100 000 per QALY, for patients weighing less than 72 kg, nivolumab (3 mg/kg, biweekly) was considered cost-effective; otherwise, pembrolizumab was preferable. When the WTP threshold was $150 000 per QALY, nivolumab (3 mg/kg biweekly) was considered cost-effective for patients weighing less than 75 kg; otherwise, fixed-dose nivolumab (240 mg biweekly or 480 mg monthly) provided more cost savings.",2021-01-41996,33956130,JAMA Netw Open,Rui Pei,2021,4 / 5,e218065,No,33956130,"Rui Pei; Yin Shi; Shuhe Lv; Tingting Dai; Fengyu Zhang; Shao Liu; Bin Wu; Nivolumab vs Pembrolizumab for Treatment of US Patients With Platinum-Refractory Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Network Meta-analysis and Cost-effectiveness Analysis., JAMA Netw Open, 2021 May 3; 4(5):; e218065",QALY,United States of America,Melanoma and other malignant neoplasms of skin,Pharmaceutical,nivolumab vs. pembrolizumab to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"15 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,86983,United States,2020,91069.48

Α value of information analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal vaccination policy for US adults is evolving, but previous research has shown that programs to increase vaccine uptake are economically favorable, despite parameter uncertainty. Using value of information (VOI) analysis and prior analyses, we examine the value of further research on vaccine uptake program parameters. METHODS: In US 50-64-year-olds, current vaccine recommendations with and without an uptake program were analyzed. In older adults, current recommendations and an alternative strategy (polysaccharide vaccine for all, adding conjugate vaccine only for the immunocompromised) with and without uptake programs were examined. Uptake program parameters were derived from a clinical trial (absolute uptake increase 12.3% [range 0-25%], per-person cost $1.78 [range $0.70-$2.26]), with other parameters obtained from US databases. VOI analyses incorporated probabilistic sensitivity analysis outputs into R-based regression techniques. RESULTS: In 50-64-year-olds, an uptake program cost $54,900/QALY gained compared to no uptake program. For ages ≥65, the program cost $287,000/QALY gained with the alternative strategy and $765,000/QALY with current recommendations. In younger adults, population-level expected value of perfect information (EVPI) was $59.7 million at $50,000/QALY gained and $2.8 million at $100,000/QALY gained.

34355,Expectant management of preterm premature rupture of membranes at 34 weeks: a cost effectiveness analysis.,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the outcomes and cost effectiveness of expectant management versus immediate delivery of women who experience preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) at 34 weeks. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was built using TreeAge software to compare outcomes in a theoretical cohort of 37,455 women with PPROM at 34 weeks undergoing expectant management until 37 weeks versus immediate delivery. Outcomes included fetal death, neonatal sepsis, neonatal death, neonatal neurodevelopmental delay, healthy neonate, maternal sepsis, maternal death, cost, and quality-adjusted life years. Probabilities were derived from the literature, and a cost-effectiveness threshold was set at $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year. RESULTS: In our theoretical cohort of 37,455 women, expectant management yielded 58 fewer neonatal deaths and 164 fewer cases of neonatal neurodevelopmental delay. However, it resulted in 407 more cases of neonatal sepsis and 2.7 more cases of maternal sepsis. Expectant management resulted in 3,531 more quality-adjusted life years and a cost savings of $71.9 million per year, making it a dominant strategy. Univariate sensitivity analysis demonstrated expectant management was cost effective until the weekly cost of antepartum admission exceeded $17,536 (baseline estimate: $12,520) or the risk of maternal sepsis following intraamniotic infection exceeded 20%. CONCLUSION: Our model demonstrated that expectant management of PPROM at 34 weeks yielded better outcomes on balance at a lower cost than immediate delivery. This analysis is important and timely in light of recent studies suggesting improved neonatal outcomes with expectant management. However, individual risks and preferences must be considered in making this clinical decision as expectant management may increase the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes when the risk of puerperal infection increases.",2021-01-41998,34915811,J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,Jacqueline Powell,2021,/,1-9,No,34915811,"Jacqueline Powell; Frank, Zoë C; Grace Clark; Jamie Lo; Aaron Caughey; Expectant management of preterm premature rupture of membranes at 34 weeks: a cost effectiveness analysis., J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med, 2021 Dec 16; ():; 1-9",QALY,United States of America,Maternal care related to the fetus and amniotic cavity and possible delivery problems,Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care,expectant management for preterm premature rupture of membranes vs. immediate delivery of fetus,34 weeks gestation,Not Stated,18 Years,Female,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2021,Not Stated
34356,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin for First-Line Treatment of Patients with Cd-33 Positive Acute Myeloid Leukaemia in Spain.,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) + standard of care (SOC) vs SOC alone for treatment of patients with de novo AML from a Spanish Health Service perspective. METHODS: A cohort state-transition model, with 12 health-states, was used to estimate the lifetime accumulated cost and benefits in terms of quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) in AML patients with favourable, intermediate, and unknown cytogenetic profiles. Patient profile was defined based on the ALFA-0701 trial. Therapeutic regimens were defined by 5 haematologists. SOC was assumed to be idarubicin and cytarabine, the combination most used in Spain. QALYs were estimated by applying utilities for the time spent by the cohort in each health-state and utility decrements associated with adverse events (AE). Total cost (€,2020) included drug-acquisition, hematologic stem-cell transplantation, disease management, AE management and end-of-life costs. Unit costs were derived from local databases. All parameters were validated by haematologist. Costs and outcomes were discounted (3%/year). RESULTS: Higher cost/patient (€177,618 vs €151,434) and greater QALYs (5,70 vs 4,62) were obtained with GO+SOC vs SOC. The ICUR was €24,203/QALY gained.

METHODS: A Markov model-based cost-utility analysis (CUA) and budget impact analysis were conducted. The lifetime cost and outcomes of PCV treatments were estimated. We discounted costs and outcomes at 3% per annum. Parameters were estimated using data from published literatures, local cost and utility data, and epidemiology data among Thai patients. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) resulted in the lowest lifetime cost, followed by IVB plus verteporfin photodynamic therapy (IVB+vPDT) and intravitreal aflibercept (IVA). The combination of IVB or intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR) and verteporfin photodynamic therapy (IVB+vPDT or IVR+vPDT) yielded the highest quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). When compared with IVB from a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for patients with PCV receiving IVB+vPDT, IVR+vPDT, IVA were 10,304; 54,135; and 82,738 the United States dollar (USD) per QALY gained, respectively. At the Thai societal willingness to pay threshold of 4884 USD, IVB had the highest probability of being cost-effective (99%) followed by IVB+vPDT (1%).

METHODS: A Markov model-based cost-utility analysis (CUA) and budget impact analysis were conducted. The lifetime cost and outcomes of PCV treatments were estimated. We discounted costs and outcomes at 3% per annum. Parameters were estimated using data from published literatures, local cost and utility data, and epidemiology data among Thai patients. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to account for parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) resulted in the lowest lifetime cost, followed by IVB plus verteporfin photodynamic therapy (IVB+vPDT) and intravitreal aflibercept (IVA).

34365,Cost Effectiveness of Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Compared with Meropenem for the Treatment of Patients with Ventilated Hospital-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia and Ventilator-Associated Bacterial Pneumonia.,"INTRODUCTION: The clinical efficacy and safety of ceftolozane/tazobactam for the treatment of ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (vHABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) has been demonstrated in the phase III randomised controlled trial ASPECT-NP. However, there are no published data on the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam for vHABP/VABP. These nosocomial infections are associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, and are increasingly complicated by growing rates of resistance and the inappropriate use of antimicrobials. This study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared with meropenem for the treatment of vHABP/VABP in a US hospital setting. METHODS: A short-term decision tree followed by a long-term Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years associated with ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in the treatment of patients with vHABP/VABP. Pathogen susceptibility and clinical efficacy were informed by the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS) database and ASPECT-NP, respectively. A US healthcare sector perspective was adopted, capturing direct costs borne by third-party payers or integrated health systems, and direct health effects for patients. RESULTS: In the confirmed treatment setting (post-susceptibility results), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ceftolozane/tazobactam compared to meropenem was US$12,126 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY); this reduced when used in the early treatment setting (before susceptibility results) at $4775/QALY.

34367,Health and economic impact at a population level of both primary and secondary preventive lung cancer interventions: A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis.,"OBJECTIVES: Robust economic evaluations are needed to identify efficient strategies for lung cancer prevention that combine brief and intensive smoking cessation intervention programmes with screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) at different ages, frequencies, and coverages. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation approaches combined with lung cancer screening in the European context at a population level from a societal perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microsimulation model that describes the natural history of lung cancer and incorporates several prevention strategies was developed. Discounted lifetime QALYs and costs at a rate of 3% were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, defined as additional costs in 2017 Euros per QALY gained. RESULTS: Smoking cessation interventions reduce the incidence of lung cancer by 8%-46% and are consistently more effective and cost-effective when starting at younger ages. Screening reduces lung cancer mortality by 1%-24% and is generally less effective and more costly than smoking cessation interventions. The most cost-effective strategy would be to implement intensive smoking cessation interventions at ages 35, 40 and 45, combined with screening every three years between the ages of 55 and 65. CONCLUSIONS: Combining smoking cessation interventions with LDCT screening is a very attractive prevention strategy that substantially diminishes the burden of lung cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microsimulation model that describes the natural history of lung cancer and incorporates several prevention strategies was developed. Discounted lifetime QALYs and costs at a rate of 3% were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, defined as additional costs in 2017 Euros per QALY gained. RESULTS: Smoking cessation interventions reduce the incidence of lung cancer by 8%-46% and are consistently more effective and cost-effective when starting at younger ages. Screening reduces lung cancer mortality by 1%-24% and is generally less effective and more costly than smoking cessation interventions. The most cost-effective strategy would be to implement intensive smoking cessation interventions at ages 35, 40 and 45, combined with screening every three years between the ages of 55 and 65. CONCLUSIONS: Combining smoking cessation interventions with LDCT screening is a very attractive prevention strategy that substantially diminishes the burden of lung cancer. These combined prevention strategies, especially when providing several intensive interventions for smoking cessation at early ages, are more cost-effective than both approaches separately and allow for a more intensified LDCT without losing efficiency.",2021-01-42039,34352591,Lung Cancer,Mireia Diaz,2021,159 /,153-161,No,34352591,"Mireia Diaz; Montse Garcia; Carmen Vidal; Albert Santiago; Gerard Gnutti; David Gómez; Marta Trapero-Bertran; Marcela Fu; Health and economic impact at a population level of both primary and secondary preventive lung cancer interventions: A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis., Lung Cancer, 2021 Sep; 159():; 153-161",QALY,Spain,Malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs,Screening,"thrice in a lifetime screening at 55, 60, 65 vs. no intervention",Not Stated,65 Years,35 Years,Male,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,25441,Euro,2017,31781.52

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A microsimulation model that describes the natural history of lung cancer and incorporates several prevention strategies was developed. Discounted lifetime QALYs and costs at a rate of 3% were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, defined as additional costs in 2017 Euros per QALY gained. RESULTS: Smoking cessation interventions reduce the incidence of lung cancer by 8%-46% and are consistently more effective and cost-effective when starting at younger ages. Screening reduces lung cancer mortality by 1%-24% and is generally less effective and more costly than smoking cessation interventions. The most cost-effective strategy would be to implement intensive smoking cessation interventions at ages 35, 40 and 45, combined with screening every three years between the ages of 55 and 65. CONCLUSIONS: Combining smoking cessation interventions with LDCT screening is a very attractive prevention strategy that substantially diminishes the burden of lung cancer. These combined prevention strategies, especially when providing several intensive interventions for smoking cessation at early ages, are more cost-effective than both approaches separately and allow for a more intensified LDCT without losing efficiency.",2021-01-42039,34352591,Lung Cancer,Mireia Diaz,2021,159 /,153-161,No,34352591,"Mireia Diaz; Montse Garcia; Carmen Vidal; Albert Santiago; Gerard Gnutti; David Gómez; Marta Trapero-Bertran; Marcela Fu; Health and economic impact at a population level of both primary and secondary preventive lung cancer interventions: A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis., Lung Cancer, 2021 Sep; 159():; 153-161",QALY,Spain,Malignant neoplasms of respiratory and intrathoracic organs,"Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical, Screening","thrice in a lifetime intensive smoking cessation intervention at 35, 40, 45 + twice in a lifetime screening at 55, 60 vs. thrice in a lifetime intensive smoking cessation intervention at 35, 40, 45 + once in a lifetime screening at 55",Not Stated,65 Years,35 Years,Male,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,13195,Euro,2017,16483.52
