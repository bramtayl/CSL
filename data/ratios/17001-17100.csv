17001,Cost effectiveness of a targeted age-based West Nile virus vaccination program,"BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of domestically-acquired arboviral disease in the United States. Several WNV vaccines are in various stages of development. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of WNV vaccination programs targeting groups at increased risk for severe WNV disease. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to estimate costs and health outcomes of vaccination with WNV vaccine compared to no vaccination among seven cohorts, spaced at 10year intervals from ages 10 to 70years, each followed until 90-years-old. U.S. surveillance data were used to estimate WNV neuroinvasive disease incidence. Data for WNV seroprevalence, acute and long-term care costs of WNV disease patients, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and vaccine characteristics were obtained from published reports. We assumed vaccine efficacy to either last lifelong or for 10years with booster doses given every 10years. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in cost-effectiveness ratios across cohorts in both models and all outcomes assessed (Kruskal-Wallis test p<0.0001). The 60-year-cohort had a mean cost per neuroinvasive disease case prevented of $664,000 and disability averted of $1,421,000 in lifelong model and $882,000 and $1,887,000, respectively in 10-year immunity model; these costs were statistically significantly lower than costs for other cohorts (p<0.0001). Vaccinating 70-year-olds had the lowest cost per death averted in both models at around $4.7 million (95%CI $2-$8 million). Cost per disease case averted was lowest among 40- and 50-year-old cohorts and cost per QALY saved lowest among 60-year cohorts in lifelong immunity model. The models were most sensitive to disease incidence, vaccine cost, and proportion of persons developing disease among infected.

17008,Cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared with piperacillin/tazobactam as empiric therapy based on the in-vitro surveillance of bacterial isolates in the United States for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections,"BACKGROUND: A challenge in the empiric treatment of complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) is identifying the initial appropriate antibiotic therapy (IAAT), which is associated with reduced length of stay and mortality compared with initial inappropriate antibiotic therapy (IIAT). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam compared with piperacillin/tazobactam (one of the standard of care antibiotics), for the treatment of hospitalized patients with cUTI. METHODS: A decision-analytic Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of empiric treatment with either ceftolozane/tazobactam or piperacillin/tazobactam in hospitalized adult patients with cUTI infected with Gram-negative pathogens in the US. The model applies the baseline prevalence of resistance as reported by national in-vitro surveillance data. RESULTS: In a cohort of 1000 patients, treatment with ceftolozane/tazobactam resulted in higher total costs compared with piperacillin/tazobactam ($36,413 /patient vs. $36,028/patient, respectively), greater quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) (9.19/patient vs. 9.13/patient, respectively) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $6128/QALY. Ceftolozane/tazobactam remained cost-effective at a willingness to pay of $100,000 per QALY compared to piperacillin/tazobactam over a range of input parameter values during one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

17009,Cost-Effectiveness of Exenatide twice daily versus Insulin Glargine as add-on Therapy to Oral Anti-diabetic Agents in Type 2 Diabetes in China,"AIMS: This study aimed to estimate long-term cost-effectiveness of exenatide twice daily (EBID) versus insulin glargine once daily (IGQD) as add-on therapy to oral anti-diabetic agents (OADs) for Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cardiff Diabetes Model was used to simulate disease progression and estimate long-term effects of EBID versus IGQD. Model-required patient profiles and treatment effects were obtained from literature reviews (English and Chinese databases) and meta-analysis of eight randomized clinical trials comparing EBID versus IGQD add-on to OADs for T2DM in China. Medical expenditure were mainly collected from 639 T2DM patients (>/=18 years) with and without complications incurred between 1/1/2014 and 12/31/2015 from claims databases in Shandong, China. From payers'' perspective, costs (2014 Chinese Yuan, yen) and benefits were estimated over 40 years at discount rate of 3%. A series of sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Patients on EBID+OAD had lower predicted incidences of most cardiovascular events and hypoglycemia events and lower total costs compared with those on IGQD+OAD. There were increased numbers of quality adjusted life years (QALY; 1.94) at a cost saving of yen117706 gained with EBID versus IGQD (i.e. cost saving of yen60764/QALY) per patient.

METHODS: The analysis used a decision tree to calculate the clinical effects and costs of AK first-line treatments, IM (2-3 days), diclofenac 3% (for 8 or 12 weeks), imiquimod 5% (for 4 or 8 weeks), during a 24-month horizon, using discrete intervals of 6 months. A hypothetical cohort of immunocompetent adult patients with clinically confirmed AK on the face and scalp or trunk and extremities was considered. Clinical data on the relative efficacy were obtained from a network meta-analysis. Inputs concerning resource use derived from an expert panel. All costs were calculated from a Greek third-party payer perspective. FINDINGS: IM 0.015% and 0.05% were both cost-effective compared with diclofenac and below a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (euro199 and euro167 per QALY, respectively). Comparing IM on the face and scalp AK lesions for 3 days versus imiquimod for 4 weeks resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of euro10,868 per QALY. IM was dominant during the 8-week imiquimod period. IM use on the trunk and extremities compared with diclofenac (8 or 12 weeks) led to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios estimated at euro1584 and euro1316 per QALY accordingly.

METHODS: The analysis used a decision tree to calculate the clinical effects and costs of AK first-line treatments, IM (2-3 days), diclofenac 3% (for 8 or 12 weeks), imiquimod 5% (for 4 or 8 weeks), during a 24-month horizon, using discrete intervals of 6 months.

17021,Cost-effectiveness analysis of ultrasonography screening for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in metabolic syndrome patients,"BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can be diagnosed early by noninvasive ultrasonography; however, the cost-effectiveness of ultrasonography screening with intensive weight reduction program in metabolic syndrome patients is not clear. This study aims to estimate economic and clinical outcomes of ultrasonography in Thailand. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis used decision tree and Markov models to estimate lifetime costs and health benefits from societal perspective, based on a cohort of 509 metabolic syndrome patients in Thailand. Data were obtained from published literatures and Thai database. Results were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2014 US dollars (USD) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with discount rate of 3%. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the influence of parameter uncertainty on the results. RESULTS: The ICER of ultrasonography screening of 50-year-old metabolic syndrome patients with intensive weight reduction program was 958 USD/QALY gained when compared with no screening. The probability of being cost-effective was 67% using willingness-to-pay threshold in Thailand (4848 USD/QALY gained). Screening before 45 years was cost saving while screening at 45 to 64 years was cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with metabolic syndromes, ultrasonography screening for NAFLD with intensive weight reduction program is a cost-effective program in Thailand. Study can be used as part of evidence-informed decision making. TRANSLATIONAL IMPACTS: Findings could contribute to changes of NAFLD diagnosis practice in settings where economic evidence is used as part of decision-making process.

17022,Cost-Effectiveness of Craniotomy for Epidural Hematomas at a Major Government Hospital in Cambodia,"BACKGROUND: Epidural hematoma (EDH) is a common and potentially deadly occurrence following a severe traumatic brain injury. Our aim was to determine whether craniotomy is cost-effective when indicated for the treatment of EDH when a trained neurosurgeon is available. METHODS: A decision tree was used to model the cost-effectiveness of craniotomy available versus craniotomy unavailable for the management of traumatic EDH from a Cambodian societal and provider perspective. Costs and effectiveness parameters were obtained from patient data at a large government hospital in Cambodia. Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental cost per QALY and budget impact were calculated for each intervention at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $9787.80/QALY (3x GDP per capita PPP). The time horizon reflected full life span, and costs and QALYs were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted. RESULTS: Compared to craniotomy unavailable for EDH ($945.80; 11.78 QALYs), craniotomy available came at a higher cost and greater effectiveness ($1520.73; 12.78 QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $574.93. One-way analysis demonstrated that craniotomy unavailable became more cost-effective than craniotomy available when the percent chance of having a GOS of 4 or 5 was 60% for patients with an EDH where craniotomy was indicated but not performed. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that craniotomy available was more cost-effective than conservative management in 84.4% of simulations at the WTP threshold.

17023,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors vs. ezetimibe through LDL-C reductions in a Norwegian setting,"Aims: Despite the success of statins, there remains unmet clinical need in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. New proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 55-65%. Two PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab and alirocumab, were approved for use in Norway but not yet for reimbursement through public national insurance. We aim to explore the cost-effectiveness of these compared to available treatments in a Norwegian setting. Methods and Results: A state transition Markov model was developed to model the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors for prevention of coronary heart disease, ischemic strokes and death among high-risk patient subpopulations in Norway, in both primary and secondary settings. Evolocumab and alirocumab are compared against ezetimibe and standard treatment. Risk of CVD is based on population incidence rates and adjusted according to baseline risk factors. Preventative effect of treatment was modelled according to absolute reduction in LDL-C. PCSK9 inhibitors were never found to be cost-effective in primary prevention. In secondary prevention they were cost-effective only for older, high-risk patients. The lowest cost-effectiveness ratios were for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients and high-risk diabetics, with euro63,200 and euro68,400 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. Conclusion: High lifetime costs of PCSK9 inhibitors may not be offset by estimated health gains for most eligible patients.

17024,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors vs. ezetimibe through LDL-C reductions in a Norwegian setting,"Aims: Despite the success of statins, there remains unmet clinical need in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. New proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 55-65%. Two PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab and alirocumab, were approved for use in Norway but not yet for reimbursement through public national insurance. We aim to explore the cost-effectiveness of these compared to available treatments in a Norwegian setting. Methods and Results: A state transition Markov model was developed to model the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors for prevention of coronary heart disease, ischemic strokes and death among high-risk patient subpopulations in Norway, in both primary and secondary settings. Evolocumab and alirocumab are compared against ezetimibe and standard treatment. Risk of CVD is based on population incidence rates and adjusted according to baseline risk factors. Preventative effect of treatment was modelled according to absolute reduction in LDL-C. PCSK9 inhibitors were never found to be cost-effective in primary prevention. In secondary prevention they were cost-effective only for older, high-risk patients. The lowest cost-effectiveness ratios were for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients and high-risk diabetics, with euro63,200 and euro68,400 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively.

17037,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors vs. ezetimibe through LDL-C reductions in a Norwegian setting,"Aims: Despite the success of statins, there remains unmet clinical need in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. New proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 55-65%. Two PCSK9 inhibitors, evolocumab and alirocumab, were approved for use in Norway but not yet for reimbursement through public national insurance. We aim to explore the cost-effectiveness of these compared to available treatments in a Norwegian setting. Methods and Results: A state transition Markov model was developed to model the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors for prevention of coronary heart disease, ischemic strokes and death among high-risk patient subpopulations in Norway, in both primary and secondary settings. Evolocumab and alirocumab are compared against ezetimibe and standard treatment. Risk of CVD is based on population incidence rates and adjusted according to baseline risk factors. Preventative effect of treatment was modelled according to absolute reduction in LDL-C. PCSK9 inhibitors were never found to be cost-effective in primary prevention. In secondary prevention they were cost-effective only for older, high-risk patients. The lowest cost-effectiveness ratios were for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients and high-risk diabetics, with euro63,200 and euro68,400 per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively.

METHODS: A Markov-model was constructed to simulate five-year medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data on clinical efficacy were obtained from randomised controlled trials. Country-specific unit costs, discount rates and a third-party payer perspective were applied. RESULTS: The bsIFX versus conventional therapy resulted in the most favourable incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) ranging from euro34,580 (Hungary) to euro77,062/QALY (Sweden).

17097,Cost-utility of biological treatment sequences for luminal Crohn's disease in Europe,"BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment sequences with available biologics, including adalimumab (ADA), biosimilar infliximab (bsIFX), originator infliximab (IFX) and vedolizumab (VEDO) for luminal Crohn''s disease in nine European countries. METHODS: A Markov-model was constructed to simulate five-year medical costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Data on clinical efficacy were obtained from randomised controlled trials. Country-specific unit costs, discount rates and a third-party payer perspective were applied. RESULTS: The bsIFX versus conventional therapy resulted in the most favourable incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) ranging from euro34,580 (Hungary) to euro77,062/QALY (Sweden). Compared to bsIFX, the bsIFX-ADA sequence was more cost-effective than the bsIFX-VEDO sequence with ICURs varying between euro70,277 (France) and euro162,069/QALY (Germany). The ICURs of the bsIFX-ADA-VEDO sequence versus the bsIFX-ADA strategy were between euro206,266 (The Netherlands) and euro363,232/QALY (Spain).
