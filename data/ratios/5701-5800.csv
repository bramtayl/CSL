5701,Cost effectiveness of drug-eluting stents in belgian practice: healthcare payer perspective,"There has been a steep increase in the number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed for coronary heart disease since their introduction about 30 years ago. Recently, the use of drug-eluting stents (DES) compared with the original bare metal stents (BMS) has increased in many countries. To assess the cost effectiveness of DES versus BMS in a real-world setting from the Belgian healthcare payer perspective. We developed a decision analysis model to estimate incremental costs (year 2004 or 2007 values [depending on the underlying variable]) and effectiveness. Incremental effectiveness was calculated by combining relative benefits from published meta-analyses with real-world observations from a Belgian registry. Probabilistic modelling and sensitivity analyses were performed. The model had a 1-year time horizon. Sixteen sub groups were created based on the following characteristics: initial stent type, diabetic status, complex lesion and multi-vessel disease. Scenario analyses were performed for the influence on reinterventions and the duration of clopidogrel use. In each analysis, 1000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed. The incremental costs for switching from BMS to DES are substantial (approximately euro1000), while the benefits, expressed as QALYs, are extremely small (on average <0.001 QALYs gained). This led to very high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: over euro860 000 per QALY gained in all subgroups and scenario analyses. Comparing DES with BMS, no life-years are gained and small quality-of-life improvements are achieved for short periods, resulting in a high likelihood that DES are not cost effective.

5712,New vaccines against otitis media: projected benefits and cost-effectiveness,"OBJECTIVE: New vaccines that offer protection against otitis media caused by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae and by Moraxella catarrhalis are under development. However, the potential health benefits and economic effects of such candidate vaccines have not been systematically assessed. METHODS: We created a computerized model to compare the projected benefits and costs of (1) the currently available 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, (2) a candidate pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine that has been tested in Europe, (3) a hypothetical pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine, and (4) no vaccination. The clinical probabilities of acute otitis media and of otitis media with effusion were generated from multivariate analyses of data from 2 large health maintenance organizations and from the Pittsburgh Child Development/Otitis Media Study cohort. Other probabilities, costs, and quality-of-life values were derived from published and unpublished sources. The base-case analysis assumed vaccine dose costs of $65 for the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, $100 for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine, and $125 for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine. RESULTS: With no vaccination, we projected that 13.7 million episodes of acute otitis media would occur annually in US children aged 0 to 4 years, at an annual cost of $3.8 billion. The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was projected to prevent 878,000 acute otitis media episodes, or 6.4% of those that would occur with no vaccination; the corresponding value for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine was 3.7 million (27%) and for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine was 4.2 million (31%). Using the base-case vaccine costs, pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine use would result in net savings compared with nontypeable 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate use. Conversely, pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine use would not result in savings compared with pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine use, but would cost $48 000 more per quality-adjusted life-year saved. The results were sensitive to variations in assumptions on vaccine effectiveness and vaccine dose costs but not to variations in other assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: New candidate vaccines against otitis media have the potential to prevent millions of disease episodes in the United States annually. If priced comparably with other recently introduced vaccines, these new otitis vaccines could achieve cost-effectiveness comparable with or more favorable than that of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine.",2009-01-04886,19482754,Pediatrics,Megan A O'Brien,2009,123 / 6,1452-63,No,19482754,"Megan A O'Brien; Lisa A Prosser; Jack L Paradise; G Thomas Ray; Martin Kulldorff; Marcia Kurs-Lasky; Virginia L Hinrichsen; Jyotsna Mehta; D Kathleen Colborn; Tracy A Lieu; New vaccines against otitis media: projected benefits and cost-effectiveness, Pediatrics, 2009-Jun; 123(6):1098-4275; 1452-63",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,7- valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine vs. No vaccination,Not Stated,4 Years,0 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,35000,United States,2006,44932.47

The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was projected to prevent 878,000 acute otitis media episodes, or 6.4% of those that would occur with no vaccination; the corresponding value for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine was 3.7 million (27%) and for the pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine was 4.2 million (31%). Using the base-case vaccine costs, pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine use would result in net savings compared with nontypeable 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate use. Conversely, pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae-Moraxella vaccine use would not result in savings compared with pneumococcal-nontypeable H influenzae vaccine use, but would cost $48 000 more per quality-adjusted life-year saved. The results were sensitive to variations in assumptions on vaccine effectiveness and vaccine dose costs but not to variations in other assumptions.

5717,Cost-effectiveness of an opportunistic screening programme and brief intervention for excessive alcohol use in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Effective prevention of excessive alcohol use has the potential to reduce the public burden of disease considerably. We investigated the cost-effectiveness of Screening and Brief Intervention (SBI) for excessive alcohol use in primary care in the Netherlands, which is targeted at early detection and treatment of 'at-risk' drinkers. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: We compared a SBI scenario (opportunistic screening and brief intervention for 'at-risk' drinkers) in general practices with the current practice scenario (no SBI) in The Netherlands. We used the RIVM Chronic Disease Model (CDM) to extrapolate from decreased alcohol consumption to effects on health care costs and Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was employed to study the effect of uncertainty in the model parameters. In total, 56,000 QALYs were gained at an additional cost of 298,000,000 euros due to providing alcohol SBI in the target population, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of 5,400 euros per QALY gained.

5718,Revisiting the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis with clotting factor for the treatment of severe haemophilia A,"Severe haemophilia A is a lifelong condition that requires treatment with exogenous clotting factor. While primary prophylaxis is the clinically preferred method of delivering treatment, its provision is costly. A 2002 evaluation of primary prophylaxis suggested an incremental cost-effectiveness of approximately 50,000 pounds per additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). However, since this time, preferable evaluative methods have been developed and means of assessing the value of future research also now exist. Thus, the primary aims of this study were to update a previously published cost-effectiveness analysis of primary prophylaxis vs. treating on-demand in terms of methods and to estimate the value of undertaking further primary research. The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was shown to be approximately 37,000 pounds, 10,000 pounds lower than the value published in 2002. The main reason for this difference was the use of different structural assumptions and methods to fit the various model parameters. At a willingness to pay per additional QALY threshold of 30,000 pounds, the probability prophylaxis is cost-effective was 13%. However, this increased to over 90% when alternative structural assumptions were employed, such as the rate at which future QALYs are discounted. The value of further research to increase the precision of this newly calculated cost-effectiveness estimate was high at a threshold willingness to pay values of 30,000- 40,000 pounds per QALY, particularly for the utilities associated with the health states. Thus, there is considerable value in conducting further primary research related to economic aspects of primary prophylaxis.",2009-01-04897,19473422,Haemophilia,A Miners,2009,15 / 4,881-7,No,19473422,"A Miners; Revisiting the cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis with clotting factor for the treatment of severe haemophilia A, Haemophilia, 2009-Jul; 15(4):1351-8216; 881-7",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylaxis vs. On demand treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,70 Years,6.00,0.00,38000,United Kingdom,2007,94960.47

5723,Is it cost effective to introduce paramedic practitioners for older people to the ambulance service? Results of a cluster randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: A scheme to train paramedics to undertake a greater role in the care of older people following a call for an emergency ambulance was developed in a large city in the UK. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost effectiveness of the paramedic practitioner (PP) scheme compared with usual emergency care. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial was undertaken of PP compared with usual care. Weeks were allocated to the study group at random to the PP scheme either being active (intervention) or inactive (control). Resource use data were collected from routine sources, and from patient-completed questionnaires for events up to 28 days. EQ-5D data were also collected at 28 days. RESULTS: Whereas the intervention group received more PP contact time, it reduced the proportion of emergency department (ED) attendances (53.3% vs 84.0%) and time in the ED (126.6 vs 211.3 minutes). There was also some evidence of increased use of health services in the days following the incident for patients in the intervention group. Overall, total costs in the intervention group were 140 UK pounds lower when routine data were considered (p = 0.63). When the costs and QALY were considered simultaneously, PP had a greater than 95% chance of being cost effective at 20 000 UK pounds per QALY. CONCLUSION: Several changes in resource use are associated with the use of PP. Given these economic results in tandem with the clinical, operational and patient-related benefits, the wider implementation and evaluation of similar schemes should be considered.",2009-01-04904,19465624,Emerg Med J,S Dixon,2009,26 / 6,446-51,No,19465624,"S Dixon; S Mason; E Knowles; B Colwell; J Wardrope; H Snooks; R Gorringe; J Perrin; J Nicholl; Is it cost effective to introduce paramedic practitioners for older people to the ambulance service?

5724,"Cost-effectiveness of warfarin: trial versus ""real-world"" stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous cost-effectiveness analyses analyzed warfarin for stroke prevention in randomized trial settings. Given the complexities of warfarin treatment, cost-effectiveness should be examined within a real-world setting. METHODS: Our model followed patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk of stroke through primary and recurrent ischemic stroke, hemorrhages--intracranial and extracranial, and the resulting disability. Four scenarios were examined: (1) all patients start on warfarin with perfect control, that is, international normalized ratio (INR) values always within range; (2) all patients start on warfarin with trial-like control, where INR can fall outside the recommended range; (3) all patients start on warfarin with real-world INR control; and (4) real-world prescription (and control) of warfarin, aspirin, or neither for warfarin-eligible patients. Reported warfarin discontinuation rates were used. Main outcomes were total number of events, quality adjusted life years, and costs in a US setting. RESULTS: The total number of primary and recurrent ischemic strokes in a 1,000-patient cohort (age 70 years, lifetime analysis) was 626, 832, 984, and 1,171 in scenarios 1 to 4, respectively.

Given the complexities of warfarin treatment, cost-effectiveness should be examined within a real-world setting. METHODS: Our model followed patients with atrial fibrillation at moderate to high risk of stroke through primary and recurrent ischemic stroke, hemorrhages--intracranial and extracranial, and the resulting disability. Four scenarios were examined: (1) all patients start on warfarin with perfect control, that is, international normalized ratio (INR) values always within range; (2) all patients start on warfarin with trial-like control, where INR can fall outside the recommended range; (3) all patients start on warfarin with real-world INR control; and (4) real-world prescription (and control) of warfarin, aspirin, or neither for warfarin-eligible patients. Reported warfarin discontinuation rates were used. Main outcomes were total number of events, quality adjusted life years, and costs in a US setting. RESULTS: The total number of primary and recurrent ischemic strokes in a 1,000-patient cohort (age 70 years, lifetime analysis) was 626, 832, 984, and 1,171 in scenarios 1 to 4, respectively.

5727,Solifenacin in the treatment of overactive bladder syndrome in Italian patients: pharmacoeconomic evaluation,"Abstract Objective: To investigate the pharmacoeconomic performance of treatment with solifenacin, a new antimuscarinic with selectivity for the bladder, when compared to tolterodine and placebo, in Italian patients with overactive bladder (OAB). Methods: The evaluation was performed using a Markov model. The time horizon of the simulation was 52 weeks, with 1-week cycles. The model simulated outcomes and costs of the treatment with solifenacin (5 mg/day), tolterodine ER (4 mg/day) and no treatment in a cohort representative of the Italian population with OAB. The analysis was conducted mainly from the perspective of the patient, since drugs for the treatment of OAB are not included in the Italian reimbursement list. A supplementary scenario explored the consequences of a hypothetical reimbursement decision by the Italian Health Service to reimburse half of the current retail price in incontinent and responding OAB patients only. Results: Both treatments produced a reduction in symptoms and improvement in patients' quality of life, with an cost increase of about euro540-640/patient/year with solifenacin and euro680-780/patient/year with tolterodine. In a cost/utility analysis, solifenacin dominated tolterodine as it resulted in both more effective and less costly treatment; the cost/utility ratio with respect to no treatment was in the range euro7,600-18,600/Quality-adjusted life year. The overall expenditure of the hypothesised reimbursement decision was estimated to be about 23 million euros, with a cost/utility ratio of about euro600-2,400/Quality-adjusted life year, indicating an efficient allocation of health resources.

5741,Model-based simulation to explore the cost-effectiveness of following practice guidelines for triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control among patients with diabetes mellitus and mixed dyslipidemia,"BACKGROUND: The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines recommend maintaining lipid levels within particular targets to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this simulation study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of following guideline-recommended care compared with current practice or usual care for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and mixed dyslipidemia (ie, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] and triglyceride [TG] levels). METHODS: A simulation model using a US health care payer perspective was designed to predict changes in lipid levels (LDL-C, TG, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol) and long-term CHD risk. Data about patients with DM and uncontrolled TG and/or LDL-C were taken from an electronic medical records database to develop the description of current care (eg, statin, fibrate, or no medication) and cholesterol levels. Patients with uncontrolled lipid levels who were not following guideline recommendations were assumed to be receiving combination treatment (ie, coadministration of statin and fibrate) or monotherapy for the uncontrolled lipids under guideline care. Results from a previous study were used to project incremental benefits of combination treatment compared with monotherapy. CHD events were predicted based on risk equations. A 20-year model of direct costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) was created. RESULTS: Among patients switched to guideline therapy, the model predicted 72% achieved 2 lipid targets and 44% achieved 3 lipid targets in 1 year. Over 20 years, in a modeled sample of 1000 patients, 176 myocardial infarction and angina events would be avoided by following guideline care. Total present value of costs for drug treatment and medical care for CHD events would be $33,626 per patient for guideline treatment versus $25,264 per patient for current care. The discounted QALY gain would be 0.18 per patient for an incremental cost per QALY of $50,315. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this model simulation suggest that for patients with DM and mixed dyslipidemia, following treatment guidelines rather than current practice (including combination therapy rather than monotherapy) would result in more patients achieving lipid targets, fewer CHD events, and more QALYs gained at a reasonable cost (less than $109,000) per QALY.",2009-01-04920,19446159,Clin Ther,Sonja V Sorensen,2009,31 / 4,862-79,Yes,19446159,"Sonja V Sorensen; Kevin D Frick; Alexander Wade; Robert Simko; Russel Burge; Model-based simulation to explore the cost-effectiveness of following practice guidelines for triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol control among patients with diabetes mellitus and mixed dyslipidemia, Clin Ther, 2009-Apr; 31(4):1879-114X; 862-79",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Guideline care vs. Current care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,50315,United States,2007,62804.81

Only a few studies, however, have compared the cost-effectiveness of a combination of cognitive behavioural therapy and antidepressant therapy versus antidepressant therapy alone. The purpose of the present study was therefore to analyse cost-effectiveness, from the perspective of the health-care system and also from a social perspective, comparing combined cognitive behavioural therapy + antidepressant therapy and antidepressant therapy alone in the Japanese setting.

METHOD: A 12-month Markov model was constructed that depicted the management of a chronic, non-healing VLU of over six months duration. The model considers the decision by a clinician to treat a recalcitrant VLU with amelogenin plus compression bandaging or compression bandaging alone, and was used to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of amelogenin plus compression bandaging at 20062007 prices. RESULTS: According to the model, 60% of all wounds treated with amelogenin plus compression bandaging are expected to heal within 12 months of the start of treatment compared with 41% of wounds treated with compression bandaging alone (p<0.01). Additionally, 23% of all amelogenin-treated wounds are expected to improve compared with 18% of wounds in the compression bandaging alone group. This difference in effectiveness between the two groups is expected to lead to a 7% improvement in health gain among amelogenin-treated patients when compared with those treated with compression bandaging alone (0.800 versus 0.746 QALYs; p<0.01) at 12 months after the start of treatment. Use of amelogenin is expected to lead a 10% reduction in NHS cost over 12 months from pound4,261 (95% CI: pound3,409; pound5,114) to pound3,816 (95% CI: pound3,227; pound4,405), due in part to a reduction in the requirement for nurse visits. Hence, amelogenin plus compression bandaging was found to be a dominant treatment. Moreover, use of amelogenin is expected to free-up NHS resources for alternative use within the system. CONCLUSION: Within the models limitations, amelogenin plus compression bandaging is expected to afford the NHS a cost-effective dressing compared with compression bandaging alone in the management of chronic non-healing VLUs of more than six months duration.

5752,Cost-effectiveness of a minimal intervention for stress-related sick leave in general practice: Results of an economic evaluation alongside a pragmatic randomised control trial,"BACKGROUND: Stress-related mental health problems negatively impact quality of life and productivity. Worldwide, treatment is often sought in primary care. Our objective was to determine whether a general practitioner-based minimal intervention for workers with stress-related sick leave (MISS) was cost-effective compared to usual care (UC). METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation from a societal perspective. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and resource use were measured by the EuroQol and cost diaries, respectively. Uncertainty was estimated by 95% confidence intervals, cost-effectiveness planes and acceptability curves. Sensitivity analyses and ancillary analyses based on preplanned subgroups were performed. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in costs or QALYs were observed. The mean incremental cost per QALY was -euro7356 and located in the southeast quadrant of the cost-effectiveness plane, whereby the intervention was slightly more effective and less costly. For willingness-to-pay (lambda) thresholds from euro0 to euro100,000, the probability of MISS being cost-effective was 0.58-0.90. For the preplanned subgroup of patients diagnosed with stress-related mental disorders, the incremental ratio was -euro28,278, again in the southeast quadrant. Corresponding probabilities were 0.92 or greater. LIMITATIONS: Non-significant findings may be related to poor implementation of the MISS intervention and low power. Also, work-presenteeism and unpaid labor were not measured. CONCLUSIONS: The minimal intervention was not cost-effective compared to usual care for a heterogeneous patient population. Therefore, we do not recommend widespread implementation. However, the intervention may be cost-effective for the subgroup stress-related mental disorders.

5754,A critical evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of radon protection methods in new homes in a radon affected area of England,"In the UK, building new homes in areas prone to radon gas is currently subject to regulations that require installation of radon-proof membranes. These membranes are not, however, the only way to protect residents of new homes against radon's potential to cause lung cancer. Alternative regulatory regimes can be constructed that would achieve the same end. The purpose of this paper is to examine the cost-effectiveness of four alternative regimes and so determine if building regulations for new homes could be altered to protect residents from the effects of radon more cost-effectively than at present. In addressing this question, the paper also contributes to the wider debate on how best to reduce the effect on public health of exposure to radon. The measure of cost-effectiveness used, cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained, is determined from radon test results obtained in properties in Brixworth, England, UK, a radon Affected Area. Confidence intervals for the cost-effectiveness estimates are also derived using bootstrap techniques. The central estimates of cost-effectiveness range from 2870 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the most cost-effective of the alternative regimes to 6182 pounds for the current regime. These results suggest that alternative regimes may be more cost-effective in tackling the radon problem.

5759,Cost-effectiveness of biological therapy for Crohn's disease: Markov cohort analyses incorporating United Kingdom patient-level cost data,"BACKGROUND: Anti-TNF-alpha agents for Crohn's disease (CD) have good clinical efficacy but high acquisition cost compared to rival drugs. AIM: To assess the cost-effectiveness of infliximab and adalimumab for Crohn's disease from the perspective of the UK NHS, incorporating recent trial and observational data. METHODS: Lifetime Markov analyses constructed to simulate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs. CD was represented by four health-states representing: Full response, partial response, nonresponse, surgery and death. The course of CD under standard care was based on the Olmsted county cohort. Systematic review identified ACCENT I (infliximab) and CHARM (adalimumab) as sources for efficacy data. We modelled an intention-to-treat strategy for biologics including surgical rates based on observational data, cost estimates from our UK dataset and utilities from an algorithm converting CDAI to EQ-5D utilities. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) compared to standard care for 1-year of treatment with infliximab or adalimumab were 19,050 pounds and 7190 pounds per QALY gained, respectively. Lifetime therapy was dominated by standard care. Analyses over shorter time horizons, matched to treatment duration, resulted in unfavourable ICERs.

5763,Computed tomographic coronary angiography for diagnosing stable coronary artery disease,"Background: To evaluate the lifetime potential benefits and cost-effectiveness of using 64 multidetector-row computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) as a noninvasive imaging modality for patients at risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods and Results: A decision and cost-effective analysis using a Markov model was performed to compare 4 strategies: (1) no examination, (2) routine coronary angiography (CAG), (3) CTCA, or (4) medication without CAG or CTCA in persons at risk for stable CAD. Compared with the no examination and no treatment strategies, CTCA gained 0.551 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$15,581 (in 2007) per QALY. Routine CAG gained 0.012 QALYs compared with the CTCA strategy, with an ICER of US$445,276 per QALY.

5765,Computed tomographic coronary angiography for diagnosing stable coronary artery disease,"Background: To evaluate the lifetime potential benefits and cost-effectiveness of using 64 multidetector-row computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) as a noninvasive imaging modality for patients at risk for coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods and Results: A decision and cost-effective analysis using a Markov model was performed to compare 4 strategies: (1) no examination, (2) routine coronary angiography (CAG), (3) CTCA, or (4) medication without CAG or CTCA in persons at risk for stable CAD. Compared with the no examination and no treatment strategies, CTCA gained 0.551 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$15,581 (in 2007) per QALY. Routine CAG gained 0.012 QALYs compared with the CTCA strategy, with an ICER of US$445,276 per QALY.

5766,Cost-effectiveness analysis of alternative first-trimester pregnancy termination strategies in Mexico City,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the comparative health and economic outcomes associated with three alternative first-trimester abortion techniques in Mexico City and to examine the policy implications of increasing access to safe abortion modalities within a restrictive setting. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: Mexico City. POPULATION: Reproductive-aged women with unintended pregnancy seeking first-trimester abortion. METHODS: Synthesising the best available data, a computer-based model simulates induced abortion and its potential complications and is used to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative safe modalities for first-trimester pregnancy termination: (1) hospital-based dilatation and curettage (D&C), (2) hospital-based manual vacuum aspiration (MVA), (3) clinic-based MVA and (4) medical abortion using vaginal misoprostol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of complications, lifetime costs, life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy. RESULTS: In comparison to the magnitude of health gains associated with all safe abortion modalities, the relative differences between strategies were more pronounced in terms of their economic costs. Assuming all options were equally available, clinic-based MVA was the least costly and most effective. Medical abortion with misoprostol provided comparable benefits to D&C, but cost substantially less. Enhanced access to safe abortion was always more influential than shifting between safe abortion modalities. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the provision of safe abortion is cost-effective and will result in reduced complications, decreased mortality and substantial cost savings compared with unsafe abortion.

5777,Cost-Effectiveness of Screening for Unhealthy Alcohol Use with %Carbohydrate Deficient Transferrin: Results From a Literature-Based Decision Analytic Computer Model,"Background: The %carbohydrate deficient transferrin (%CDT) test offers objective evidence of unhealthy alcohol use but its cost-effectiveness in primary care conditions is unknown. Methods: Using a decision tree and Markov model, we performed a literature-based cost-effectiveness analysis of 4 strategies for detecting unhealthy alcohol use in adult primary care patients: (i) Questionnaire Only, using a validated 3-item alcohol questionnaire; (ii) %CDT Only; (iii) Questionnaire followed by %CDT (Questionnaire-%CDT) if the questionnaire is negative; and (iv) No Screening. For those patients screening positive, clinicians performed more detailed assessment to characterize unhealthy use and determine therapy. We estimated costs using Medicare reimbursement and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. We determined sensitivity, specificity, prevalence of disease, and mortality from the medical literature. In the base case, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in 2006 dollars per quality-adjusted life year ($/QALY) for a 50-year-old cohort. Results: In the base case, the ICER for the Questionnaire-%CDT strategy was $15,500/QALY compared with the Questionnaire Only strategy. Other strategies were dominated.

5780,A cost-effectiveness analysis of pioglitazone plus metformin compared with rosiglitazone plus metformin from a third-party payer perspective in the US *,"ABSTRACT Objective: The long-term cost-effectiveness of using pioglitazone plus metformin (Actoplusmet dagger ) compared with rosiglitazone plus metformin (Avandamet double dagger ) in treating type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was assessed from a US third-party payer perspective. dagger Actoplusmet is a trade name of Takeda Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd., Deerfield, IL, USA double dagger Avandamet is a trade name of GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle, NC, USA Research design and methods: Clinical efficacy (change in HbA(1c) and lipids) and baseline cohort parameters were extracted from a 12-month, randomized clinical trial (Derosa et al., 2006) evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of pioglitazone versus rosiglitazone, both in addition to metformin, in adult T2DM patients with insufficient glucose control (n = 96). A Markov-based model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes over 35 years, discounted at 3% per annum. Costs for complications were taken from published sources. Base-case assumptions were assessed through several sensitivity analyses. Main outcome measures: Outcomes included incremental life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total direct medical costs, cumulative incidence of complications and associated costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: Compared to rosiglitazone plus metformin, pioglitazone plus metformin was projected to result in a modest improvement in 0.187 quality-adjusted life-years. Over patients' lifetimes, total direct medical costs were projected to be marginally lower with pioglitazone plus metformin (difference -$526.), largely due to reduced CVD complication costs. While costs were higher among renal, ulcer/amputation/neuropathy, and eye complications in the pioglitazone plus metformin group, the cost savings for CVD complications outweighed their economic impact. Pioglitazone plus metformin was found to be a dominant long-term treatment strategy in the US compared to rosiglitazone plus metformin. Sensitivity analyses showed findings to be robust under almost all scenarios, including short-term time horizons, 6% discounting, removal of individual lipid parameters, and modifications of patient cohort to more closely represent a US T2DM population. Pioglitazone plus metformin was no longer dominant with 0% discounting, with 25% reduction in its HbA(1c) effects, or with a 15% increase in its acquisition price. Conclusions: Under a range of assumptions and study limitations around cohorts, clinical effects, and treatment patterns, this long-term analysis showed that pioglitazone plus metformin, when compared to rosiglitazone plus metformin, was a dominant treatment strategy within the US payer setting. Results were driven by the combination of modest differences in QALYs and modest savings in total complication costs over 35 years.",2009-01-04953,19419339,Curr Med Res Opin,Meaghan St Charles,2009,/,,No,19419339,"Meaghan St Charles; Michael E Minshall; Bhavik J Pandya; Robert W Baran; Sandra L Tunis; A cost-effectiveness analysis of pioglitazone plus metformin compared with rosiglitazone plus metformin from a third-party payer perspective in the US *, Curr Med Res Opin, 2009-May-06; ():0300-7995",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pioglitazone plus metformin (Actoplusmet) vs. Rosiglitazone plus meformin (Avandamet),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,-2812.83,United States,2006,-3611.07
5781,An economic analysis of endoscopic ablative therapy for management of nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Advances have occurred in the development of safe and effective ablative therapies for Barrett's esophagus. The aim of the current study was to perform an economic analysis evaluating the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic ablation of nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus. METHODS: A Markov model evaluated three competing strategies in a hypothetical 50-year-old cohort with nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus from a societal perspective. Strategy I -- natural history of Barrett's disease (without surveillance); Strategy II -- surveillance performed according to the American College of Gastroenterology practice guidelines; Strategy III -- endoscopic ablative therapy. The model was biased against ablative therapy with a conservative estimate of complete response and continued standard surveillance even after complete ablation. All potential complications were accounted for, and an incomplete histological response after ablation was presumed to have the same risk of progression as untreated Barrett's. Transitional probabilities, discounted cost, and utility values to estimate quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were obtained from published information. Direct costs were used in our analysis. RESULTS: In baseline analysis, the ablative strategy yielded the highest QALY and was more cost-effective than endoscopic surveillance. In a Monte Carlo analysis, the relative risk of developing cancer in the strategy based on endoscopic ablation was decreased compared with the other strategies. In threshold analysis, the critical determinants of cost-effectiveness of the ablative strategy were rate of complete response to ablation, total cost of ablation, and risk of progression to dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limits of the model, ablation for nondysplastic Barrett's esophagus is more cost-effective than endoscopic surveillance.

5784,Cost-effectiveness of pioglitazone in type 2 diabetes patients with a history of macrovascular disease: a German perspective,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to project health-economic outcomes relevant to the German setting for the addition of pioglitazone to existing treatment regimens in patients with type 2 diabetes, evidence of macrovascular disease and at high risk of cardiovascular events. METHODS: Event rates corresponding to macrovascular outcomes from the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events (PROactive) study of pioglitazone were used with a modified version of the CORE Diabetes Model to simulate outcomes over a 35-year time horizon. Direct medical costs were accounted from a healthcare payer perspective in year 2005 values. Germany specific costs were applied for patient treatment, hospitalization and management. Both costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 5.0% per annum. RESULTS: Over patient lifetimes pioglitazone treatment improved undiscounted life expectancy by 0.406 years and improved quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.120 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared to placebo. Direct medical costs (treatment plus complication costs) were marginally higher for pioglitazone treatment and calculation of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) produced a value of euro13,294 per QALY gained with the pioglitazone regimen versus placebo. Acceptability curve analysis showed that there was a 78.2% likelihood that pioglitazone would be considered cost-effective in Germany, using a ""good value for money"" threshold of euro50,000 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results were most sensitive to changes in the simulation time horizon. After adjustment for the potential stabilization of pancreatic beta-cell function with pioglitazone treatment, the ICER was euro6,667 per QALY gained for pioglitazone versus placebo. CONCLUSION: The findings of this modelling analysis indicated that, for patients with a history of macrovascular disease, addition of pioglitazone to existing therapy reduces the long-term cumulative incidence of diabetes-complications at a cost that would be considered to represent good value for money in the German setting.",2009-01-04955,19416529,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Werner A Scherbaum,2009,7 /,9,Yes,19416529,"Werner A Scherbaum; Gordon Goodall; Katrina M Erny-Albrecht; Massimo Massi-Benedetti; Erland Erdmann; William J Valentine; Cost-effectiveness of pioglitazone in type 2 diabetes patients with a history of macrovascular disease: a German perspective, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2009; 7():1478-7547; 9",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pioglitazone vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,5.00,5.00,13294,Euro,2005,21931.1
5785,Cognitive behaviour therapy for improving social recovery in psychosis: cost-effectiveness analysis,"A randomised trial was conducted in order to estimate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of social recovery orientated cognitive behavioural therapy (SRCBT) for people diagnosed with psychosis, compared to case management alone (CMA). The mean incremental health and social care cost, and the mean incremental quality adjusted life year (QALY) gain, of SRCBT was calculated over the 9 month intervention period. The cost-effectiveness of SCRBT was in turn estimated, and considered in relation to the cost-effectiveness threshold of 20000 UK pounds per QALY. The level of uncertainty associated with that decision was estimated by calculating the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for SRCBT. N=35 received SRCBT and N=42 received CMA. The mean incremental cost was estimated to be 668 UK pounds, and the mean incremental QALY gain 0.035. SRCBT was estimated to be cost-effective as it had a cost per QALY of 18844 UK pounds, which was more favourable than the assumed cost-effectiveness threshold of 20000 UK pounds per QALY. At that threshold the probability of being cost-effective was however estimated to be 54.3% according to the CEAC, suggesting that further research may be warranted in order to reduce the level of uncertainty associated with the decision as to whether SRCBT is cost-effective.",2009-01-04971,19403270,Schizophr Res,Garry R Barton,2009,112 / 1-3,158-63,No,19403270,"Garry R Barton; Jo Hodgekins; Miranda Mugford; Peter B Jones; Tim Croudace; David Fowler; Jo Hodgekins; Miranda Mugford; Peter B Jones; Tim Croudace; David Fowler; Cognitive behaviour therapy for improving social recovery in psychosis: cost-effectiveness analysis, Schizophr Res, 2009-Jul; 112(1-3):1573-2509; 158-63",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Social recovery orientated cognitive behavioral therapy vs. Case management alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,9 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,18844,United Kingdom,2007,47090.4
5786,Illustrating economic evaluation of diagnostic technologies: comparing Helicobacter pylori screening strategies in prevention of gastric cancer in Canada,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to present an economic evaluation of diagnostic technologies using Helicobacter pylori screening strategies for the prevention of gastric cancer as an illustration. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to compare the lifetime cost and effectiveness of 4 potential strategies: no screening, the serology test by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the stool antigen test (SAT), and the (13)C-urea breath test (UBT) for the detection of H. pylori among a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 Canadian men aged 35 years. Special parameter consideration included the sensitivity and specificity of each screening strategy, which determined the model structure and treatment regimen. The primary outcome measured was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between the screening strategies and the no-screening strategy. Base-case analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed using the point estimates of the parameters and Monte Carlo simulations, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the no-screening strategy in the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $33,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for the ELISA, $29,800 per QALY for the SAT, and $50,400 per QALY for the UBT. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the no-screening strategy was more cost effective if the willingness to pay (WTP) was <$20,000 per QALY, while the SAT had the highest probability of being cost effective if the WTP was >$30,000 per QALY. Both the ELISA and the UBT were not cost-effective strategies over a wide range of WTP values.

CONCLUSION: Although the UBT had the highest sensitivity and specificity, either no screening or the SAT could be the most cost-effective strategy depending on the WTP threshold values from an economic perspective.

5790,Endoscopic versus surgical therapy for early cancer in Barrett's esophagus: a decision analysis,"BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy for early esophageal adenocarcinoma is associated with increased operative mortality and morbidity, but possibly a decreased recurrence rate compared with endoscopic therapy when using EMR and radiofrequency ablation. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of esophagectomy and endoscopic therapy in the treatment of early esophageal adenocarcinoma. DESIGN: Decision analysis model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: During the 5-year study period, endoscopic therapy cost $17,000.00 and yielded 4.88 quality-adjusted life years, compared with $28,000.00 and 4.59, respectively, for esophagectomy. Varying the recurrence rates of cancer or Barrett's esophagus metaplasia after endoscopic therapy did not change the overall outcome. The sensitivity analysis demonstrated, however, that the outcome depended on the rate of lymph node involvement and operative mortality. Under the best of circumstances in favor of esophagectomy, such as 2% operative mortality, no reduced quality of life after esophagectomy, and a low 5-year survival rate after recurrence of endoscopic ablation, the risk of positive lymph nodes still needed to exceed 25% before esophagectomy became the preferred treatment option. This threshold is twice as high as the values reported for early submucosal cancer invasion. LIMITATIONS: Limited data are available about the long-term outcome of EMR and radiofrequency ablation. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic therapy for early Barrett's esophagus adenocarcinoma is more effective and less expensive than esophagectomy. Even in early esophageal adenocarcinoma with submucosal invasion, endoscopic therapy is a cost-effective alternative to esophagectomy, especially in patients with a high operative risk.",2009-01-04989,19394011,Gastrointest Endosc,Heiko Pohl,2009,/,,No,19394011,"Heiko Pohl; Amnon Sonnenberg; Sebastian Strobel; Alexander Eckardt; Thomas Rösch; Endoscopic versus surgical therapy for early cancer in Barrett's esophagus: a decision analysis, Gastrointest Endosc, 2009-Apr-24; ():0016-5107",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Esophagectomy vs. Endoscopic therapy,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,Male,Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-35937.93,United States,2007,-44858.89
5791,Health economic comparison between continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and multiple daily injections of insulin for the treatment of adult type 1 diabetes in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) may be treated with insulin via multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the projected long-term cost-effectiveness of CSII compared with MDI by modeling a simulated sample of adult patients with type 1 DM in Canada. METHODS: A health economic model was used to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of CSII compared with MDI from the perspective of a Canadian provincial government. The primary input variable was change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)). A series of Markov constructs also simulated the progression of disease-related complications. Annual acquisition costs for CSII and MDI were year-2006 Can $6347.18 and Can $4649.69, respectively. A 60-year time horizon and a discount rate of 5.0% per annum on costs and clinical outcomes were used. RESULTS: Mean direct lifetime costs were Can $15,591 higher with CSII treatment than MDI. Treatment with CSII was associated with an improvement in discounted life expectancy of 0.655 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over a 60-year time horizon, compared with MDI (mean [SD], 10.029 [0.133] vs 9.374 [0.076] QALYs). ICERs were Can $27,264 per life-year gained and Can $23,797 per QALY for CSII compared with MDI. The results were most sensitive to HbA(1c) assumptions.

5792,Cost-utility analysis of screening and laser treatment of retinopathy of prematurity,"PURPOSE: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major cause of lifelong blindness beginning in infancy. Utility analysis is used to describe the effect of illness and medical intervention on an individual's quality of life during the course of a lifetime. In this study, cost-utility analysis is used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of both screening and laser photoablation for ROP. METHODS: Data from 2 neonatal intensive care units were recorded for infants screened and treated for ROP between March 4, 2004, and January 5, 2006. The cost model was developed using procedures classified by Current Procedural Terminology and the costs paid for by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for 2006. Visual acuities were obtained from 10-year post-laser data and from the 10-year post-CRYO-ROP untreated cohort. RESULTS: During the study period, 515 infants received screening and treatment for ROP. They required a mean 3.4 exams per infant; 11.2% received laser photoablation. Mean visual acuities were 0.5 (Snellen 20/40) for laser-treated eyes and 0.20 (Snellen 20/100) for those who did not receive treatment. The cost-effectiveness of screening and laser photoablation of ROP in 2006 is $650/quality-adjusted life years. When discounted 3% per year for the time value of money, the cost is $1,565/ quality-adjusted life years.

5795,Cost-effectiveness of additional hepatitis B virus nucleic acid testing of individual donations or minipools of six donations in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: To further reduce the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) transmission by blood transfusion, nucleic acid testing (NAT) can be employed. The aim of this study is to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in the Netherlands of employing a triplex NAT assay aimed at HBV nucleic acid detection in individual donations (ID-NAT) or in minipools of 6 donations (MP-6-NAT), compared to a triplex NAT assay in minipools of 24 donations (MP-24-NAT). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A mathematical model was made of the whole transfusion chain from donors to recipients of blood in the Netherlands. The annual number of avoided HBV transmissions was estimated with the window-period incidence model. The natural history of a HBV infection in recipients is described by a Markov model. RESULTS: The ICER of adding HBV MP-6-NAT or HBV ID-NAT in the Netherlands is Euro303,218 (95% confidence interval [CI], Euro233,001-Euro408,388) and Euro518,995 (95% CI, Euro399,359-Euro699,120) per quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. The ICER strongly correlates with the age of transfusion recipients. CONCLUSION: The cost-effectiveness of additional HBV NAT is limited by the limited loss of life caused by HBV transmission.

In this unit, medical, nursing, occupational therapy and physiotherapy students are given responsibility, under supervision by trained and motivated personnel, for rehabilitation and care of patients in a subunit of an orthopaedic department. The aim of this study was to see whether the ITU was cost effective in treating patients compared with a conventional orthopaedic ward. One-hundred and thirty-four patients admitted for primary hip or knee replacement surgery were included in the study. All costs were recorded in the ITU and in the conventional ward. Follow-up was done by a quality of life questionnaire three months after the operation. Comparison was done by univariable and multivariable testing of costs and effect. In both, the ITU was more cost effective than the conventional ward. No difference was found in complications and patient-reported quality of life.

DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was constructed. METHODS: Costs and effects were evaluated for the three treatment options in a one-year timeframe. Costs included were treatment costs, cost of pad use, and patients productivity loss based on data from the Nordic countries. SAMPLE: Results from two randomized controlled trials were used as input data in the cost-effectiveness analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: Solifenacin flexible dosing was more effective with respect to reducing OAB symptoms compared to both placebo and tolterodine 4 mg. Treatment with both solifenacin and tolterodine was more costly compared to placebo, but treatment with solifenacin was a less costly alternative compared to tolterodine 4 mg SR. Sensitivity analyses revealed that the conclusions were robust.
