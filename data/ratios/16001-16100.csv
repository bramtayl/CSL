16001,Bariatric surgery for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: A clinical and cost-effectiveness analysis,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) affects 2%-3% of the US population and is expected to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in the next decade. Bariatric surgery may be an effective but expensive treatment for NASH. Using a state-transition model, our analysis assessed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surgery to manage NASH. We simulated the benefits and harms of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery in patients defined by weight class (overweight, mild obesity, moderate obesity, and severe obesity) and fibrosis stage (F0-F3). Comparators included intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and no treatment. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Our results showed that surgery and ILI in obese patients (with F0-F3) increased QALYs by 0.678-2.152 and 0.452-0.618, respectively, compared with no treatment. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for surgery in all F0-F3 patients with mild, moderate, or severe obesity were $48,836/QALY, $24,949/QALY, and $19,222/QALY, respectively. In overweight patients (with F0-F3), surgery increased QALYs by 0.050-0.824 and ILI increased QALYs by 0.031-0.164. In overweight patients, it was cost-effective to reserve treatment only for F3 patients; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for providing surgery or ILI only to F3 patients were $30,484/QALY and $25,367/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Surgery was both effective and cost-effective for obese patients with NASH, regardless of fibrosis stage; in overweight patients, surgery increased QALYs for all patients regardless of fibrosis stage, but was cost-effective only for patients with F3 fibrosis; our results highlight the promise of bariatric surgery for treating NASH and underscore the need for clinical trials in this area.

16012,Cost-Effectiveness of Saxagliptin versus Acarbose as Second-Line Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes in China,"OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the long-term cost-effectiveness of saxagliptin+metformin (SAXA+MET) versus acarbose+metformin (ACAR+MET) in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) inadequately controlled on MET alone. METHODS: Systematic literature reviews were performed to identify studies directly comparing SAXA+MET versus ACAR+MET, and to obtain diabetes-related events costs which were modified by hospital surveys. A Cardiff Diabetes Model was used to estimate the long-term economic and health treatment consequences in patients with T2DM. Costs (2014 Chinese yuan) were calculated from the payer''s perspective and estimated over a patient''s lifetime. RESULTS: SAXA+MET predicted lower incidences of most cardiovascular events, hypoglycemia events and fatal events, and decreased total costs compared with ACAR+MET. For an individual patient, the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with SAXA+MET was 0.48 more than ACAR+MET at a cost saving of yen18,736, which resulted in a cost saving of yen38,640 per QALY gained for SAXA+MET versus ACAR+MET. Results were robust across various univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: SAXA+MET is a cost-effective treatment alternative compared with ACAR+MET for patients with T2DM in China, with a little QALYs gain and lower costs. SAXA is an effective, well-tolerated drug with a low incidence of adverse events and ease of administration; it is anticipated to be an effective second-line therapy for T2DM treatment.",2016-01-21633,27875596,PLoS One,Shuyan Gu,2016,11 / 11,e0167190,No,27875596,"Shuyan Gu; Yuhang Zeng; Demin Yu; Xiaoqian Hu; Hengjin Dong; Cost-Effectiveness of Saxagliptin versus Acarbose as Second-Line Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes in China, PLoS One , 2016; 11(11):1932-6203; e0167190",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Saxagliptin (SAXA) + Metformin (MET) vs. Acarbose (ACAR) + Metformin (MET),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-39033.34,China,2014,-6925.86
16013,Cost effectiveness of using cognitive screening tests for detecting dementia and mild cognitive impairment in primary care,"INTRODUCTION: We estimated the cost effectiveness of different cognitive screening tests for use by General Practitioners (GPs) to detect cognitive impairment in England. METHODS: A patient-level cost-effectiveness model was developed using a simulated cohort that represents the elderly population in England (65 years and older). Each patient was followed over a lifetime period. Data from published sources were used to populate the model. The costs include government funded health and social care, private social care and informal care. Patient health benefit was measured and valued in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). RESULTS: Base-case analyses found that adopting any of the three cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, 6-Item Cognitive Impairment Test or GPCOG (General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition)) delivered more QALYs for patients over their lifetime and made savings across sectors including healthcare, social care and informal care compared with GP unassisted judgement. The benefits were due to early access to medications. Among the three cognitive tests, adopting the GPCOG was considered the most cost-effective option with the highest Incremental Net Benefit (INB) at the threshold of pound30 000 per QALY from both the National Health Service and Personal Social Service (NHS PSS) perspective ( pound195 034 per 1000 patients) and the broader perspective that includes private social care and informal care ( pound196 251 per 1000 patients). Uncertainty was assessed in both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our analyses indicate that the use of any of the three cognitive tests could be considered a cost-effective strategy compared with GP unassisted judgement.

16016,Economic Burden of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in the Era of Oral Targeted Therapies in the United States,"Purpose Oral targeted therapies represent a significant advance for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); however, their high cost has raised concerns about affordability and the economic impact on society. Our objective was to project the future prevalence and cost burden of CLL in the era of oral targeted therapies in the United States. Methods We developed a simulation model that evaluated the evolving management of CLL from 2011 to 2025: chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) as the standard of care before 2014, oral targeted therapies for patients with del(17p) and relapsed CLL from 2014, and for first-line treatment from 2016 onward. A comparator scenario also was simulated where CIT remained the standard of care throughout. Disease progression and survival parameters for each therapy were based on published clinical trials. Results The number of people living with CLL in the United States is projected to increase from 128,000 in 2011 to 199,000 by 2025 (55% increase) due to improved survival; meanwhile, the annual cost of CLL management will increase from $0.74 billion to $5.13 billion (590% increase). The per-patient lifetime cost of CLL treatment will increase from $147,000 to $604,000 (310% increase) as oral targeted therapies become the first-line treatment. For patients enrolled in Medicare, the corresponding total out-of-pocket cost will increase from $9,200 to $57,000 (520% increase). Compared with the CIT scenario, oral targeted therapies resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $189,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusion The increased benefit and cost of oral targeted therapies is projected to enhance CLL survivorship but can impose a substantial financial burden on both patients and payers. More sustainable pricing strategies for targeted therapies are needed to avoid financial toxicity to patients.",2016-01-21641,27870563,J Clin Oncol,Qiushi Chen,2017,35 / 2,JCO2016682856,No,27870563,"Qiushi Chen; Nitin Jain; Turgay Ayer; William G Wierda; Christopher R Flowers; Susan M O'Brien; Michael J Keating; Hagop M Kantarjian; Jagpreet Chhatwal; Economic Burden of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia in the Era of Oral Targeted Therapies in the United States, J Clin Oncol, 2017 Jan 10; 35(2):0732-183X; JCO2016682856",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral targeted therapy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Chemoimmunotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,189000,United States,2015,206378.78
16018,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Second-Line Chemotherapy Agents for Advanced Gastric Cancer,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Gastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy and second leading cause of cancer-related mortality. Chemotherapy options for patients who fail first-line treatment are limited. Thus the objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of second-line treatment options for patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model to compare the cost-effectiveness of six possible second-line treatment options for patients with advanced gastric cancer who have failed previous chemotherapy: irinotecan, docetaxel, paclitaxel, ramucirumab, paclitaxel plus ramucirumab, and palliative care. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The model was performed from a third-party payer''s perspective to compare lifetime costs and health benefits associated with studied second-line therapies. Costs included only relevant direct medical costs. The model assumed chemotherapy cycle lengths of 30 days and a maximum number of 24 cycles. Systematic review of literature was performed to identify clinical data sources and utility and cost data. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. The primary outcome measure for this analysis was the ICER between different therapies, where the incremental cost was divided by the number of QALYs saved. The ICER was compared with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold that was set at $50,000/QALY gained, and an exploratory analysis using $160,000/QALY gained was also used. The model''s robustness was tested by using 1-way sensitivity analyses and a 10,000 Monte Carlo simulation probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Irinotecan had the lowest lifetime cost and was associated with a QALY gain of 0.35 year. Docetaxel, ramucirumab alone, and palliative care were dominated strategies. Paclitaxel and the combination of paclitaxel plus ramucirumab led to higher QALYs gained, at an incremental cost of $86,815 and $1,056,125 per QALY gained, respectively. Based on our prespecified WTP threshold, our base case analysis demonstrated that irinotecan alone is the most cost-effective regimen, and both paclitaxel alone and the combination of paclitaxel and ramucirumab were not cost-effective (ICER more than $50,000). Both 1-way sensitivity analyses and PSA demonstrated the model''s robustness. PSA illustrated that paclitaxel plus ramucirumab was extremely unlikely to be cost-effective at a WTP threshold less than $400,000/QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Irinotecan alone appears to be the most cost-effective second-line regimen for patients with gastric cancer.

16022,Preventing postnatal maternal mental health problems using a psychoeducational intervention: the cost-effectiveness of What Were We Thinking,"OBJECTIVES: Postnatal maternal mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, entail a significant burden globally, and finding cost-effective preventive solutions is a public policy priority. This paper presents a cost-effectiveness analysis of the intervention, What Were We Thinking (WWWT), for the prevention of postnatal maternal mental health problems. DESIGN: The economic evaluation, including cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses, was conducted alongside a cluster-randomised trial. SETTING: 48 Maternal and Child Health Centres in Victoria, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were English-speaking first-time mothers attending participating Maternal and Child Health Centres. Full data were collected for 175 participants in the control arm and 184 in the intervention arm. INTERVENTION: WWWT is a psychoeducational intervention targeted at the partner relationship, management of infant behaviour and parental fatigue. OUTCOME MEASURES: The evaluation considered public sector plus participant out-of-pocket costs, while outcomes were expressed in the 30-day prevalence of depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Incremental costs and outcomes were estimated using regression analyses to account for relevant sociodemographic, prognostic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: The intervention was estimated to cost $A118.16 per participant. The analysis showed no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups in costs or outcomes. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $A36 451 per QALY gained and $A152 per percentage-point reduction in 30-day prevalence of depression, anxiety and adjustment disorders. The estimate lies under the unofficial cost-effectiveness threshold of $A55 000 per QALY; however, there was considerable uncertainty surrounding the results, with a 55% probability that WWWT would be considered cost-effective at that threshold. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, although WWWT shows promise as a preventive intervention for postnatal maternal mental health problems, further research is required to reduce the uncertainty over its cost-effectiveness as there were no statistically significant differences in costs or outcomes.

SETTING: 36 primary care general practices in North West England. PARTICIPANTS: 387 participants completed baseline assessment (collaborative care: 191; usual care: 196) and full or partial 4-month follow-up data were captured for 350 (collaborative care: 170; usual care: 180). 62% of participants were male, 14% were non-white. Participants were aged >/=18 years, listed on a Quality and Outcomes Framework register for CHD and/or type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, with persistent depressive symptoms. Patients with psychosis or type I/II bipolar disorder, actively suicidal, in receipt of services for substance misuse, or already in receipt of psychological therapy for depression were excluded. INTERVENTION: Collaborative care consisted of evidence-based low-intensity psychological treatments, delivered over 3 months and case management by a practice nurse and a Psychological Well Being Practitioner. OUTCOME MEASURES: As planned, the primary measure of cost-effectiveness was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)). A Markov model was constructed to extrapolate the trial results from short-term to long-term (24 months). RESULTS: The mean cost per participant of collaborative care was pound317 (95% CI 284 to 350). Over 24 months, it was estimated that collaborative care was associated with greater healthcare usage costs (net cost pound674 (95% CI -30 953 to 38 853)) and QALYs (net QALY gain 0.04 (95% CI -0.46 to 0.54)) than usual care, resulting in a cost per QALY gained of pound16 123, and a likelihood of being cost-effective of 0.54 (willingness to pay threshold of pound20 000). CONCLUSIONS: Collaborative care is a potentially cost-effective long-term treatment for depression in patients with comorbid physical and mental illness. The estimated cost per QALY gained was below the threshold recommended by English decision-makers. Further, long-term primary research is needed to address uncertainty associated with estimates of cost-effectiveness.

16028,Cost-Effectiveness of Lumbar Spondylolisthesis Surgery at 2-Year Follow-up,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of the operative treatment of lumbar spondylolisthesis and identify factors associated with cost-effectiveness at 2 years. METHODS: We evaluated patients who underwent surgery for spondylolisthesis. The QALY was determined from the EQ5D. Outcomes were also assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Surgical, neuromonitoring, and anesthesia Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes as well as hospital Diagnosis-Related Group codes were used to determine the Medicare direct care costs of surgery. Indirect costs were modeled based on existing literature. A discounting rate of 3% was applied. Analysis was performed to determine which factors were associated with a cost/QALY less than $100,000. RESULTS: There were 44 patients who underwent surgery for either degenerative (30) or isthmic spondylolisthesis (14). There were 27 women and 17 men, with an average age at surgery of 59.7 years (standard deviation [SD] = 14.69) and an average follow-up of 2 years (SD = 0.82). The average postoperative improvement in ODI was 24.77 (SD = 23.9), and change in QALY was 0.43 (SD = 0.30). The average cost/QALY at 2 years for direct care costs was $89,065. The average cost/QALY at 2 years for direct plus indirect costs was $112,588. Higher preoperative leg pain and greater leg pain change was associated with a cost/QALY <$100,000 (p < .005, p < .028). The cost-effective group had a higher proportion of patients with disease extent of two or more levels (p = .021). When comparing surgical techniques of anterior-posterior and posterior only, there was no difference in cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Spondylolisthesis surgery is cost-effective at 2 years, with a QALY change of 0.43 and a direct cost/QALY of $89,065. Higher preoperative leg pain and larger extent of disease was associated with cost-effectiveness.

16029,Nilotinib versus dasatinib as second-line therapy in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib: a cost-effectiveness analysis based on real-world data,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of second-line nilotinib vs dasatinib among patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib, from a US third-party perspective. METHODS: A lifetime partitioned survival model was developed to compare the costs and effectiveness of nilotinib vs dasatinib, which included four health states: CP on treatment, CP post-discontinuation, progressive disease (accelerated phase [AP] or blast crisis [BC]), and death. Time on treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival of nilotinib and dasatinib were estimated using real-world comparative effectiveness data. Parametric survival models were used to extrapolate outcomes beyond the study period. Drug treatment costs, medical costs, and adverse event costs were obtained from the literature and publicly available databases. Utilities of health states were derived from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, including incremental cost per life-year (LY) gained and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, were estimated comparing nilotinib and dasatinib. Deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying patient characteristics, cost, and utility inputs. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, nilotinib-treated patients were associated with 11.7 LYs, 9.1 QALYs, and a total cost of $1,409,466, while dasatinib-treated patients were associated with 9.5 LYs, 7.3 QALYs, and a total cost of $1,422,122. In comparison with dasatinib, nilotinib was associated with better health outcomes (by 2.2 LYs and 1.9 QALYs) and lower total costs (by $12,655). Deterministic sensitivity analysis results showed consistent findings in most scenarios. LIMITATIONS: In the absence of long-term real-world data, the lifetime projection could not be validated. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with dasatinib, second-line nilotinib was associated with better life expectancy, better quality-of-life, and lower costs among patients with Ph+ CML-CP who were resistant or intolerant to imatinib.",2016-01-21683,27841717,J Med Econ,Nanxin Li,2017,20 / 4,1-9,Yes,27841717,"Nanxin Li; Xi Yang; Liangyi Fan; Todor Totev; Annie Guerin; Lei Chen; Subrata Bhattacharyya; George Joseph; Nilotinib versus dasatinib as second-line therapy in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib: a cost-effectiveness analysis based on real-world data, J Med Econ, 2017 Apr; 20(4):1369-6998; 1-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Nilotinib vs. Dasatinib,Resistant or intolerant to Imatinib,Not Stated,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-7031.11,United States,2015,-7677.63

We have performed a new economic evaluation of AP on the basis of contemporary estimates of efficacy, adverse events, and resource implications. METHODS: A decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was used. Health service costs and benefits (measured as quality-adjusted life-years) were estimated. Rates of IE before and after the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance were available to estimate prophylactic efficacy. AP adverse event rates were derived from recent UK data, and resource implications were based on English Hospital Episode Statistics. RESULTS: AP was less costly and more effective than no AP for all patients at risk of IE. The results are sensitive to AP efficacy, but efficacy would have to be substantially lower for AP not to be cost-effective. AP was even more cost-effective in patients at high risk of IE. Only a marginal reduction in annual IE rates (1.44 cases in high-risk and 33 cases in all at-risk patients) would be required for AP to be considered cost-effective at pound20 000 ($26 600) per quality-adjusted life-year. Annual cost savings of pound5.5 to pound8.2 million ($7.3-$10.9 million) and health gains >2600 quality-adjusted life-years could be achieved from reinstating AP in England.

16034,"The cost-effectiveness of nonoperative management versus laparoscopic appendectomy for the treatment of acute, uncomplicated appendicitis in children","BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated the safety and short-term success of nonoperative management in children with acute, uncomplicated appendicitis. Nonoperative management spares the patients and their family the upfront cost and discomfort of surgery, but also risks recurrent appendicitis. METHODS: Using decision-tree software, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of nonoperative management versus routine laparoscopic appendectomy. Model variables were abstracted from a review of the literature, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and Medicare Physician Fee schedule. Model uncertainty was assessed using both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We used a $100,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) threshold for cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Operative management cost $11,119 and yielded 23.56 quality-adjusted life months (QALMs). Nonoperative management cost $2277 less than operative management, but yielded 0.03 fewer QALMs. The incremental cost-to-effectiveness ratio of routine laparoscopic appendectomy was $910,800 per QALY gained. This greatly exceeds the $100,000/QALY threshold and was not cost-effective. One-way sensitivity analysis found that operative management would become cost-effective if the 1-year recurrence rate of acute appendicitis exceeded 39.8%.

16035,Screening for and Treating Postpartum Depression and Psychosis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Objectives Postpartum depression impacts 6.5-12.9% of U.S. women. Postpartum depression is associated with impaired bonding and development, marital discord, suicide, and infanticide. However, the current standard of care is to not screen women for postpartum depression. This study modeled the cost-effectiveness of physicians screening for and treating postpartum depression and psychosis in partnership with a psychiatrist. Methods This study follows a hypothetical cohort of 1000 pregnant women experiencing one live birth over a 2-year time horizon. We used a decision tree model to obtain the outcomes of screening for and treating postpartum depression and psychosis using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. We use a Medicaid payer perspective because they cover approximately 50% of births in the U.S. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is measured in cost per remission achieved and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. We conducted both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results Screening for and treating postpartum depression and psychosis produced 29 more healthy women at a cost of $943 per woman. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the intervention branch compared to usual care were $13,857 per QALY gained (below the commonly accepted willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY gained) and $10,182 per remission achieved. These results were robust in both the deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses of input parameters. Conclusions for Practice Screening for and treating postpartum depression is a cost-effective intervention and should be considered as part of usual postnatal care, which aligns with the recently proposed recommendations from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.",2016-01-21701,27832444,Matern Child Health J,Andra Wilkinson,2017,21 / 4,,No,27832444,"Andra Wilkinson; Seri Anderson; Stephanie B Wheeler; Screening for and Treating Postpartum Depression and Psychosis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Matern Child Health J, 2017 Apr; 21(4):1573-6628",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Postpartum depression (PPD) screening and treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care,Experienced one birth in the past year,49 Years,18 Years,Female,Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,13857,United States,2014,15149.13
16036,"Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Fluorouracil, Leucovorin, and Irinotecan versus Epirubicin, Cisplatin, and Capecitabine in Patients with Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma","No standard treatment has been accepted widely for the first-/second-line therapy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The current study aimed to determine a preferred strategy between FOLFIRI (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan) and ECX (epirubicin, cisplatin,and capecitabine) for AGC from the cost-effectiveness perspective. According to a French intergroup study, two groups (ECX arm and FOLFIRI arm) and three health states (progression-free survival (PFS), progressive disease (PD) and death) were analyzed in the current Markov model. All the medical costs were calculated from a Chinese societal perspective. Although FOLFIRI was an acceptable first-line therapy in the treatment of AGC with a better time-to treatment failure (TTF) compared to ECX, ECX arm (ECX followed by FOLFIRI) gained 0.08 quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) more effectiveness benefit compared with FOLFIRI arm (FOLFIRI followed by ECX). Additionally, a lower cost was found in ECX arm ($23,813.13 versus $24,983.70). Hence, the strategy of FOLFIRI arm is dominated by ECX arm ($4,125.8 per QALM in FOLIRI arm; $3,879.724 per QALM in ECX arm).

This study assesses long-term clinical and economic outcomes of peginterferon beta-1a compared with other self-injectable DMTs (interferon beta-1a [22 mcg, 30 mcg, and 44 mcg], interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate 20 mg) in the treatment of RRMS, from the National Health Service and Personal Social Services perspective in Scotland. METHODS: A previously published, validated Markov cohort model was adapted for this analysis. The model estimates changes in patient disability, occurrence of relapses, and other adverse events, and translates them into quality-adjusted life years and costs. Natural history data came from the ADVANCE trial of peginterferon beta-1a, the London Ontario (Canada) database, and a large population-based MS survey in the UK. The comparative efficacy of each DMT vs placebo was obtained from a network meta-analysis. Costs (2015 British Pounds) were obtained from public databases and literature. Clinical and economic outcomes were projected over 30 years and discounted at 3.5% per year. RESULTS: Over 30 years, peginterferon beta-1a was dominant compared with interferon beta-1a (22, 30, and 44 mcg), and interferon beta-1b, and cost-effective compared with glatiramer acetate 20 mg. Results were most sensitive to variations in each DMT''s efficacy and acquisition costs. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.

16042,Hepatitis C disease transmission and treatment uptake: impact on the cost-effectiveness of new direct-acting antiviral therapies,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment can reduce the incidence of future infections through removing opportunities for onward transmission. This benefit is not captured in conventional cost-effectiveness evaluations of treatment and is particularly relevant in patient groups with a high risk of transmission, such as those people who inject drugs (PWID), where the treatment rates have been historically low. This study aimed to quantify how reduced HCV transmission changes the cost-effectiveness of new direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens as a function of treatment uptake rates. METHODS: An established model of HCV disease transmission and progression was used to quantify the impact of treatment uptake (10-100%), within the PWID population, on the cost-effectiveness of a DAA regimen versus pre-DAA standard of care, conducted using daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir in the UK setting as an illustrative example. RESULTS: The consequences of reduced disease transmission due to treatment were associated with additional net monetary benefit of pound24,304- pound90,559 per patient treated at pound20,000/QALY, when 10-100% of eligible patients receive treatment with 100% efficacy. Dependent on patient genotype, the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment using daclatasvir plus sofosbuvir improved by 36-79% versus conventional analysis, at 10-100% treatment uptake in the PWID population. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment was shown to improve as more patients are treated, suggesting that the value of DAA regimens to the NHS could be enhanced by improved treatment uptake rates among PWID. However, the challenge for the future will lie in achieving increased rates of treatment uptake, particularly in the PWID population.",2016-01-21755,27803989,Eur J Health Econ,Hayley Bennett,2016,/,,Yes,27803989,"Hayley Bennett; Jason Gordon; Beverley Jones; Thomas Ward; Samantha Webster; Anupama Kalsekar; Yong Yuan; Michael Brenner; Phil McEwan; Hepatitis C disease transmission and treatment uptake: impact on the cost-effectiveness of new direct-acting antiviral therapies, Eur J Health Econ, 2016 Dec 22; ():1618-7598",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Daclatasvir + Sofosbuvir vs. None,Genotype1,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,3.50,3.50,12068,United Kingdom,2013,20971.32
16043,The cost-effectiveness of bevacizumab for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in Canada,"BACKGROUND: The overall survival (os) analysis of the icon7 trial demonstrated that frontline ovarian cancer patients with a high risk of progression (stage iii suboptimally debulked, and stage iii or iv with unresectable disease) benefited from the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy compared with standard chemotherapy alone. The objective of the present study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness, from a Canadian publicly funded perspective, of adding bevacizumab to frontline treatment of ovarian cancer at high risk of progression. METHODS: An area-under-the-curve, Markov-structured model was used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the treatments. Long-term progression-free survival (pfs) and os were extracted from the icon7 trial (subgroup at high risk of relapse) and extrapolated by parametric time-to-event functions over a time horizon of 10 years. Canadian pfs health state utility values were obtained from the EQ-5D (EuroQoL Group, Rotterdam, Netherlands) questionnaires in the icon7 high-risk patient population. Canadian post-progression utility values were consistent with those for other gynecologic cancers. Cost inputs were informed by public sources. An annual 5% efficacy and cost discount rate was applied. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Ovarian cancer patients at high risk of progression receiving bevacizumab plus standard chemotherapy experienced a mean incremental quality-adjusted life year (qaly) gain of 0.374 years. At an additional cost of $35,901.54, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (icer) for the addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy, relative to standard chemotherapy alone, was $95,942 per qaly. CONCLUSIONS: No formal health technology assessment willingness-to-pay threshold exists in Canada. However, at a threshold of $100,000 per qaly, bevacizumab in addition to chemotherapy is a cost-effective alternative for ovarian cancer patients who are at high risk of progression (stage iii suboptimally debulked, and stage iii or iv with unresectable disease).

16044,The cost-effectiveness of 5-FU-SA in the treatment of actinic keratoses of the face and scalp in the UK secondary care setting,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of Actikerall 1 (5-FU-SA) vs cryotherapy in a secondary care setting in the UK, for lesion-directed treatment in patients with actinic keratoses (AK) of the face and scalp. METHODS: The model was a simple decision tree, with a 6-month time horizon. The perspective was that of the UK National Health Service (NHS). Modeled treatment effects included reported per-patient histological clearance and recurrence rates. Cost inputs comprised professional consultation time and cost of medication. Health-related utility estimation followed previously published methodology. Adverse events were not modeled. The key data and model structural assumptions followed expected UK practice. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess structural and parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: 5-FU-SA was found to be less costly (- pound204) and more effective (+0.001 QALY) in base case and sensitivity analyses. In the probabilistic analysis there was 100% probability of being cost-effective over cryotherapy at pound20,000 willingness to pay. Cost of professional time was a key driver of the model outcome. 5-FU-SA remained dominant across a range of scenario analyses, including exploration of assumptions around setting of care. LIMITATIONS: The time horizon of the analysis was short and data were not extrapolated beyond the duration of the clinical trial; however, this approach is consistent with likely follow-up of an AK patient. The clinical outcomes observed in the trial were based on a large proportion of cryotherapy patients undergoing an additional cycle of treatment; this may not occur or be required in an experienced secondary care setting. CONCLUSION: 5-FU-SA could be considered as a cost-effective choice for treatment of AK lesions of the face and scalp in secondary and mixed care settings in the UK. Use of 5-FU-SA in patients who would otherwise be managed with cryotherapy has the potential to result in cost savings.",2016-01-21767,27715356,J Med Econ,Radek Wojcik,2017,20 / 3,1-7,Yes,27715356,"Radek Wojcik; Julia Lowin; David Vilardell; Silvia Maeso; Leonardo Ruiz; John T Lear; Colin Morton; The cost-effectiveness of 5-FU-SA in the treatment of actinic keratoses of the face and scalp in the UK secondary care setting, J Med Econ, 2017 Mar; 20(3):1369-6998; 1-7",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,5-FU-SA (5-fluorouracil (0.5%) and salicylic acid (10%) vs. Cryotherapy,Face and scalp,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-204660,United Kingdom,2014,-368827.48
16048,Cost-effectiveness analysis of apatinib treatment for chemotherapy-refractory advanced gastric cancer,"BACKGROUND: Apatinib, a third-line or later treatment for advanced gastric cancer (aGC), was shown to improve overall survival and progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo in the phase III trial. Given the modest benefit with high costs, we further evaluated the cost-effectiveness of apatinib for patients with chemotherapy-refractory aGC. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the disease process of aGC (PFS, progressive disease, and death) and estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of apatinib to placebo. The health outcomes and utility scores were derived from the phase III trial and previously published sources, respectively. Total costs were calculated from the perspective of the Chinese health-care payer. Sensitivity analysis was used to explore model uncertainties. RESULTS: Treatment with apatinib was estimated to provide an incremental 0.09 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $8113.86 compared with placebo, which resulted in an ICER of $90,154.00 per QALY.

In Hong Kong, the total number of patient discharges and deaths for ischemic heart diseases in 2009 was 33,363, including 4,360 deaths. There are over 5,000 cases of PCI yearly. This study aimed to compare clinical, economic, and humanistic outcomes among patients receiving drug-eluting stent (DES) or bare metal stent (BMS) in Hong Kong. METHODS: Patients who received stent implantation between September 15, 2009 and October 11, 2010 in Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, were recruited and followed for 18 months. Occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (cardiac death, non-fatal MI, TLR and TVR) was employed as the clinical outcome measurements. Improvement in quality-of-life by stent interventions was measured as quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). EQ-5D questionnaire was adopted to assess the QALY gained. Cost-utility analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis for BMS and DES were employed as the economic outcome measurement. RESULTS: Six hundred and eighty-four patients (DES = 402; BMS = 282) were included. From 0-18 months, TLR rate (2.7% vs 3.5%, p = .549) and TVR rate (3.7% vs 6.4%, p = .111) were lower in the DES group, but without statistical significance.

16053,Cost utility of ERCP-based modalities for the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma in primary sclerosing cholangitis,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Although several ERCP-based diagnostic modalities are available for diagnosing CCA, it is unclear whether one modality is more cost-effective than the others. The primary aim of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of ERCP-based techniques for diagnosing CCA in patients with PSC-induced biliary strictures. METHODS: We performed a cost utility analysis to assess the net monetary benefit for accurately diagnosing CCA using 5 different diagnostic strategies: (1) ERCP with bile duct brushing for cytology, (2) ERCP with brushings for cytology and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-trisomy, (3) ERCP with brushings for cytology and FISH-polysomy, (4) ERCP with intraductal biopsy sampling, and (5) single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC) with targeted biopsy sampling. A Monte Carlo simulation assessed outcomes including quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: SOC with targeted biopsy sampling, as compared with ERCP with brushing for FISH-polysomy, produced an incremental QALY gain of .22 at an additional cost of $8562.44, resulting in a base case ICER of $39,277.25. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated that diagnosis with SOC was cost-effective at conventional willingness-to-pay thresholds of $50,000 and $100,000.

16057,The Cost-Effectiveness of Alogliptin Versus Sulfonylurea as Add-on Therapy to Metformin in Patients with Uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"INTRODUCTION: ENDURE (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, NCT00856284), a multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled study of 2639 patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), found that metformin in combination with alogliptin (12.5 and 25 mg doses), when compared to standard add-on therapy (sulfonylurea, SU), exerted sustained antihyperglycemic effects over 2 years. This economic analysis of ENDURE aimed to quantify the relationship between increased glycemic durability and cost-effectiveness of alogliptin in the UK clinical setting, and communicate its sustained glycemic benefit in economic terms. METHODS: Using baseline characteristics and treatment effects from the ENDURE trial population, between-group cost-effectiveness analyses compared the combined use of metformin and alogliptin (MET + ALO12.5/25) in patients with inadequately controlled T2DM, as an alternative to metformin and SU (MET + SU). In scenario analyses, an intragroup cost-effectiveness analysis compared MET + ALO12.5/25 with MET + SU; a between-group cost-effectiveness analysis also compared MET + ALO12.5/25 versus MET + SU within a subpopulation of patients who achieved HbA1c control (<7.5%) at 2 years on study drug. RESULTS: Compared with baseline profiles of patients, combination therapies with alogliptin or SU were associated with improvements in length and quality of life and were cost-effective at established norms. Despite increased drug acquisition costs, alogliptin at 12.5 mg and 25 mg doses resulted in greater predicted lifetime quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gains with associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of pound10,959/QALY and pound7217/QALY compared to SU, respectively. CONCLUSION: The ENDURE trial and the present cost-effectiveness analysis found that the glycemic durability of alogliptin therapy was associated with improved long-term patient outcomes, QALY gains, and ICERs that were cost-effective when evaluated against standard threshold values. Alogliptin therefore represents a cost-effective treatment alternative to SU as add-on therapy to metformin in patients with poorly managed T2DM.

Transition probabilities among the health states were derived from a trial conducted in Japan and converted to appropriate parameters for our model. The associated cost components, obtained from a receipt-based survey undertaken at the Aichi Medical University Hospital, were those related to inpatient care, outpatient care, and treatment for BTC. Costs for palliative care and treatment of adverse events were obtained from the National Health Insurance price list. We estimated cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) at a time horizon of 36 months. An annual discount of 3 % for both cost and outcome was considered. RESULTS: The base case outcomes indicated that combination therapy was less cost-effective than monotherapy when the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was approximately 14 million yen per QALY gained. The deterministic sensitivity analysis of the ICER revealed that the ICER of the base case was robust. A probabilistic analysis conducted with 10,000-time Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated efficacy at the willingness to pay threshold of 6 million yen per QALY gained for approximately 33 % of the population. CONCLUSION: In Japan, combination therapy is less cost-effective than monotherapy for treating advanced BTC, regardless of the statistical significance of the two therapies. Useful information on the cost-effectiveness of chemotherapy is much needed for the treatment of advanced BTC in Japan.",2016-01-21809,27785685,J Gastrointest Cancer,Ikuto Tsukiyama,2016,/,,No,27785685,"Ikuto Tsukiyama; Masayuki Ejiri; Yoshihiro Yamamoto; Haruhisa Nakao; Masashi Yoneda; Katsuhiko Matsuura; Ichiro Arakawa; Hiroko Saito; Tadao Inoue; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Gemcitabine plus Cisplatin Versus Gemcitabine Alone for Treatment of Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer in Japan, J Gastrointest Cancer, 2016 Dec 27; ():1941-6636",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Gemcitabine plus Cisplatin therapy vs. Gemcitabine monotherapy for the treatment of biliary tract cancer,Advanced Biliary Tract Cancer,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,36 Months,3.00,3.00,13707020,Japan,2012,176396.76
16060,Cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in NYHA class II chronic heart failure patients with reduced LVEF: an analysis for Greece,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness (CE) of treatment with eplerenone versus standard care in adult patients with New York Heart Association class II chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction from the perspective of the Greek national health care payer. METHODS: A discrete-event model simulating the clinical course and respective outcomes of eplerenone as an add-on to standard therapy versus standard therapy alone based on the pivotal Eplerenone in Mild Patients Hospitalization and SurvIval Study in Heart Failure (EMPHASIS-HF) trial was locally adapted for the Greek setting. Data on medications followed the resource use from eplerenone in mild patients hospitalization and survival study in heart failure and were estimated on a lifetime basis (or until discontinuation). Cost calculations were based on year 2014, event costs (cardiovascular hospitalizations, adverse events, and devices) were sourced from published diagnosis-related groups. A 3% discount rate was applied. In order to test the robustness of the model projections, a range of deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were carried out. RESULTS: Over a patient''s lifetime, the addition of eplerenone to standard care compared to standard care alone led to an incremental gain of 1.33 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) (6.53 vs 5.20 QALYs, respectively) as well as an increase in the cost of treatment by euro2,160; these outcomes produced an incremental CE ratio of euro1,624/QALY for the Greek setting. On the basis of probabilistic sensitivity analysis, there was a 100% likelihood of eplerenone being cost-effective versus standard care at a threshold of euro3,500/QALY. CONCLUSION: This analysis indicates that eplerenone may be a cost-effective option versus standard care accompanied by additional clinical benefits and an added incremental cost at an acceptable, if not low, CE ratio. The results are consistent with the previously published studies on the CE of eplerenone as an add-on therapy to standard care, such as those regarding the health care settings of Spain, the UK, and Australia.",2016-01-21811,27785081,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Kostas Athanasakis,2016,8 /,583-590,No,27785081,"Kostas Athanasakis; Aikaterini Bilitou; Dawn Lee; Eleftheria Karampli; Apostolos Karavidas; John Parissis; Georgia Sykara; John Kyriopoulos; Cost-effectiveness of eplerenone in NYHA class II chronic heart failure patients with reduced LVEF: an analysis for Greece, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2016; 8():1178-6981; 583-590",QALY,Greece,Not Stated,Not Stated,Eplerenone vs. Standard/Usual Care,New York Hear Association Class II with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1624,Euro,2014,2360.74

To date, no study has been conducted to examine the cost-effectiveness of this treatment. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of TDF versus four oral nucleos(t)ide analogs [lamivudine (LAM), adefovir (ADV), telbivudine (LdT), and entecavir (ETV)] and from a pharmacoeconomic perspective to assess current drug pricing for TDF. METHODS: Based on Chinese healthcare perspectives, a Markov model was applied to simulate the lifetime (40-year time span) costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for five different monotherapy strategies. Two kinds of rescue combination strategies (base-case: LAM + ADV then ETV + ADV; alternative: directly using ETV + ADV) were separately considered for treatment of patients refractory to monotherapy. Model parameters (including disease transition, cost, and utility) were obtained from previous Chinese population studies. Both branded and generic drugs were separately analyzed. Study model uncertainties were assessed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Two-way sensitivity analysis was used to explore uncertainties between efficacy and price of TDF. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the lowest lifetime cost and the best cost-effectiveness ratio were obtained by ETV, which was considered the reference treatment. LAM, ADV, and LdT treatments had significantly greater costs and lower efficacies. Compared to ETV, TDF was more effective but also more expensive. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of TDF versus ETV were much higher than the willing-to-pay threshold of $20,466 US dollars (USD) per QALY gained (3 x gross domestic product per capita of China, 2014). TDF would be the most cost-effective strategy if the annual cost did not exceed $2260 USD and $1600 USD for branded and generic drugs, respectively.

To date, no study has been conducted to examine the cost-effectiveness of this treatment. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of TDF versus four oral nucleos(t)ide analogs [lamivudine (LAM), adefovir (ADV), telbivudine (LdT), and entecavir (ETV)] and from a pharmacoeconomic perspective to assess current drug pricing for TDF. METHODS: Based on Chinese healthcare perspectives, a Markov model was applied to simulate the lifetime (40-year time span) costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for five different monotherapy strategies. Two kinds of rescue combination strategies (base-case: LAM + ADV then ETV + ADV; alternative: directly using ETV + ADV) were separately considered for treatment of patients refractory to monotherapy. Model parameters (including disease transition, cost, and utility) were obtained from previous Chinese population studies. Both branded and generic drugs were separately analyzed. Study model uncertainties were assessed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Two-way sensitivity analysis was used to explore uncertainties between efficacy and price of TDF. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the lowest lifetime cost and the best cost-effectiveness ratio were obtained by ETV, which was considered the reference treatment.

16077,Cost-effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery in Adolescents With Obesity,"Importance: Severe obesity affects 4% to 6% of US youth and is increasing in prevalence. Bariatric surgery for the treatment of adolescents with severe obesity is becoming more common, but data on cost-effectiveness are limited. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery for adolescents with obesity using recently published results from the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study. Design, Setting, and Patients: A state-transition model was constructed to compare 2 strategies: no surgery and bariatric surgery. In the no surgery strategy, patients remained at their initial body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) over time. In the bariatric surgery strategy, patients were subjected to risks of perioperative mortality and complications as well as initial morbidity but also experienced longer-term quality-of-life improvements associated with weight loss. Cohort demographic information-of the 228 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 17 (1.6) years, the mean (range) body mass index was 53 (34-88), and 171 (75.0%) were female-surgery-related outcomes, and base case time horizon (3 years) were based on data from the Teen-Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery study. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs (in US dollars adjusted to 2015-year values using the Consumer Price Index), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100000 per QALY was used to assess cost-effectiveness. Results: After 3 years, surgery led to a gain of 0.199 QALYs compared with no surgery at an incremental cost of $30747, yielding an unfavorable ICER of $154684 per QALY. When the clinical study results were extrapolated to 4 years, the ICER decreased to $114078 per QALY and became cost-effective by 5 years with an ICER of $91032 per QALY. Outcomes were robust in most 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Conclusions and Relevance: Bariatric surgery incurs substantial initial cost and morbidity. We found that surgery could be a cost-effective treatment for adolescents with severe obesity if assessed over a time horizon of 5 years.

16078,Real-Life Treatment Paradigms Show Adalimumab Is Cost-Effective for the Management of Ulcerative Colitis,"Background. Adalimumab is effective for the maintenance of remission in patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Currently, biologic therapies are used in cases where patients fail conventional medical therapies. If biologic therapies are not available, patients often choose to remain in an unwell state rather than undergo colectomy. Objective. The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab in patients with UC where adalimumab was readily available compared to not available. Methods. A previously validated Markov model was used to simulate disease progression of patients with UC who are corticosteroid-dependent and/or did not respond to thiopurine therapy. Utility scores and transition probabilities between health states were determined by using data from randomized controlled trials and real-life observational studies. Costs were obtained from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative and the Alberta Health Schedule of Medical Benefits. Results. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for readily available adalimumab treatment of UC were $40,000 and $59,000 per quality-adjusted life year, compared with ongoing medical therapy in an unwell state, at 5-year and 10-year treatment time horizons, respectively. Conclusion. Considering real-life patient preferences to avoid colectomy, adalimumab is cost-effective according to a willingness-to-pay threshold of $80,000 for treatment of UC.",2016-01-21819,27781203,Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Candace L Beilman,2016,2016 /,5315798,No,27781203,"Candace L Beilman; Nguyen Xuan Thanh; Victoria Ung; Christopher Ma; Karen Wong; Karen I Kroeker; Thomas Lee; Haili Wang; Arto Ohinmaa; Phil Jacobs; Brendan P Halloran; Richard N Fedorak; Real-Life Treatment Paradigms Show Adalimumab Is Cost-Effective for the Management of Ulcerative Colitis, Can J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2016; 2016():2291-2797; 5315798",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adalimumab vs. None,Patients with moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis who are corticosteroid-dependent and either failed or are intolerant to thiopurine treatment.,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"10 Years, 5, 15 years",5.00,5.00,59000,Canada,2014,58435.58
16079,Cost-effectiveness of seasonal quadrivalent versus trivalent influenza vaccination in the United States: A dynamic transmission modeling approach,"Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3s) protect against 2 A strains and one B lineage; quadrivalent versions (IIV4s) protect against an additional B lineage. The objective was to assess projected health and economic outcomes associated with IIV4 versus IIV3 for preventing seasonal influenza in the US. A cost-effectiveness model was developed to interact with a dynamic transmission model. The transmission model tracked vaccination, influenza cases, infection-spreading interactions, and recovery over 10 y (2012-2022). The cost-effectiveness model estimated influenza-related complications, direct and indirect costs (2013-2014 US$), health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. Inputs were taken from published/public sources or estimated using regression or calibration. Outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Scenario analyses tested the reliability of the results. Seasonal vaccination with IIV4 versus IIV3 is predicted to reduce annual influenza cases by 1,973,849 (discounted; 2,325,644 undiscounted), resulting in 12-13% fewer cases and influenza-related complications and deaths. These reductions are predicted to translate into 18,485 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued annually for IIV4 versus IIV3. Increased vaccine-related costs ($599 million; 5.7%) are predicted to be more than offset by reduced influenza treatment costs ($699 million; 12.2%), resulting in direct medical cost saving annually ($100 million; 0.6%). Including indirect costs, savings with IIV4 are predicted to be $7.1 billion (5.6%). Scenario analyses predict IIV4 to be cost-saving in all scenarios tested apart from low infectivity, where IIV4 is predicted to be cost-effective. In summary, seasonal influenza vaccination in the US with IIV4 versus IIV3 is predicted to improve health outcomes and reduce costs.",2016-01-21821,27780425,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Anita J Brogan,2017,13 / 3,0,No,27780425,"Anita J Brogan; Sandra E Talbird; Ashley E Davis; Edward W Thommes; Genevieve Meier; Cost-effectiveness of seasonal quadrivalent versus trivalent influenza vaccination in the United States: A dynamic transmission modeling approach, Hum Vaccin Immunother , 2017 Mar 04; 13(3):2164-554X; 0",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine vs. Standard/Usual Care- Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-381591.34,United States,2013,-423941.06
16080,Cost-effectiveness of obinutuzumab for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in The Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Obinutuzumab combined with chlorambucil (GClb) has shown to be superior to rituximab combined with chlorambucil (RClb) and chlorambucil (Clb) in newly diagnosed patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness per life-year and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of GClb compared to RClb, Clb, and ofatumumab plus chlorambucil (OClb) in The Netherlands. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of GClb, RClb, Clb and other treatments in the United Kingdom. A country adaptation was made to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these therapies in The Netherlands using Dutch unit costs and Dutch data sources for background mortality and post-progression survival. RESULTS: An incremental gain of 1.06 and 0.64 QALYs was estimated for GClb compared to Clb and RClb respectively, at additional costs of euro23,208 and euro7254 per patient. Corresponding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were euro21,823 and euro11,344 per QALY.

16083,Cost-Effectiveness of Endovascular Stroke Therapy: A Patient Subgroup Analysis From a US Healthcare Perspective,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular therapy in addition to standard care (EVT+SC) has been demonstrated to be more effective than SC in acute ischemic large vessel occlusion stroke. Our aim was to determine the cost-effectiveness of EVT+SC depending on patients'' initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, time from symptom onset, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), and occlusion location. METHODS: A decision model based on Markov simulations estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with both strategies applied in a US setting. Model input parameters were obtained from the literature, including recently pooled outcome data of 5 randomized controlled trials (ESCAPE [Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Proximal Occlusion Ischemic Stroke], EXTEND-IA [Extending the Time for Thrombolysis in Emergency Neurological Deficits-Intra-Arterial], MR CLEAN [Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands], REVASCAT [Randomized Trial of Revascularization With Solitaire FR Device Versus Best Medical Therapy in the Treatment of Acute Stroke Due to Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Presenting Within 8 Hours of Symptom Onset], and SWIFT PRIME [Solitaire With the Intention for Thrombectomy as Primary Endovascular Treatment]). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to estimate uncertainty of the model results. Net monetary benefits, incremental costs, incremental effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were derived from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The willingness-to-pay was set to $50 000/QALY. RESULTS: Overall, EVT+SC was cost-effective compared with SC (incremental cost: $4938, incremental effectiveness: 1.59 QALYs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: $3110/QALY) in 100% of simulations. In all patient subgroups, EVT+SC led to gained QALYs (range: 0.47-2.12), and mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were considered cost-effective. However, subgroups with ASPECTS </=5 or with M2 occlusions showed considerably higher incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ($14 273/QALY and $28 812/QALY, respectively) and only reached suboptimal acceptability in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (75.5% and 59.4%, respectively). All other subgroups had acceptability rates of 90% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: EVT+SC is cost-effective in most subgroups. In patients with ASPECTS </=5 or with M2 occlusions, cost-effectiveness remains uncertain based on current data.",2016-01-21828,27758942,Stroke,Wolfgang G Kunz,2016,47 / 11,2797-2804,No,27758942,"Wolfgang G Kunz; M G Myriam Hunink; Wieland H Sommer; Sebastian E Beyer; Felix G Meinel; Franziska Dorn; Stefan Wirth; Maximilian F Reiser; Birgit Ertl-Wagner; Kolja M Thierfelder; Cost-Effectiveness of Endovascular Stroke Therapy: A Patient Subgroup Analysis From a US Healthcare Perspective, Stroke, 2016 Nov; 47(11):1524-4628; 2797-2804",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular therapy + standard care vs. Standard/Usual Care,Patients with acute ischemic large vessel occlusion stroke,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,3096,United States,2015,3380.68
16084,Dabigatran for the Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Dabigatran was proven to have similar effect on the prevention of recurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and a lower risk of bleeding compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKA). The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness (CE) of dabigatran for the treatment and secondary prevention in patients with VTE compared to VKAs in the Dutch setting. METHODS: Previously published Markov model was modified and updated to assess the CE of dabigatran and VKAs for the treatment and secondary prevention in patients with VTE from a societal perspective in the base-case analysis. The model was populated with efficacy and safety data from major dabigatran trials (i.e. RE-COVER, RECOVER II, RE-MEDY and RE-SONATE), Dutch specific costs, and utilities derived from dabigatran trials or other published literature. Univariate, probabilistic sensitivity and a number of scenario analyses evaluating various decision-analytic settings (e.g. the perspective of analysis, use of anticoagulants only for treatment or only for secondary prevention, or comparison to no treatment) were tested on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, patients on dabigatran gained an additional 0.034 quality adjusted life year (QALY) while saving euro1,598. Results of univariate sensitivity analysis were quite robust. The probability that dabigatran is cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of euro20,000/QALY was 98.1%. From the perspective of healthcare provider, extended anticoagulation with dabigatran compared to VKAs was estimated at euro2,158 per QALY gained. The ICER for anticoagulation versus no treatment in patients with equipoise risk of recurrent VTE was estimated at euro33,379 per QALY gained. Other scenarios showed dabigatran was cost-saving. CONCLUSION: From a societal perspective, dabigatran is likely to be a cost-effective or even cost-saving strategy for treatment and secondary prevention of VTE compared to VKAs in the Netherlands.",2016-01-21833,27776137,PLoS One,J Stevanovic,2016,11 / 10,e0163550,No,27776137,"J Stevanovic; L A de Jong; B S Kappelhoff; E P Dvortsin; M Voorhaar; M J Postma; Dabigatran for the Treatment and Secondary Prevention of Venous Thromboembolism; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis for the Netherlands, PLoS One , 2016; 11(10):1932-6203; e0163550",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dabigatran vs. Vitamin K antagonists,High risk patients of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,-48393.94,Euro,2013,-71407.14
16085,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Treatment Sequence Initiating With Etanercept Compared With Leflunomide in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Impact of Reduced Etanercept Cost With Patent Expiration in South Korea,"PURPOSE: In south Korea, the price of biologics has been decreasing owing to patent expiration and the availability of biosimilars. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a treatment strategy initiated with etanercept (ETN) compared with leflunomide (LFN) after a 30% reduction in the medication cost of ETN in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX-IR). METHODS: A cohort-based Markov model was designed to evaluate the lifetime cost-effectiveness of treatment sequence initiated with ETN (A) compared with 2 sequences initiated with LFN: LFN-ETN sequence (B) and LFN sequence (C). Patients transited through the treatment sequences, which consisted of sequential biologics and palliative therapy, based on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses and the probability of discontinuation. A systematic literature review and a network meta-analysis were conducted to estimate ACR responses to ETN and LFN. Utility was estimated by mapping an equation for converting the Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index score to utility weight. The costs comprised medications, outpatient visits, administration, dispensing, monitoring, palliative therapy, and treatment for adverse events. A subanalysis was conducted to identify the influence of the ETN price reduction compared with the unreduced price, and sensitivity analyses explored the uncertainty of model parameters and assumptions. FINDINGS: The ETN sequence (A) was associated with higher costs and a gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with both sequences initiated with LFN (B, C) throughout the lifetime of patients with RA and MTX-IR. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for strategy A versus B was 13,965,825 (US$1726) per QALY and that for strategy A versus C was 9,587,983 (US$8050) per QALY. The results indicated that strategy A was cost-effective based on the commonly cited ICER threshold of 20,000,000 (US$16,793) per QALY in South Korea. The robustness of the base-case analysis was confirmed using sensitivity analyses. When the unreduced medication cost of ETN was applied in a subanalysis, the ICER for strategy A versus B was 20,909,572 (US$17,556) per QALY and that for strategy A versus C was 22,334,713 (US$18,753) per QALY.

16087,Cost-effectiveness of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of bleeding and normal kidney function,"INTRODUCTION: The comparative cost-effectiveness of all oral anticoagulants approved up to date has not been evaluated from the US perspective. The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban 60mg, apixaban 5mg, dabigatran 150mg, dabigatran 110mg, rivaroxaban 20mg and warfarin in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients at high-risk of bleeding (defined as HAS-BLED score>/=3). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model to evaluate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with each of the six treatments from the perspective of US third-party payers. Probabilities of clinical events were obtained from the RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE AF-TIMI trials; costs were derived from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and other studies. Because edoxaban is only indicated in patients with creatinine clearance </=95ml/min, we re-ran our analyses after excluding edoxaban from the analysis. RESULTS: Treatment with edoxaban 60mg cost $77,565/QALY gained compared to warfarin, and apixaban 5mg cost $108,631/QALY gained compared to edoxaban 60mg.

The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of edoxaban 60mg, apixaban 5mg, dabigatran 150mg, dabigatran 110mg, rivaroxaban 20mg and warfarin in stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients at high-risk of bleeding (defined as HAS-BLED score>/=3). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We constructed a Markov state-transition model to evaluate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with each of the six treatments from the perspective of US third-party payers. Probabilities of clinical events were obtained from the RE-LY, ROCKET-AF, ARISTOTLE and ENGAGE AF-TIMI trials; costs were derived from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and other studies.

16094,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nivolumab versus Docetaxel for Advanced Nonsquamous NSCLC Including PD-L1 Testing,"INTRODUCTION: Nivolumab (NIV) was recently approved in several countries for patients with pretreated advanced NSCLC. NIV is not cost-effective compared with docetaxel (DOC) for the treatment of squamous NSCLC. However, its cost-effectiveness for nonsquamous NSCLC and the consequences of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) testing are unknown. METHODS: This literature-based health economic study used CheckMate-057 trial data to model the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NIV versus DOC in the Swiss health care setting. The effect of PD-L1 positivity for patient selection was assessed. RESULTS: In the base case model, NIV (mean cost CHF66,208; mean effect 0.69 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) compared with DOC (mean cost CHF37,618; mean effect 0.53 QALYs) resulted in an ICER of CHF177,478/QALY gained. Treating only patients with PD-L1-positive tumors (threshold >/=10%) with NIV compared with treating all patients with DOC produced a base case ICER of CHF124,891/QALY gained. Reduced drug price, dose, or treatment duration decreased the ICER partly below a willingness-to-pay threshold of CHF100,000/QALY. Health state utilities strongly influenced cost-effectiveness.

16099,The cost-effectiveness of palivizumab in infants with cystic fibrosis in the Canadian setting: A decision analysis model,"BACKGROUND: Children with cystic fibrosis (CF) are at higher risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, which can lead to a decline in lung function. A monoclonal antibody, palivizumab (PMB), effectively prevents RSV hospitalizations; however, the high cost of PMB, approximately C$10,000 per patient per RSV season, limits its widespread use. We assess the cost-effectiveness of PMB prophylaxis in CF children less than 2 y of age from the Canadian healthcare payer''s perspective. METHODS: In 2014, a Markov cohort model of CF disease and infant RSV infections in the Canadian setting was developed based on literature data. Infants were treated with monthly PMB injections over the 5-month RSV season. Lifetime health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 2013 $CAD costs, discounted at 5%, were estimated. Findings are summarized as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and budget impact. Deterministic sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Implementation of a hypothetical Canadian RSV prophylaxis program resulted in ICERs of C$652,560 (all CF infants) and C$157,332 (high-risk CF infants) per QALY gained and an annual budget impact of C$1,400,000 (all CF infants) and C$285,000 (high-risk CF infants). The analysis was highly sensitive to the probability of severe RSV, the degree of lung deterioration following infection, and the cost of PMB. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest PMB is not cost-effective in Canada by commonly used thresholds.
