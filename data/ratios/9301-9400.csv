9301,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Anal Cancer Screening in HIV-Positive Women,"OBJECTIVE: Anal cancer rates have increased in HIV+ patients. The prevalence of anal intraepithelial neoplasias (AINs) and progression to anal cancer in HIV+ men who have sex with men has been well described, and screening is cost-effective. Our objective was to determine whether anal cancer screening in HIV+ women is cost-effective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model analysis of 100 HIV+ women was constructed. All women had a CD4 count less than 200 and were assumed to be on antiretrovirals. Rates of AIN were based on previous studies. Progression rates were extrapolated from previous data on HIV+ men who have sex with men. The 5-year model included 3 screening approaches: none, annual, and biennial. Anoscopy and biopsy were performed after an abnormal cytologic result. Low-grade AIN was followed with repeat cytology, and high-grade AIN was treated surgically. Anal cancer was treated surgically followed by chemotherapy and radiation. Sensitivity analyses (SAs) were performed to account for variable rates of AIN progression, anal cancer mortality, and anal cancer and HIV quality-adjusted life years. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of biennial anal cancer screening compared to no screening was $34,763. Cost-effectiveness was maintained across all assumptions in SA except for decreased progression rate of high-grade AIN to anal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Biennial anal cancer screening in HIV+ women with CD4 counts less than 200 is cost-effective. Annual screening was not cost-effective, likely because of the slow progression of AIN to anal cancer. Further data on rates of AIN progression in HIV+ women based on CD4 count are needed to determine whether screening is cost-effective in women with higher CD4 counts.",2012-01-08480,22227844,J Low Genit Tract Dis,Gweneth Bratton Lazenby,2012,16 / 3,,No,22227844,"Gweneth Bratton Lazenby; Elizabeth Ramsey Unal; Anne Lintzenich Andrews; Kit Simpson; A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Anal Cancer Screening in HIV-Positive Women, J Low Genit Tract Dis, ; 16(3):1526-0976",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Annual anal cytology vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,112026,United States,2010,132963.83

9303,The Cost-effectiveness of Welcome to Medicare Visual Acuity Screening and a Possible Alternative Welcome to Medicare Eye Evaluation Among Persons Without Diagnosed Diabetes Mellitus,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of visual acuity screening performed in primary care settings and of dilated eye evaluations performed by an eye care professional among new Medicare enrollees with no diagnosed eye disorders. Medicare currently reimburses visual acuity screening for new enrollees during their initial preventive primary care health check, but dilated eye evaluations may be a more cost-effective policy. DESIGN: Monte Carlo cost-effectiveness simulation model with a total of 50?000 simulated patients with demographic characteristics matched to persons 65 years of age in the US population. RESULTS: Compared with no screening policy, dilated eye evaluations increased quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.008 (95% credible interval [CrI], 0.005-0.011) and increased costs by $94 (95% CrI, -$35 to $222). A visual acuity screening increased QALYs in less than 95% of the simulations (0.001 [95% CrI, -0.002 to 0.004) and increased total costs by $32 (95% CrI, -$97 to $159) per person. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a visual acuity screening and an eye examination compared with no screening were $29?000 and $12?000 per QALY gained, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay value of $15?000 or more per QALY gained, a dilated eye evaluation was the policy option most likely to be cost-effective.

9306,Economic assessment of screening for pre-eclampsia,"BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is a major contributor to maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Our objectives in this study are to economically assess, from the payer perspective, routine screening for pre-eclampsia using placental markers - placental protein 13 and placental growth factor - and uterine artery Doppler compared with standard care. METHODS: A decision model was developed, which progresses through three sequential endpoints, and compares screening with no screening: (1) Pre-eclampsia yes/no: calculation of the incremental cost of pre-eclampsia-case averted; (2) Hospital discharge: calculation of the mean accumulated costs until discharge after delivery; and (3) Offspring death: calculation of the incremental cost per quality of life-adjusted life-year gained by screening. Data used includes: (1) Obstetrical data of 14 500 births; (2) cost data from the Israeli Ministry of Health and the literature; and (3) screening performance and outcome from the literature. RESULTS: (1) The incremental cost of pre-eclampsia-case averted is $66?949 and $24?723 when the prevalence is 1.7 and 5% respectively. (2) With test cost of $112, the total cost until discharge with/without screening is equal. With pre-eclampsia prevalence of 3%, screening is cheaper. (3) The cost per quality of life-adjusted life-year with screening is $18?919 and?<?$10?000 with pre-eclampsia prevalence of 1.7 and 3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for pre-eclampsia is cost-effective under various scenarios.

9307,Impact of Comorbidity on Colorectal Cancer Screening Cost-Effectiveness Study in Diabetic Populations,"BACKGROUND: Although comorbidity has been shown to affect the benefits and risks of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, it has not been accounted for in prior cost-effectiveness analyses of CRC screening. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, a highly prevalent comorbidity in U.S. adults aged 50 and older, on health and economic outcomes of CRC screening. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using an integrated modeling framework. DATA SOURCES: Derived from basic and epidemiologic studies, clinical trials, cancer registries, and a colonoscopy database. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. 50-year-old population. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Costs are based on Medicare reimbursement rates. INTERVENTIONS: Colonoscopy screening at ten-year intervals, beginning at age 50, and discontinued after age 50, 60, 70, 80 or death. OUTCOME MEASURES: Health outcomes and cost effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Diabetes diagnosis significantly affects cost-effectiveness of CRC screening. For the same CRC screening strategy, a person without diabetes at age 50 gained on average 0.07-0.13 life years more than a person diagnosed with diabetes at age 50 or younger. For a population of 1,000 patients diagnosed with diabetes at baseline, increasing stop age from 70?years to 80?years increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by 0.3, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $206,671/QALY. The corresponding figures for 1,000 patients without diabetes are 2.3 QALYs and $46,957/QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness results are sensitive to cost of colonoscopy and adherence to colonoscopy screening. LIMITATIONS: Results depend on accuracy of model assumptions. CONCLUSION: Benefits of CRC screening differ substantially for patients with and without diabetes.

9313,Impact of Comorbidity on Colorectal Cancer Screening Cost-Effectiveness Study in Diabetic Populations,"BACKGROUND: Although comorbidity has been shown to affect the benefits and risks of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, it has not been accounted for in prior cost-effectiveness analyses of CRC screening. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, a highly prevalent comorbidity in U.S. adults aged 50 and older, on health and economic outcomes of CRC screening. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using an integrated modeling framework. DATA SOURCES: Derived from basic and epidemiologic studies, clinical trials, cancer registries, and a colonoscopy database. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. 50-year-old population. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Costs are based on Medicare reimbursement rates. INTERVENTIONS: Colonoscopy screening at ten-year intervals, beginning at age 50, and discontinued after age 50, 60, 70, 80 or death. OUTCOME MEASURES: Health outcomes and cost effectiveness. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Diabetes diagnosis significantly affects cost-effectiveness of CRC screening. For the same CRC screening strategy, a person without diabetes at age 50 gained on average 0.07-0.13 life years more than a person diagnosed with diabetes at age 50 or younger. For a population of 1,000 patients diagnosed with diabetes at baseline, increasing stop age from 70?years to 80?years increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained by 0.3, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $206,671/QALY. The corresponding figures for 1,000 patients without diabetes are 2.3 QALYs and $46,957/QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Cost-effectiveness results are sensitive to cost of colonoscopy and adherence to colonoscopy screening. LIMITATIONS: Results depend on accuracy of model assumptions.

To assess this influence we used an individual-based simulation model describing the relation between 14 HPV types and cervical disease, allowing the occurrence of multiple type infections. Screening scenarios for vaccinated women were evaluated, firstly for HPV16/18 vaccination with partial cross-protection against HPV 31, 33, 45 and 58 and secondly, for broad spectrum vaccination against 5-13 HPV types. The vaccine-induced incidence reduction of type-specific infection was varied from 0 to 95% in the cross-protection setting and set at 100% in the setting of broad spectrum vaccines. Scenarios of either cytology or HPV DNA screening were considered under varying lifetime number of screening rounds. At a cost-effectiveness threshold of ?20,000/QALY, four times HPV DNA screening between 30 and 60 years was the selected scenario in addition to HPV16/18 vaccination, whether or not cross-protection was conferred (?6707 and ?9994/QALY, respectively). In the absence of cross-protection, a fifth screening round might be considered (ICER ?22,967/QALY). In addition to broad spectrum vaccination, one screen during lifetime was cost-effective up to an 11-valent vaccine.

9327,How Much Should We Pay for a New HIV Diagnosis? A Mathematical Model of HIV Screening in US Clinical Settings,"OBJECTIVE: To develop a model to assist clinical setting decision makers in determining how much they can spend on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening and still be cost-effective. DESIGN: . The authors developed a simple mathematical model relating the program cost per new HIV diagnosis to the cost per HIV infection averted and the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved by screening. They estimated outcomes based on behavioral changes associated with awareness of HIV infection and applied the model to US sexually transmitted disease clinics. METHODS: The authors based the cost per new HIV diagnosis (2009 US dollars) on the costs of testing and the proportion of persons who tested positive. Infections averted were calculated from the reduction in annual transmission rates between persons aware and unaware of their infections. The authors defined program costs from the sexually transmitted disease clinic perspective and treatment costs and QALYs saved from the societal perspective. They undertook numerous sensitivity analyses to determine the robustness of the base case results. RESULTS: In the base case, the cost per new HIV diagnosis was $2528, the cost per infection averted was $40,516, and the cost per QALY saved was less than zero, or cost-saving. Given the model inputs, the cost per new diagnosis could increase to $22,909 to reach the cost-saving threshold and to $63,053 for the cost-effectiveness threshold. All sensitivity analyses showed that the cost-effectiveness results were consistent for extensive variation in the values of model inputs. CONCLUSIONS: HIV screening in a clinical setting is cost-effective for a wide range of testing costs, variations in positivity rates, reductions in HIV transmissions, and variation in the receipt of test results.",2012-01-08511,22247422,Med Decis Making,Paul G Farnham,2012,32 / 3,,No,22247422,"Paul G Farnham; Stephanie L Sansom; Angela B Hutchinson; How Much Should We Pay for a New HIV Diagnosis?

Early hospital discharge of infants born to group B streptococci-positive mothers: a decision analysis. BJOG 2012;119:439-448. Objective To compare the cost-effectiveness of an additional 24-hour inpatient observation for asymptomatic term neonates born to group B streptococcus (GBS) -colonised mothers with adequate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) after an initial 24-hour in-hospital observation. Design Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective. Setting United States. Population Asymptomatic term neonates born to GBS-colonised mothers with IAP after an initial 24-hour in-hospital observation. Methods Monte Carlo simulation for a decision tree model incorporating the following chance events: development of GBS sepsis during the second 24 hours of life, development of GBS sepsis between 48 hours and 7 days of life, prompt versus delayed treatment for sepsis, neonatal mortality and long-term health sequelae. Main outcome measures Expected cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Results Delayed, versus early, hospital discharge results in similar mean expected QALYs, but substantially higher expected cost. The mean difference in QALY is 0.00016 (95% CI 0.00005-0.00040), whereas the mean difference in cost is $1170.96 (95% CI $750.13-1584.32). The ICER is estimated to be $9,771,520.87 per QALY (95% CI $2,573,139.89-24,407,017.82). The proportion of early-onset GBS that develops during the second 24 hours of life, the cost of 24 hours of inpatient observation, and the probability of long-term sequelae following prompt versus delayed treatment play important roles in determining the cost-effectiveness of delayed hospital discharge.

9341,Cost-effectiveness of a classification-based system for sub-acute and chronic low back pain,"PURPOSE: Identifying relevant subgroups in patients with low back pain (LBP) is considered important to guide physical therapy practice and to improve outcomes. The aim of the present study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a modified version of Delitto's classification-based treatment approach compared with usual physical therapy care in patients with sub-acute and chronic LBP with 1?year follow-up. METHODS: All patients were classified using the modified version of Delitto's classification-based system and then randomly assigned to receive either classification-based treatment or usual physical therapy care. The main clinical outcomes measured were; global perceived effect, intensity of pain, functional disability and quality of life. Costs were measured from a societal perspective. Multiple imputations were used for missing data. Uncertainty surrounding cost differences and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios was estimated using bootstrapping. Cost-effectiveness planes and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were estimated. RESULTS: In total, 156 patients were included. The outcome analyses showed a significantly better outcome on global perceived effect favoring the classification-based approach, and no differences between the groups on pain, disability and quality-adjusted life-years. Mean total societal costs for the classification-based group were <euro>2,287, and for the usual physical therapy care group <euro>2,020. The difference was <euro>266 (95% CI <euro>-720 to <euro>1,612) and not statistically significant. Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that the classification-based approach was not cost-effective in comparison with usual physical therapy care for any clinical outcome measure.

9347,Cost-utility analysis of adjuvant goserelin (Zoladex) and adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal women with breast cancer,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Increased health care costs have made it incumbent on health-care facilities and physicians to demonstrate both clinical and cost efficacy when recommending treatments. Though studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant goserelin with radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer, few have compared the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant goserelin to adjuvant chemotherapy alone in premenopausal breast cancer. METHODS: In this retrospective study at one hospital, the records of 152 patients with stage Ia to IIIa ER + breast cancer who received goserelin or chemotherapy were reviewed. Survival analysis was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients were interviewed to evaluate their quality of life using the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30, version 4.0), and to obtain the utility value by the standard gamble (SG) and visual scale (VS) methods. Total medical cost was assessed from the (National Health Insurance) NHI payer's perspective. RESULTS: Survival at 11 years was significantly better in the groserelin group (P < 0.0012). The lifetime lost was lower in the goserelin group (42 months vs. 66 months). The quality adjusted survival (QAS) of patients who received goserelin was longer (122.5 +/- 6.3 vs. 112.2 +/- 6.7 months).

Though studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant goserelin with radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate cancer, few have compared the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant goserelin to adjuvant chemotherapy alone in premenopausal breast cancer. METHODS: In this retrospective study at one hospital, the records of 152 patients with stage Ia to IIIa ER + breast cancer who received goserelin or chemotherapy were reviewed. Survival analysis was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. Patients were interviewed to evaluate their quality of life using the European Organization for Research and Treatment Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30, version 4.0), and to obtain the utility value by the standard gamble (SG) and visual scale (VS) methods. Total medical cost was assessed from the (National Health Insurance) NHI payer's perspective. RESULTS: Survival at 11 years was significantly better in the groserelin group (P < 0.0012). The lifetime lost was lower in the goserelin group (42 months vs. 66 months).

The cost-effectiveness of the current screening program (a screening test that combines cytology and colposcopy in gynecological outpatient services) and of a planned new screening program (only cytology, and Pap smear is taken locally by public health nurses), both supported with a more active communication campaign, were compared with no screening.The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the intensified current screening practice was $33,100 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with no screening, whereas the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the renewed program was $18,990 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with no screening. The most influential parameters in the deterministic analysis were the quality-of-life weights of undetected stage I or IIA cancer. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99.9% of the simulations were below the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $30,000 per quality-adjusted life-year in the case of the renewed strategy.Providing services closer to the population is a rational economic option for the reform of the Hungarian cervical cancer screening program.

9361,Updating and confirming an industry-sponsored pharmacoeconomic model: comparing two antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia,"This study updated a 2001 decision economic model that used indirect data and confirmed its findings by developing a new cost-effectiveness model by using now available head-to-head data. The models compared olanzapine with ziprasidone in the treatment of schizophrenia in the United States.A decision analytic modeling approach was used to estimate annual health-care costs and health outcomes, incorporating events such as response, relapse, and suicide. Patients without response to first-line treatment switched to the other comparator. Decision tree probabilities were extracted from head-to-head studies and other published clinical literature. Direct health-care costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated on the basis of resource use and utility weights for initial and relapse episodes, maintenance therapy, and extended episodes of illness. Disutilities associated with treatment-emergent adverse events were included.Consistent with the 2001 model, this model found that first-line treatment with olanzapine is associated with fewer hospital days, fewer days with extrapyramidal symptoms, and higher QALYs than is first-line treatment with ziprasidone. Total costs were lower for the olanzapine pathway ($70,232-$72,776 vs. $73,086-$73,310 in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale analysis) due to the cost savings associated with reduced health-care resource use. The incremental cost per QALY gained indicated that the olanzapine pathway dominated the ziprasidone pathway.Decision analytic models should be continuously assessed against new data. This case study shows that incorporating new data confirmed results of a previously published model in which olanzapine was associated with better expected health outcomes and lower total health-care costs than was ziprasidone.",2012-01-08533,22264972,Value Health,Christopher N Graham,2012,15 /,55-64,Yes,22264972,"Christopher N Graham; Josephine A Mauskopf; Anthony H Lawson; Haya Ascher-Svanum; David Bruhn; Updating and confirming an industry-sponsored pharmacoeconomic model: comparing two antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia, Value Health, ; 15 ():1098-3015; 55-64",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Olanzapine as first-line treatment vs. Ziprasidone as the first-line treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2009,Not Stated
9362,Cost-effectiveness of maintenance pemetrexed in patients with advanced nonsquamous-cell lung cancer from the perspective of the swiss health care system,"A recent randomized study showed switch maintenance with pemetrexed after nonpemetrexed-containing first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer to prolong overall survival by 2.8 months. We examined the cost-effectiveness of pemetrexed in this indication, from the perspective of the Swiss health care system, and assessed the influence of the costs of best supportive care (BSC) on overall cost-effectiveness.A Markov model was constructed based on the pemetrexed maintenance study, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of adding pemetrexed until disease progression was calculated as cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Uncertainties concerning the costs of BSC on the ICER were addressed.The base case ICER for maintenance therapy with pemetrexed plus BSC compared to BSC alone was ?106,202 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Varying the costs for BSC had a marked effect. Assuming a reduction of the costs for BSC by 25% in the pemetrexed arm resulted in an ICER of ?47,531 per quality-adjusted life-year, which is below predefined criteria for cost effectiveness in Switzerland.Switch maintenance with pemetrexed in patients with advanced nonsquamous-cell lung cancer after standard first-line chemotherapy is not cost-effective.

9371,Cost and Effectiveness Evaluation of Prophylactic HPV Vaccine in Developing Countries,"Approximately 80% of cervical cancer cases occur in developing countries. In Thailand, cervical cancer has been the leading cancer in females, with an incidence of 24.7 cases per 100,000 individuals per year.We constructed a decision model to simulate the lifetime economic impact for women in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection prevention. HPV-related diseases were of interest: cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and genital warts. The two strategies used were 1) current practice and 2) prophylactic quadrivalent vaccine against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18.We developed a Markov simulation model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of prophylactic HPV vaccine. Women transition through a model either healthy or developing HPV or its related diseases, or die from cervical cancer or from other causes according to transitional probabilities under the Thai health-care context. Costs from a provider perspective were obtained from King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually.Compared with no prophylactic HPV vaccine, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 160,649.50 baht per quality-adjusted life-year. The mortality rate was reduced by 54.8%. The incidence of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2/3, and genital warts was reduced by up to 55.1%.Compared with commonly accepted standard thresholds recommended by the World Health Organization Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, the nationwide coverage of HPV vaccination in girls is likely to be cost-effective in Thailand.",2012-01-08538,22265063,Value Health,Wichai Termrungruanglert,2012,15 /,S29-34,Yes,22265063,"Wichai Termrungruanglert; Piyalamporn Havanond; Nipon Khemapech; Somrat Lertmaharit; Sathirakorn Pongpanich; Chonlakiet Khorprasert; Surasak Taneepanichskul; Cost and Effectiveness Evaluation of Prophylactic HPV Vaccine in Developing Countries, Value Health, ; 15 ():1098-3015; S29-34",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination vs. Standard of care,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,160649.5,Thailand,2010,6023.14

The diabetes management and complications costs were obtained from Chinese published data and adjusted to 2010 values by using the Chinese consumer price index. An annual discounting rate of 3% was used for both health and cost outcomes, and one-way sensitivities analysis was performed, which illustrated that the results were robust.Conversion to IDet from IGla was projected to improve patient life expectancy by 0.06 year and 0.48 quality-adjusted life-years. Drug costs and management costs of diabetes mellitus were increased by US$368 (US$17,466 vs. US$17,097) and US$31 (US$5464 vs. US$5433), respectively. However, the costs of complications, including cerebrovascular disease, renal complications, ulcer/amputation/neuropathy, eye complications, and hypoglycemia events, were reduced by US$819 (US$21,294 vs. US$22,114), resulting in a total direct medical cost saving of US$420 when converting to IDet.Conversion to IDet from an IGla regimen improved life expectancy and was a cost-saving treatment approach in a Chinese setting.",2012-01-08541,22265068,Value Health,Li Yang,2012,15 /,S56-9,Yes,22265068,"Li Yang; Torsten Christensen; Fengyu Sun; Jinghua Chang; Cost-Effectiveness of Switching Patients with Type 2 Diabetes from Insulin Glargine to Insulin Detemir in Chinese Setting: A Health Economic Model Based on the PREDICTIVE Study, Value Health, ; 15 ():1098-3015; S56-9",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insulin detemir (Idet) plus oral antidiabetic agent (OAD) vs. Insulin galargine (IG1A) plus oral antidiabetic agent (OAD),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,3.00,3.00,-869.57,United States,2010,-1032.09
9373,The cost-effectiveness of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty compared with hemiarthroplasty for rotator cuff tear arthropathy,"BACKGROUND: Hemiarthroplasty (humeral head replacement [HHR]) and reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) are surgical options for cuff tear arthropathy (CTA). RSA may provide better pain relief and functional outcomes, but it costs more and may have a higher complication rate. The goal of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of these two treatments and to use sensitivity analysis to determine the drivers of the model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov decision model was used. Outcome and complication probabilities were obtained from existing literature. Costs were based on average Medicare reimbursement and implant prices. Utilities were derived from responses to health state surveys (Short Form 6D) from 31 patients at one institution who underwent RSA or HHR for CTA. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were used to compare treatments. RESULTS: Our model showed RSA could be a cost-effective strategy for treatment of CTA, using $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained as a cutoff and the Short Form 6D for utilities. The model was extremely sensitive to the complication rate and the utility of each procedure and was also sensitive to implant price, with an implant price <$13,000 making RSA cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available cost and outcome data show that RSA could be a cost-effective alternative to HHR for CTA. The cost-effectiveness of RSA depends most on the health utility gained from the operation, the utility lost due to complications from the operation, and the cost of the implant. Dropping the implant price to <$7,000 increases cost-effectiveness to <$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Further head-to-head studies evaluating the clinical and quality of life outcomes of these two treatments are warranted.",2012-01-08544,22265767,J Shoulder Elbow Surg,Marcus P Coe,2012,21 / 10,,No,22265767,"Marcus P Coe; R Michael Greiwe; Rohan Joshi; Benjamin M Snyder; Lauren Simpson; Anna N A Tosteson; Christopher S Ahmad; William N Levine; John-Erik Bell; The cost-effectiveness of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty compared with hemiarthroplasty for rotator cuff tear arthropathy, J Shoulder Elbow Surg, ; 21(10):1532-6500",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) vs. Hemiarthroplasty humeral head replacement (HHR),Not Stated,70 Years,70 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,94118,United States,2008,113137.18
9374,A Cost-Utility Analysis of Cinacalcet in Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Five European Countries,"Background and Objective: A probabilistic patient-level Markov model was previously developed to simulate lifetime clinical and economic outcomes of cinacalcet treatment in secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) patients using local data from Italy. The present study extends the application of the model to four other European countries - Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and the Czech Republic - in order to assess the consistency of results. Methods: Cinacalcet influences the levels of parathyroid hormone, serum calcium and phosphorous. Our simulation was based on data from the OPTIMA (Open-Label, Randomized Study Using Cinacalcet to Improve Achievement of KDOQI Targets in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease) randomized controlled trial and from published correlations between bone-metabolism parameters, mortality and morbidity (cardiovascular [CV] events, fractures and parathyroidectomy). Local epidemiological and cost data for dialysis, drugs and event management were incorporated into the model. The simulation horizon was patient lifetime; standard treatment for SHPT (vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders) and cinacalcet plus standard treatment were compared. Effectiveness was measured in terms of life expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). Health utility indexes derived from published literature took into account dialysis, CV events and fractures. Results: The simulated mean LE extension in patients receiving cinacalcet was 1.20 life-years (LY) in Italy, 1.10 LY in Spain, 1.18 LY in Portugal, 1.10 LY in the Czech Republic and 1.40 LY in Switzerland.

9379,Cost-Effectiveness of Early Colectomy With Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastamosis Versus Standard Medical Therapy in Severe Ulcerative Colitis,"BACKGROUND:: Inflammatory bowel diseases are costly chronic gastrointestinal diseases. We aimed to determine whether immediate colectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastamosis (IPAA) after diagnosis of severe ulcerative colitis (UC) was cost-effective compared to the standard medical therapy. METHODS:: We created a Markov model simulating 2 cohorts of 21-year-old patients with severe UC, following them until 100 years of age or death, comparing early colectomy with IPAA strategy to the standard medical therapy strategy. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were performed. RESULTS:: Standard medical care accrued a discounted lifetime cost of $236,370 per patient. In contrast, early colectomy with IPAA accrued a discounted lifetime cost of $147,763 per patient. Lifetime quality-adjusted life-years gained (QALY-gained) for standard medical therapy was 20.78, while QALY-gained for early colectomy with IPAA was 20.72. The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (?costs/?QALY) was approximately $1.5 million per QALY-gained. Results were robust to one-way sensitivity analyses for all variables in the model. Quality-of-life after colectomy with IPAA was the most sensitive variable impacting cost-effectiveness. A low utility value of less than 0.7 after colectomy with IPAA was necessary for the colectomy with IPAA strategy to be cost-ineffective. CONCLUSIONS:: Under the appropriate clinical settings, early colectomy with IPAA after diagnosis of severe UC reduces health care expenditures and provides comparable quality of life compared to exhaustive standard medical therapy.",2012-01-08550,22270693,Ann Surg,K T Park,2012,256 / 1,,No,22270693,"K T Park; Raymond Tsai; Felipe Perez; Lauren E Cipriano; Dorsey Bass; Alan M Garber; Cost-Effectiveness of Early Colectomy With Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastamosis Versus Standard Medical Therapy in Severe Ulcerative Colitis, Ann Surg, ; 256(1):0003-4932",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Standard medical therapy vs. Immediate colectomy with ilial pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA),Not Stated,21 Years,21 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1476783,United States,2009,1781546.7
9380,The cost-effectiveness of a school-based smoking prevention program in India,"Intervention programs aimed at preventing tobacco use among youth have been shown to be effective in curbing tobacco use onset and progression. However, the effects of even very successful tobacco prevention programs may not always impress policy-makers and lay audiences. Economic analysis potentially strengthens the case. In this paper, we evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a youth tobacco use prevention program which has been translated and implemented in India, a developing country. Although programs like these are inexpensive to implement in the USA, they are even less expensive in India due to low labor costs. Our results show that the costs per quality-adjusted life-year added, due to averted smoking, was $2057, even without including averted medical costs. If we ignore student time, cost-effectiveness improves by roughly 10%. To put the cost-effectiveness of this smoking prevention program into context, it is over 24 times more cost-effective than dialysis in the USA, which costs $50,000 for a life-year.",2012-01-08551,22271928,Health Promot Int,H Shelton 3rd Brown,2013,28 / 2,,No,22271928,"H Shelton 3rd Brown; Melissa Stigler; Cheryl Perry; Poonam Dhavan; Monika Arora; K Srinath Reddy; The cost-effectiveness of a school-based smoking prevention program in India, Health Promot Int, 2013 Jun; 28(2):0957-4824",QALY,India,Not Stated,Not Stated,School based smoking cessation progam vs. None,Not Stated,16 Years,10 Years,"Female, Male",Full,26 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,3230.33,United States,2006,4147.05

METHODS: From 2005 until 2008 an economic evaluation was performed alongside a pragmatic multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing UI patients receiving care by nurse specialists with patients receiving care-as-usual by GPs in the Netherlands. One hundred eighty-six adult patients with stress, urgency, or mixed UI were randomly allocated to the intervention and 198 to care-as-usual; they were followed for 1 year. Main outcome measures were Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY(societal) ) based on societal preferences for health outcomes (EuroQol-5D), QALY(patient) based on patient preferences for health outcomes (EuroQol VAS), and Incontinence Severity weighted Life Year (ISLY) based on patient-reported severity and impact of UI (ICIQ-UI SF). Health care resource use, patient and family costs, and productivity costs were assessed. Data were collected by three monthly questionnaires. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Uncertainty was assessed using bootstrap simulation, and the expected value of perfect information was calculated (EVPI). RESULTS: Compared to care-as-usual, nurse specialist involvement costs ? 16,742/QALY(societal) gained. Both QALY(patient) and ISLY yield slightly more favorable cost-effectiveness results. At a threshold of ? 40,000/QALY(societal,) the probability that the intervention is cost-effective is 58%. The EVPI amounts to ? 78 million.

9388,Cost-effectiveness of multi-component interventions to prevent delirium in older people admitted to medical wards,"Introduction: there is evidence to suggest that delirium incidence can be reduced in older people admitted to medical services using multi-component interventions that target delirium risk factors. The cost-effectiveness of this approach is uncertain. We therefore developed a novel cost-effectiveness model for delirium prevention.Method: we compared multi-component delirium prevention intervention with usual care using a model based on a decision tree analysis. The model was used to estimate the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB). The robustness of the cost-effectiveness result was explored using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Result: the multi-component prevention intervention was cost-effective when compared with usual care. It was associated with an INMB of ?2,200 using a cost-effectiveness threshold of ?20,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). It remained cost-effective in the majority of the deterministic sensitivity analyses and was cost-effective in 96.8% of the simulations carried out in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis.Discussion: our analysis has shown convincingly that multi-component prevention interventions for delirium should be considered as a cost-effective health-care strategy for medically ill people admitted to hospital. It is an attractive intervention for health-care planners as they strive to reconfigure their services to better meet the needs of an ageing population.",2012-01-08565,22282171,Age Ageing,Anayo Akunne,2012,41 / 3,,No,22282171,"Anayo Akunne; Lakshmi Murthy; John Young; Cost-effectiveness of multi-component interventions to prevent delirium in older people admitted to medical wards, Age Ageing, ; 41(3):0002-0729",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Multi-component delirium prevention intervention vs. Standard of care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.50,3.50,-6375,United Kingdom,2010,-11681.05
9389,Golimumab for the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis: A NICE Single Technology Appraisal,"The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) invited the manufacturer of golimumab (Schering-Plough/Centocor) to submit evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of this drug for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in patients who have responded inadequately to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) to critically appraise the evidence presented by the manufacturer. This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The main clinical effectiveness data were derived from a single phase III randomized controlled trial (GO-REVEAL) that compared golimumab with placebo for the treatment of active and progressive patients who were symptomatic despite the use of previous DMARDs or NSAIDs. The 14-week data showed that, compared with placebo, golimumab 50?mg significantly improved joint disease response as measured by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 (relative risk [RR] 5.73, 95% CI 3.24, 10.56) and Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) [RR 3.45, 95% CI 2.49, 4.87], and significantly improved skin disease response as measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (RR 15.95, 95% CI 4.62, 59.11). The 24-week absolute data showed that these treatment benefits were maintained. There was a significant improvement in patients' functional status as measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire change from baseline at 24 weeks (-0.33; p?<?0.001). The open-label extension data showed that these beneficial effects were also maintained at 52 and 104 weeks. The ERG identified several issues relating to the clinical effectiveness results. Analyses of the 24-week data were less robust, failing to adjust for treatment contamination due to patient crossover at week 16. It was also unclear if these results were generalizable to clinical practice. No randomized controlled trial compared the effectiveness of different biologic therapies head-to-head. To compare the effectiveness of the biologics etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab, the manufacturer conducted a network meta-analysis, including the comparator palliative care (usual care including use of NSAIDs or DMARDs). The ERG considered the assumption of exchangeability between the trials for the purpose of the network meta-analysis to be acceptable and the statistical approach to be reliable. The results indicated somewhat lower efficacy with golimumab than with comparator biologics. The ERG identified a number of issues relating to the cost-effectiveness results. The manufacturer calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) incorrectly by comparing golimumab with palliative care instead of the most cost-effective alternative (etanercept). Despite the manufacturer's claim that golimumab was a cost-effective treatment option, the manufacturer's own model showed that golimumab was unlikely to be cost effective, relative to currently accepted thresholds, when the ICERs were correctly calculated using an incremental analysis (i.e. comparing each treatment to the next best alternative). None of the sensitivity analyses carried out by the manufacturer or the ERG regarding uncertainty in the estimates of clinical effectiveness, the acquisition and administration cost of drugs, the cost of treating psoriasis and the utility functions estimated to generate health outcomes changed this conclusion. However, a key area in determining the cost effectiveness of biologics was whether they should be treated as a class. The ERG concluded that if all biologics were considered equally effective, then etanercept, adalimumab and golimumab had almost equal costs and equal QALYs, and all had an ICER of about ?15?000 per QALY versus palliative care, whilst infliximab, with a higher acquisition cost, was dominated by the other biologics. The Appraisal Committee altered its position between the Appraisal Consultation Document and the Final Appraisal Determination. It ultimately recommended that golimumab be provided as an option for the treatment of active and progressive PsA in adults only if (i) it is used as described for other tumour necrosis factor inhibitor treatments in 'Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis' (NICE clinical guideline 199); and (ii) the manufacturer provides the 100?mg dose of golimumab at the same cost as the 50?mg dose.",2012-01-08568,22283690,Pharmacoeconomics,Huiqin Yang,2011,/,,Yes,22283690,"Huiqin Yang; Dawn Craig; David Epstein; Laura Bojke; Kate Light; Ian N Bruce; Mark Sculpher; Nerys Woolacott; Golimumab for the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis: A NICE Single Technology Appraisal, Pharmacoeconomics, ; ():1179-2027",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adalimumab vs. Palliative care (usual care including NSAIDs or DMARDs),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,18824,United Kingdom,2010,34491.62

The 14-week data showed that, compared with placebo, golimumab 50?mg significantly improved joint disease response as measured by American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 (relative risk [RR] 5.73, 95% CI 3.24, 10.56) and Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) [RR 3.45, 95% CI 2.49, 4.87], and significantly improved skin disease response as measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 75 (RR 15.95, 95% CI 4.62, 59.11). The 24-week absolute data showed that these treatment benefits were maintained. There was a significant improvement in patients' functional status as measured by Health Assessment Questionnaire change from baseline at 24 weeks (-0.33; p?<?0.001). The open-label extension data showed that these beneficial effects were also maintained at 52 and 104 weeks. The ERG identified several issues relating to the clinical effectiveness results. Analyses of the 24-week data were less robust, failing to adjust for treatment contamination due to patient crossover at week 16. It was also unclear if these results were generalizable to clinical practice. No randomized controlled trial compared the effectiveness of different biologic therapies head-to-head. To compare the effectiveness of the biologics etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab, the manufacturer conducted a network meta-analysis, including the comparator palliative care (usual care including use of NSAIDs or DMARDs). The ERG considered the assumption of exchangeability between the trials for the purpose of the network meta-analysis to be acceptable and the statistical approach to be reliable. The results indicated somewhat lower efficacy with golimumab than with comparator biologics. The ERG identified a number of issues relating to the cost-effectiveness results. The manufacturer calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) incorrectly by comparing golimumab with palliative care instead of the most cost-effective alternative (etanercept). Despite the manufacturer's claim that golimumab was a cost-effective treatment option, the manufacturer's own model showed that golimumab was unlikely to be cost effective, relative to currently accepted thresholds, when the ICERs were correctly calculated using an incremental analysis (i.e. comparing each treatment to the next best alternative). None of the sensitivity analyses carried out by the manufacturer or the ERG regarding uncertainty in the estimates of clinical effectiveness, the acquisition and administration cost of drugs, the cost of treating psoriasis and the utility functions estimated to generate health outcomes changed this conclusion. However, a key area in determining the cost effectiveness of biologics was whether they should be treated as a class. The ERG concluded that if all biologics were considered equally effective, then etanercept, adalimumab and golimumab had almost equal costs and equal QALYs, and all had an ICER of about ?15?000 per QALY versus palliative care, whilst infliximab, with a higher acquisition cost, was dominated by the other biologics. The Appraisal Committee altered its position between the Appraisal Consultation Document and the Final Appraisal Determination. It ultimately recommended that golimumab be provided as an option for the treatment of active and progressive PsA in adults only if (i) it is used as described for other tumour necrosis factor inhibitor treatments in 'Etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis' (NICE clinical guideline 199); and (ii) the manufacturer provides the 100?mg dose of golimumab at the same cost as the 50?mg dose.",2012-01-08568,22283690,Pharmacoeconomics,Huiqin Yang,2011,/,,Yes,22283690,"Huiqin Yang; Dawn Craig; David Epstein; Laura Bojke; Kate Light; Ian N Bruce; Mark Sculpher; Nerys Woolacott; Golimumab for the Treatment of Psoriatic Arthritis: A NICE Single Technology Appraisal, Pharmacoeconomics, ; ():1179-2027",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Infliximab vs. Palliative care (usual care including NSAIDs or DMARDs),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,23578,United Kingdom,2010,43202.48
9393,Comparing health outcomes and costs of general vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in sweden: a markov model,"Two new pneumococcal conjugate vaccines were licensed to immunize infants and young children against pneumococcal disease.The objective of this study was to estimate the expected health benefits, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness of routine vaccination with the 10-valent pneumococcal nontypeable hemophilus influenza protein-D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) compared with the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in Sweden.A Markov cohort model was used to estimate the effect of vaccination at vaccine steady state, taking a societal perspective and using a 2+1 vaccination schedule. Price parity was assumed between the vaccines. Outcomes were measured by reduction in disease burden, costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.The results predicted that PCV13 would prevent 3 additional cases of invasive pneumococcal disease and 34 additional cases of pneumonia, whereas PHiD-CV would avoid 3 additional cases of mastoiditis, 1010 tube insertions, and 10,420 cases of ambulatory acute otitis media compared with PCV13. By combining morbidity and mortality benefits of all clinical outcomes, PHiD-CV would generate 45.3 additional QALYs compared with PCV13 and generate savings of an estimated 62 million Swedish kronors.The present study predicted lower costs and better health outcome (QALYs) gained by introducing PHiD-CV compared with PCV13 in routine vaccination.
