24301,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Pembrolizumab for bacillus Calmette-Guérin-Unresponsive Carcinoma In Situ of the Bladder,"PURPOSE: Patients with bacillus Calmette-Guérin-unresponsive carcinoma in situ are treated with radical cystectomy or salvage intravesical chemotherapy. Recently, pembrolizumab was approved for bacillus Calmette-Guérin-unresponsive carcinoma in situ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a decision-analytic Markov model to compare pembrolizumab, salvage intravesical chemotherapy (with gemcitabine-docetaxel induction+monthly maintenance) and radical cystectomy for patients with bacillus Calmette-Guérin-unresponsive carcinoma in situ who are radical cystectomy candidates (index patient 1) or are unwilling/unable to undergo radical cystectomy (index patient 2). The model used a U.S. Medicare perspective with a 5-year time horizon. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were compared using a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year. RESULTS: For index patient 1, pembrolizumab was not cost-effective relative to radical cystectomy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios $1,403,008/quality-adjusted life year) or salvage intravesical chemotherapy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios $2,011,923/quality-adjusted life year). One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that pembrolizumab only became cost-effective relative to radical cystectomy with a >93% price reduction. Relative to radical cystectomy, salvage intravesical chemotherapy was cost-effective for time horizons <5 years and nearly cost-effective at 5 years (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios $118,324/quality-adjusted life year). One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that salvage intravesical chemotherapy became cost-effective relative to radical cystectomy if risk of recurrence or metastasis at 2 years was less than 55% or 5.9%, respectively. For index patient 2, pembrolizumab required >90% price reduction to be cost-effective (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios $1,073,240/quality-adjusted life year). Pembrolizumab was cost-effective in 0% of 100,000 microsimulations in probabilistic sensitivity analyses for both index patients. CONCLUSIONS: At its current price, pembrolizumab is not cost-effective for bacillus Calmette-Guérin-unresponsive carcinoma in situ relative to radical cystectomy or salvage intravesical chemotherapy. Although gemcitabine-docetaxel is not cost-effective relative to radical cystectomy at 5 years, further studies may validate its cost-effectiveness if recurrence and metastasis thresholds are met.",2020-01-34077,33347775,J Urol,Kevin M Wymer,2020,/,101097JU0000000000001515,No,33347775,"Kevin M Wymer; Vidit Sharma; Christopher S Saigal; Karim Chamie; Mark S Litwin; Vignesh T Packiam; Matthew Mossanen; Lance C Pagliaro; Bijan J Borah; Stephen A Boorjian; Steven D Criss; Lauren Palazzo; Tina R Watson; Adelle M Paquette; Keith Sigel; Juan Wisnivesky; Chung Yin Kong; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Pembrolizumab for bacillus Calmette-Guérin-Unresponsive Carcinoma In Situ of the Bladder, J Urol, 2020 Dec 21; ():0022-5347; 101097JU0000000000001515",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,"Pharmaceutical, Surgical",salvage intravesical chemotherapy vs. radical cystectomy,"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-unresponsive carcinoma in situ, radical cystectomy candidate",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,137366.67,United States,2019,139061.34

24304,Cost-Effectiveness of Lenvatinib Compared with Sorafenib for the First-Line Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Australia,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In the REFLECT trial, lenvatinib showed superior clinical benefits to sorafenib in terms of progression-free survival and was non-inferior for overall survival in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We assessed the cost-effectiveness of lenvatinib compared with sorafenib for patients with advanced HCC in Australia. METHOD: A partitioned-survival model was built to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing lenvatinib and sorafenib from an Australian health-system perspective. Survival curves were obtained from the REFLECT trial and fitted with parametric survival functions for extrapolation purposes beyond the trial follow-up. Cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were accrued over the 10-year time horizon of the model. Deterministic and probability sensitivity analysis (PSA) were carried out to verify the validity of the model. RESULTS: Lenvatinib incurred higher costs (A$96,325) and superior health outcomes (QALYs: 1.205), while sorafenib had lower costs (A$92,394) and inferior health outcomes (QALYs: 1.086). Thus, lenvatinib yielded an incremental cost-utility ratio of A$33,028/QALY gained. Further, the results of the PSA found that the probability of lenvatinib being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of A$50,000/QALY was 64%. CONCLUSION: Our study found that, at current prices, lenvatinib is a cost-effective treatment option compared with sorafenib for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced HCC.",2020-01-34079,33140194,Clin Drug Investig,Masnoon Saiyed,2020,40 / 12,1167-1176,Yes,33140194,"Masnoon Saiyed; Joshua Byrnes; Tushar Srivastava; Paul Scuffham; Martin Downes; Qiuping Zhong; Yuxi Tan; Wendong Chen; Huiqing Huang; Jing Huang; Sujuan Li; Ziwei Teng; Manjun Shen; Chujun Wu; Lu Wang; Song Cao; Jindong Chen; Haishan Wu; Hui Tang; Cost-Effectiveness of Lenvatinib Compared with Sorafenib for the First-Line Treatment of Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Australia, Clin Drug Investig, 2020 Dec; 40(12):1173-2563; 1167-1176",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,lenvatinib vs. sorafenib,"treatment-naive, advanced hepatocellular carcinoma",88 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,33028,Australia,2020,22827.07
24305,Cost-Effectiveness of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves symptoms and survival in patients with heart failure (HF). However, the CRT devices are costly and can impose a significant burden to the relatively constrained health budgets of middle-income countries such as Thailand. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of CRT in combination with optimal medical therapy (OMT) relative to patients with OMT alone. METHODS: A two-component model was used to analyze lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) from a healthcare perspective. Clinical inputs were mostly obtained from meta-analysis of landmark trials. All cost-related data, risk of non-cardiovascular death and readmission rate were based on Thai HF data. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3%. Findings were reported as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). A variety of sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: CRT plus OMT costs more than OMT (123,279 vs 11,165 THB or 3,972.90 vs 359.81 USD), and is more effective (3.57 QALYs vs 2.49 QALYs), yielding an ICER of 104,325 THB per QALY (3,362.07 USD per QALY). CRT was cost-effective at the Thai willingness to pay threshold of 160,000 THB per QALY (5,156.30 USD per QALY). The results were sensitive to cost of CRT maintenance. CONCLUSION: The use of CRT was associated with a cost-effectiveness ratio below generally accepted benchmarks for therapeutic interventions of 160,000 THB per QALY (5,156.30 USD per QALY). This suggests that the clinical benefits of CRT can be achieved at a reasonable cost in Thai HF patients.",2020-01-34080,33116697,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Unchalee Permsuwan,2020,12 /,579-588,No,33116697,"Unchalee Permsuwan; Arintaya Phrommintikul; Voratima Silavanich; Neil E Rens; Carin A Uyl-de Groot; Jeremy D Goldhaber-Fiebert; Julio Croda; Jason R Andrews; Sini Li; Liubao Peng; Chongqing Tan; Xiaohui Zeng; Xiaomin Wan; Xia Luo; Lidan Yi; Jianhe Li; Cost-Effectiveness of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Patients with Heart Failure in Thailand, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2020; 12():1178-6981; 579-588",QALY,Thailand,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Pharmaceutical",cardiac resynchronization therapy + optimal medical therapy vs. optimal medical therapy,"ejection fraction <=35%, in New York Heart Association class III or IV, prolonged QRS interval on electrocardiogram",65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,104325,Thailand,2019,3402.19
24306,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Preoperative Screening Strategies for Obstructive Sleep Apnea among Patients Undergoing Elective Inpatient Surgery,"BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is underdiagnosed in surgical patients. The cost-effectiveness of obstructive sleep apnea screening is unknown. This study''s objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of preoperative obstructive sleep apnea screening (1) perioperatively and (2) including patients'' remaining lifespans. METHODS: An individual-level Markov model was constructed to simulate the perioperative period and lifespan of patients undergoing inpatient elective surgery. Costs (2016 Canadian dollars) were calculated from the hospital perspective in a single-payer health system. Remaining model parameters were derived from a structured literature search. Candidate strategies included: (1) no screening; (2) STOP-Bang questionnaire alone; (3) STOP-Bang followed by polysomnography (STOP-Bang + polysomnography); and (4) STOP-Bang followed by portable monitor (STOP-Bang + portable monitor). Screen-positive patients (based on STOP-Bang cutoff of at least 3) received postoperative treatment modifications and expedited definitive testing. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life month in the perioperative analyses and quality-adjusted life years in the lifetime analyses. The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: In perioperative and lifetime analyses, no screening was least costly and least effective. STOP-Bang + polysomnography was the most effective strategy and was more cost-effective than both STOP-Bang + portable monitor and STOP-Bang alone in both analyses. In perioperative analyses, STOP-Bang + polysomnography was not cost-effective compared to no screening at the $4,167/quality-adjusted life month threshold (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $52,888/quality-adjusted life month). No screening was favored in more than 90% of iterations in probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In contrast, in lifetime analyses, STOP-Bang + polysomnography was favored compared to no screening at the $50,000/quality-adjusted life year threshold (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio $2,044/quality-adjusted life year). STOP-Bang + polysomnography was favored in most iterations at thresholds above $2,000/quality-adjusted life year in probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of preoperative obstructive sleep apnea screening differs depending on time horizon. Preoperative screening with STOP-Bang followed by immediate confirmatory testing with polysomnography is cost-effective on the lifetime horizon but not the perioperative horizon.

24309,Epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of universal meningitis b vaccination among college students prior to college entry,"OBJECTIVES: University students are at significantly higher risk of serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) infection, which can result in debilitating sequelae and excessive healthcare usage. This study aimed to elucidate the impact of universal pre-enrollment vaccination on MenB outbreak probability and the cost-effectiveness in outbreak-only scenarios. METHODS: We developed an infectious disease transmission model to determine the number of outbreaks averted under universal vaccination and a Markov model to simulate the costs accrued and QALYs lost associated with infection. The analysis was done on a hypothetical population of 40,000 college students over a four-year time frame. We used the outputs of these two models to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of universal MenB vaccination from a societal perspective. RESULTS: We find that the vaccination strategy was estimated to reduce MenB incidence by 63% and outbreak frequency rate by 90%. Under base case assumptions, the ICER of universal vaccination was $748,129 per QALY and in outbreak-only scenarios, it was cost-saving.

24311,Cost-Effectiveness of a Continuous Glucose Monitoring Mobile App for Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Analysis Simulation,"BACKGROUND: Apps for real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) on smartphones and other devices linked to CGM systems have recently been developed, and such CGM apps are also coming into use in Japan. In comparison with conventional retrospective CGM, the use of CGM apps improves patients'' own blood glucose control, which is expected to help slow the progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and prevent complications, but the effect of their introduction on medical costs remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our objective in this study was to perform an economic appraisal of CGM apps from the viewpoint of assessing public medical costs associated with type 2 DM, using the probability of developing type 2 DM-associated complications, and data on medical costs and utility value to carry out a medical cost simulation using a Markov model in order to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of the apps. METHODS: We developed a Markov model with the transition states of insulin therapy, nephrosis, dialysis, and cardiovascular disease, all of which have a major effect on medical costs, to identify changes in medical costs and utility values resulting from the introduction of a CGM app and calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The ICER for CGM app use was US $33,039/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitivity analyses showed that, with the exception of conditions where the transition probability of insulin therapy, utility value, or increased medical costs increases, the ICER for the introduction of CGM apps was below the threshold of US $43,478/QALY used by the Central Social Insurance Medical Council.

24312,Cost-Utility Analysis of Nivolumab in Adjuvant Treatment of Melanoma in France,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of the current study is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adjuvant treatment with nivolumab relative to clinically relevant comparators in adult patients with melanoma with lymph node involvement or metastatic disease who have undergone complete resection from a French societal perspective. METHODS: The comparators were observation, low-dose interferon and pembrolizumab. A subgroup analysis was carried out in patients with BRAF mutation, adding dabrafenib plus trametinib. A three-state partitioned survival model was developed to project costs and health benefits over a 20-year time horizon. Extrapolation for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was carried out using spline-based models. Because of the immaturity of OS data in pivotal trials for nivolumab and pembrolizumab, a predictive model of OS treatment effect based on RFS effect was developed using a correlation equation. Health state utilities and adverse events disutilities were derived from the CheckMate 238 trial and literature. Costs were estimated in 2019 euros. The model''s primary outcome was efficiency frontier. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of results. RESULTS: Observation, low-dose interferon and nivolumab were on the efficiency frontier. The incremental cost-utility ratio of nivolumab versus low-dose interferon (closest therapy on the efficiency frontier) was €37,886/quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis reported an 80% probability of nivolumab being a cost-effective strategy for a willingness-to-pay threshold of €52,000/QALY.

24315,Epidemiological impact and cost-effectiveness of varicella vaccination strategies in the United Kingdom (UK),"BACKGROUND: Despite the burden of varicella, there is no universal varicella vaccination (UVV) programme in the United Kingdom (UK) due to concerns this could increase herpes zoster (HZ) incidence. This study assessed the cost-utility of a first-dose monovalent (V) or quadrivalent (MMRV) followed by a second-dose quadrivalent (MMRV) UVV programmes. GSK and MSD varicella-containing vaccines (VCVs) were considered. METHODS: A dynamic transmission and cost-effectiveness models were adapted to the UK. Outcomes measured included varicella and HZ incidences, the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICURs) over a lifetime horizon. The payer and societal perspectives were evaluated. RESULTS: The impact of V-MMRV and MMRV-MMRV UVV programmes on varicella incidence was comparable between both VCVs at equilibrium. HZ incidence increased by 1.6%-1.7% over seven years after UVV start, regardless of the strategies, then decreased by >95% at equilibrium. ICURs ranged from £5,665 (100 years) to £18,513 (20 years) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with V-MMRV; and from £9,220 to £27,101 per QALY gained with MMRV-MMRV (payer perspective). MMRV-MMRV was cost-effective in medium- and long-terms with GSK VCV, and only cost-effective at long-term with MSD VCV at £20,000 per QALY gained threshold. Without the exogenous boosting hypothesis, HZ incidence decreased through UVV implementation. ICURs were most sensitive to discount rates and MMRV price.

24339,The cost-effectiveness of food consistency modification with xanthan gum-based Nutilis Clear® in patients with post-stroke dysphagia in Poland,"BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a well-known stroke complication characterised by difficulty in swallowing. It may affect the majority of stroke patients and increases mortality and morbidity, due to aspiration pneumonia and malnutrition. Food thickening may help patients to feed themselves, and its effectiveness was demonstrated. However, the cost-effectiveness studies are lacking. We evaluate the cost-utility of xanthan gum-based consistency modification therapy (Nutilis Clear®) in adult post-stroke patients from the public payer perspective in Poland. METHODS: Routine clinical practice was used as a comparator, as no alternative specific treatment for dysphagia is available. To verify the robustness of the results against the modelling approach, we built two models: a static (a fixed simple-equations model, 8-week time horizon of dysphagia) and a dynamic one (Markov model, with a possible dysphagia resolution over a 1-year horizon). In both models, the treatment costs, health state utilities, and clinical events (i.e. aspiration, aspiration pneumonia, death) were included. Parameters were estimated jointly for both models, except for the duration of dysphagia and the risk of aspiration pneumonia (specific to the time horizon). We only assumed Nutilis Clear® to prevent aspirations, without affecting dysphagia duration. RESULTS: The average cost of one quality-adjusted life year (i.e. the incremental cost-utility ratios, ICURs) amounted to 21,387 PLN (€1?˜?4.5 PLN), and 20,977 PLN in static and dynamic model, respectively; far below the cost-effectiveness threshold in Poland (147,024 PLN).

In this study, we constructed a Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of Pola-BR versus BR in transplant-ineligible R/R DLBCL. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each treatment strategy from a US payer perspective, using a lifetime horizon and a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Use of Pola-BR was associated with an incremental cost of $92,641 compared to BR alone ($200,905 vs $108,265, respectively), an incremental effectiveness of 1.76 QALYs (2.35 vs 0.59 QALYs, respectively), and an ICER of $52,519/QALY.

24342,Cost Effectiveness of Voretigene Neparvovec for RPE65-Mediated Inherited Retinal Degeneration in Germany,"PURPOSE: Voretigene Neparvovec-rzyl (VN) is the first available treatment for biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated inherited retinal degeneration, which is usually associated with infancy-onset severe visual impairment and complete blindness during the third life decade. We aim to estimate the cost effectiveness of VN in Germany considering medication costs of €410,550 per eye and potential indirect cost offsets by higher labor force participation. METHODS: We developed an individual patient sampling model to simulate patients over their lifetime. In a Monte Carlo analysis, 1000 simulations are performed. Cycle length of the two-state Markov model is 1 year. For each cycle, visual field and best-corrected visual acuity are tracked, compared with natural progression and converted to quality of life. Direct and indirect costs are recorded and the incremental cost-utility ratio is calculated. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, VN provides 4.82 additional quality-adjusted life-years over a patient''s lifetime at an incremental cost-utility ratio of €156,853 per additional quality-adjusted life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses show the robustness of the results when altering treatment effect duration, discounting of quality-adjusted life-years and costs, direct costs, and natural progression. CONCLUSIONS: Under a lifetime perspective, VN proves to be cost effective for the German statutory health insurance system despite high initial treatment costs. Because VN has important implications for future gene therapies, cost-utility analyses have high economic relevance from a societal perspective.

24343,Cost-effectiveness of an indicated preventive intervention for depression in adolescents: a model to support decision making,"BACKGROUND: Adolescent depression has negative health and economic outcomes in the short- and long-term. Indicated preventive interventions, in particular group based cognitive behavioural therapy (GB-CBT), are effective in preventing depression in adolescents with subsyndromal depression. However, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was used to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses comparing a GB-CBT indicated preventive intervention for depression, to a no-intervention option in a Swedish setting. Taking a time horizon of 5- and 10 years, incremental differences in societal costs and health benefits expressed as differences in the proportion of cases of depression prevented, and as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were estimated. Through univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, the robustness of the results was explored. Costs, presented in 2018 USD, and effects were discounted at a yearly rate of 3%. RESULTS: The base-case analysis showed that GB-CBT indicated preventive intervention incurred lower costs, prevented a larger proportion of cases of depression and generated higher QALYs compared to the no-intervention option for both time horizons. Offering the intervention was even a cost saving strategy and demonstrated a probability of being cost-effective of over 95%. In the sensitivity analyses, these results were robust to the modelling assumptions.

24347,Lifetime cost-effectiveness and equity impacts of the Healthy Primary School of the Future initiative,"BACKGROUND: This study estimated the lifetime cost-effectiveness and equity impacts associated with two lifestyle interventions in the Dutch primary school setting (targeting 4-12?year olds). METHODS: The Healthy Primary School of the Future (HPSF; a healthy school lunch and structured physical activity) and the Physical Activity School (PAS; structured physical activity) were compared to the regular Dutch curriculum (N?=?1676). An adolescence model, calculating weight development, and the RIVM Chronic Disease Model, calculating overweight-related chronic diseases, were linked to estimate the lifetime impact on chronic diseases, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare, and productivity costs. Cost-effectiveness was expressed as the additional costs/QALY gained and we used €20,000 as threshold. Scenario analyses accounted for alternative effect maintenance scenarios and equity analyses examined cost-effectiveness in different socioeconomic status (SES) groups. RESULTS: HPSF resulted in a lifetime costs of €773 (societal perspective) and a lifetime QALY gain of 0.039 per child versus control schools. HPSF led to lower costs and more QALYs as compared to PAS. From a societal perspective, HPSF had a cost/QALY gained of €19,734 versus control schools, 50% probability of being cost-effective, and beneficial equity impact (0.02 QALYs gained/child for low versus high SES). The cost-effectiveness threshold was surpassed when intervention effects decayed over time. CONCLUSIONS: HPSF may be a cost-effective and equitable strategy for combatting the lifetime burden of unhealthy lifestyles.

24351,Cost-utility analysis of an integrated care program for children with asthma in a medium-income country,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-utility of an integrated care program (ASMAIRE Infantil Program [PAI]) for children with asthma compared with standard of care. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to compare an integrated care program compared to the standard of care in children with asthma in Bogota, Colombia. Baseline characteristics of the patients were established according to the distribution of patients in the PAI database. Other inputs were obtained from published meta-analysis, local registries, medical bills, general mortality data, and expert opinion. Costs were presented in 2017 Colombian pesos. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Costs and outcomes were discounted by 5% per year. Incremental cost-utility ratios were presented for PAI compared with standard of care. Univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model robustness to parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: The model predicted that patients that are part of the PAI would accrue more QALYs than patients on standard of care. The incremental results suggest that the PAI is a cost-effective treatment (incremental cost-utility ratio of Colombian pesos $33?753?817/QALY) compared with standard of care. Sensitivity analyses suggest that results are most sensitive to cost of care (with and without PAI) and costs of severe exacerbation. However, the PAI is cost-effective irrespective of variation in any of the input parameters. CONCLUSION: Our model predicted that an integrated intervention for the management of asthma in pediatric patients improves QALYs, reduces number of disease related exacerbations compared to standard therapy and is cost-effective for the long-term control of the disease in Colombia.",2020-01-34117,33460317,Pediatr Pulmonol,Elida Duenas-Meza,2020,55 / 11,3110-3118,No,33460317,"Elida Duenas-Meza; Luis F Giraldo-Cadavid; Elizabeth Karpf; Felipe Afanador; Olga L Angarita; Oscar Barón; Maria S Medina; Angelica Pachón; Angelica Gonzalez; Jenny Jurado; Carlos A Torres-Duque; Cost-utility analysis of an integrated care program for children with asthma in a medium-income country, Pediatr Pulmonol, 2020 Nov; 55(11):1099-0496; 3110-3118",QALY,Colombia,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior",integrated care asthma program vs. Standard/Usual Care- inhaled corticosteroids / inhaled corticosteroids + long-acting beta-agonists; short-acting beta-agonist or systemic corticosteroid,Bogota,7 Years,7 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,5.00,5.00,33753817,Colombia,2017,12081.66
24352,Cost-effectiveness analysis of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus folfirinox in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer in china,"OBJECTIVES: Nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane®) plus gemcitabine (AG) and Fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) have shown significant clinical benefit and been widely used as 1(st)-line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC) in China. This study aims to compare the cost-effectiveness of AG versus FOLFIRINOX regimen for the treatment of mPC patients in China. METHODS: Markov model was developed with a lifetime survival projection in Microsoft Excel® to simulate the progression of the mPC over time. The quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resource consumption in the health care sector and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were reported. Uncertainty was assessed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: AG regimen provided an effectiveness of 1.35 QALY at an average cost of USD 22,300 whereas FOLFIRINOX regimen brought 0.82 QALY at a cost of USD 22,980 in lifetime horizon. Therefore, AG regimen was dominant with an ICER of USD -1300 compared with FOLFIRINOX regimen. AG arm generated less drug cost, medical cost, hospitalization cost, and end-of-life cost than FOLFIRINOX arm did. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of base case findings.

24353,Cost-effectiveness of guideline-based stepped and collaborative care versus treatment as usual for patients with depression - a cluster-randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: Depression is associated with major patient burden. Its treatment requires complex and collaborative approaches. A stepped care model based on the German National Clinical Practice Guideline ""Unipolar Depression"" has been shown to be effective. In this study we assess the cost-effectiveness of this guideline based stepped care model versus treatment as usual in depression. METHODS: This prospective cluster-randomized controlled trial included 737 depressive adult patients. Primary care practices were randomized to an intervention (IG) or a control group (CG). The intervention consisted of a four-level stepped care model. The CG received treatment as usual. A cost-utility analysis from the societal perspective with a time horizon of 12?months was performed. We used quality-adjusted life years (QALY) based on the EQ-5D-3L as effect measure. Resource utilization was assessed by patient questionnaires. Missing values were imputed by ''multiple imputation using chained equations'' based on predictive mean matching. We calculated adjusted group differences in costs and effects as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. To describe the statistical and decision uncertainty cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed based on net-benefit regressions with bootstrapped standard errors (1000 replications). The complete sample and subgroups based on depression severity were considered. RESULTS: We found no statically significant differences in costs and effects between IG and CG. The incremental total societal costs (+€5016; 95%-CI: [-€259;€10,290) and effects (+?0.008 QALY; 95%-CI: [-?0.030; 0.046]) were higher in the IG in comparison to the CG. Significantly higher costs were found in the IG for outpatient physician services and psychiatrist services in comparison to the CG. Significantly higher total costs and productivity losses in the IG in comparison to the CG were found in the group with severe depression. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the IG in comparison to the CG were unfavourable (complete sample: €627.000/QALY gained; mild depression: dominated; moderately severe depression: €645.154/QALY gained; severe depression: €2082,714/QALY gained) and the probability of cost-effectiveness of the intervention was low, except for the group with moderate depression (ICER: dominance; 70% for willingness-to-pay threshold of €50,000/QALY gained).

This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of HA for older adults who were volunteered to be screened for hearing loss in a community-based mobile hearing clinic (MHC). METHODS: Participants with (1) at least moderate hearing loss (=40?dB HL) in at least one ear, (2) no prior usage of HA, (3) no ear related medical complications, and (4) had a Mini-Mental State Examination score?=?18 were eligible for this study. Using a delayed-start study design, participants were randomized into the immediate-start (Fitted) group where HA was fitted immediately or the delayed-start (Not Fitted) group where HA fitting was delayed for three months. Cost utility analysis was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of being fitted with HA combined with short-term, aural rehabilitation with the routine care group who were not fitted with HA. Incremental cost effectiveness ration (ICER) was computed. Health Utility Index (HUI-3) was used to measure utility gain, a component required to derive the quality adjusted life years (QALY). Total costs included direct healthcare costs, direct non-healthcare costs and indirect costs (productivity loss of participant and caregiver). Demographic data was collected during the index visit to MHC. Cost and utility data were collected three months after index visit and projected to five years. RESULTS: There were 264 participants in the Fitted group and 163 participants in the Not Fitted group. No between-group differences in age, gender, ethnicity, housing type and degree of hearing loss were observed at baseline. At 3?months, HA fitting led to a mean utility increase of 0.12 and an ICER gain of S$42,790/QALY (95% CI: S$32, 793/QALY to S$62,221/QALY). At five years, the ICER was estimated to be at S$11,964/QALY (95% CI: S$8996/QALY to S$17,080/QALY) assuming 70% of the participants continued using the HA.

24356,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis from a Randomized Controlled Trial of Tailored Exercise Prescription for Women with Breast Cancer with 8-Year Follow-Up,"Studies show conflicting results on whether exercise interventions to improve outcomes for women with breast cancer are cost-effective. We modelled the long-term cost-effectiveness of the Exercise for Health intervention compared with usual care. A lifetime Markov cohort model for women with early breast cancer was constructed taking a societal perspective. Data were obtained from trial, epidemiological, quality of life, and healthcare cost reports. Outcomes were calculated from 5000 Monte Carlo simulations, and one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Over the cohort''s remaining life, the incremental cost for the exercise versus usual care groups were $7409 and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained were 0.35 resulting in an incremental cost per QALY ratio of AU$21,247 (95% Uncertainty Interval (UI): Dominant, AU$31,398). The likelihood that the exercise intervention was cost-effective at acceptable levels was 93.0%. The incremental cost per life year gained was AU$8894 (95% UI Dominant, AU$11,769) with a 99.4% probability of being cost effective. Findings were most sensitive to the probability of recurrence in the exercise and usual care groups, followed by the costs of out-of-pocket expenses and the model starting age.

24357,Cost-Effectiveness of an Antibacterial Envelope for Cardiac Implantable Electronic Device Infection Prevention in the US Healthcare System From the WRAP-IT Trial,"BACKGROUND: In the WRAP-IT trial (Worldwide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope Infection Prevention), adjunctive use of an absorbable antibacterial envelope resulted in a 40% reduction of major cardiac implantable electronic device infection without increased risk of complication in 6983 patients undergoing cardiac implantable electronic device revision, replacement, upgrade, or initial cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator implant. There is limited information on the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. As a prespecified objective, we evaluated antibacterial envelope cost-effectiveness compared with standard-of-care infection prevention strategies in the US healthcare system. METHODS: A decision tree model was used to compare costs and outcomes of antibacterial envelope (TYRX) use adjunctive to standard-of-care infection prevention versus standard-of-care alone over a lifelong time horizon. The analysis was performed from an integrated payer-provider network perspective. Infection rates, antibacterial envelope effectiveness, infection treatment costs and patterns, infection-related mortality, and utility estimates were obtained from the WRAP-IT trial. Life expectancy and long-term costs associated with device replacement, follow-up, and healthcare utilization were sourced from the literature. Costs and quality-adjusted life years were discounted at 3%. An upper willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per quality-adjusted life year was used to determine cost-effectiveness, in alignment with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines and as supported by the World Health Organization and contemporary literature. RESULTS: The base case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the antibacterial envelope compared with standard-of-care was $112 603/quality-adjusted life year. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio remained lower than the willingness-to-pay threshold in 74% of iterations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis and was most sensitive to the following model inputs: infection-related mortality, life expectancy, and infection cost. CONCLUSIONS: The absorbable antibacterial envelope was associated with a cost-effectiveness ratio below contemporary benchmarks in the WRAP-IT patient population, suggesting that the envelope provides value for the US healthcare system by reducing the incidence of cardiac implantable electronic device infection.

24358,Long-term cost-utility analysis of remote monitoring of older patients with pacemakers: the PONIENTE study,"BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness studies on pacemakers have increased in the last years. However the number of long-term cost-utility studies is limited. The objective of this study was to perform a cost-utility analysis comparing remote monitoring (RM) versus conventional monitoring (CM) in hospital of older patients with pacemakers, 5?years after implant. METHODS: Under a controlled, not randomized, nor masked clinical trial, 83 patients with pacemakers were initially selected. After five years of follow-up, a total of 55 patients (CM?=?34; RM?=?21) completed the study. A cost-utility analysis of RM in terms of costs per gained quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) was conducted. The costs from the Public Health System (PHS) as well as patients and their relatives were taken into account for the study. The robustness of the results was verified by the probabilistic analyses through Monte-Carlo simulations. RESULTS: After a five-year follow-up period, total costs were lower in the RM group by 23.02% than in the CM group (€274.52 versus €356.62; p?=?0.033) because of a cost saving from patients'' perspective (€59.05 versus €102.98; p?=?0.002). However, the reduction of in-hospital visits derived from RM exhibited insignificant impact on the costs from the PHS perspective, with a cost saving of 15.04% (€215.48 vs. €253.64; p?=?0.144). Costs/QALYs obtained by the RM group were higher as compared to the CM group, although there were no significant differences. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of CM in comparison to RM became positive (€301.16). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms RM of older patients with pacemakers appears still as a cost-utility alternative to CM in hospital after 5?years of follow-up.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of F&A in the first-line treatment for PMW-MBC (HR+) in China. DESIGN: We constructed a Markov model over a life-time horizon. The clinical outcomes and utility data were obtained from published literature. Cost data were obtained from official Chinese websites. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test result uncertainty. SETTING: Chinese healthcare system perspective. POPULATION: A hypothetical cohort of adult patients presenting with PMW-MBC (HR+). INTERVENTIONS: F&A compared with full-dose FUL and ANAmonotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome of this study was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). RESULTS: ANA was estimated to have the lowest cost and minimum life-years. The ICER of F&A versus ANA was US$15 665.891/QALY with incremental cost and QALY of US$12 401.120 and 0.792, respectively, which was less than the willingness-to-pay of US$29 383/QALY. Compared with F&A, FUL yielded a higher cost and a shorter lifetime; hence, it was identified as a dominated strategy. The univariate sensitivity analysis indicated the price of FUL was the most influential factor in our study. The probability that F&A was cost-effective at a threshold of US$29 383/QALY in China was 86.5%. CONCLUSION: F&A is a cost-effective alternative to FUL and ANA monotherapy for the first-line treatment of PMW-MBC (HR+) in China.

24361,Costing the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Exploratory Economic Evaluation of Hypothetical Suppression Policy in the United Kingdom,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to cost and calculate the relative cost-effectiveness of the hypothetical suppression policies found in the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team model. METHODS: Key population-level disease projections in deaths, intensive care unit bed days, and non-intensive care unit bed days were taken from the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report of March 2020, which influenced the decision to introduce suppression policies in the United Kingdom. National income loss estimates were from a study that estimated the impact of a hypothetical pandemic on the UK economy, with sensitivity analyses based on projections that are more recent. Individual quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) loss and costed resource use inputs were taken from published sources. RESULTS: Imperial model projected suppression polices compared to an unmitigated pandemic, even with the most pessimistic national income loss scenarios under suppression (10%), give incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below £50 000 per QALY. Assuming a maximum reduction in national income of 7.75%, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for Imperial model projected suppression versus mitigation are below 60 000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Results are uncertain and conditional on the accuracy of the Imperial model projections; they are also sensitive to estimates of national income loss.

24365,Impact of quadrivalent influenza vaccines in Brazil: a cost-effectiveness analysis using an influenza transmission model,"BACKGROUND: Influenza epidemics significantly weight on the Brazilian healthcare system and its society. Public health authorities have progressively expanded recommendations for vaccination against influenza, particularly to the pediatric population. However, the potential mismatch between the trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) strains and those circulating during the season remains an issue. Quadrivalent vaccines improves vaccines effectiveness by preventing any potential mismatch on influenza B lineages. METHODS: We evaluate the public health and economic benefits of the switch from TIV to QIV for the pediatric influenza recommendation (6mo-5yo) by using a dynamic epidemiological model able to consider the indirect impact of vaccination. Results of the epidemiological model are then imputed in a health-economic model adapted to the Brazilian context. We perform deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis to account for both epidemiological and economical sources of uncertainty. RESULTS: Our results show that switching from TIV to QIV in the Brazilian pediatric population would prevent 406,600 symptomatic cases, 11,300 hospitalizations and almost 400 deaths by influenza season. This strategy would save 3400 life-years yearly for an incremental direct cost of R$169 million per year, down to R$86 million from a societal perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the switch would be R$49,700 per life-year saved and R$26,800 per quality-adjusted life-year gained from a public payer perspective, and even more cost-effective from a societal perspective. Our results are qualitatively similar in our sensitivity analysis.

24367,Exploring the cost-effectiveness of advance care planning (by taking a family carer perspective): Findings of an economic modelling study,"Advance care planning is considered an important part of high-quality end-of-life care. Its cost-effectiveness is currently unknown. In this study, we explore the cost-effectiveness of a strategy, in which advance care planning is offered systematically to older people at the end-of-life compared with standard care. We conducted decision-analytic modelling. The perspective was health and social care and the time horizon was 1 year. Outcomes included were quality-adjusted life years as they referred to the surviving carers. Data sources included published studies, national statistics and expert views. Average total cost in the advance care planning versus standard care group was £3,739 versus £3,069. The quality-adjusted life year gain to carers was 0.03 for the intervention in comparison with the standard care group. Based on carer''s health-related quality-of-life, the average cost per quality-adjusted life year was £18,965. The probability that the intervention was cost-effective was 55% (70%) at a cost per quality-adjusted life year threshold of £20,000 (£30,000). Conducting cost-effectiveness analysis for advance care planning is challenging due to uncertainties in practice and research, such as a lack of agreement on how advance care planning should be provided and by whom (which influences its costs), and about relevant beneficiary groups (which influences its outcomes). However, even when assuming relatively high costs for the delivery of advance care planning and only one beneficiary group, namely, family carers, our analysis showed that advance care planning was probably cost-effective.",2020-01-34146,32783319,Health Soc Care Community,Annette Bauer,2020,/,,No,32783319,"Annette Bauer; Josie Dixon; Martin Knapp; Raphael Wittenberg; Exploring the cost-effectiveness of advance care planning (by taking a family carer perspective): Findings of an economic modelling study, Health Soc Care Community, 2020 Aug 11; ():1365-2524",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Care Delivery,advance care planning vs. Standard/Usual care,end of life,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,22333.33,United Kingdom,2016,32645.06
24368,Should the Government Be Allowed to Take Control over Your Car as Part of a Disaster Management Plan?,"INTRODUCTION: With the Safety Ensuring Lives Future Deployment and Research in Vehicle Evolution (SELF DRIVE) Act in the United States, there is a growing interest in autonomous vehicles (AVs). One avenue of innovation would be to use them to mobilize and coordinate response efforts during natural disasters. This study uses an earthquake response in an urban, developed setting as a hypothetical example case study. In this hypothetical scenario, private AVs would be mobilized to help rescue victims from collapsed structures. METHODS: A Markov model compared an intervention arm with AVs to a status quo arm using a hypothetical cohort of American earthquake victims. The three possible health states were trapped but alive, rescued and alive, and dead. The cycle length of the Markov model was 6 h. RESULTS: The cost of deploying AVs was $90,139 relative to $87,869 in status quo arm. Using AVs produced an incremental cost of $2269 (95% credible interval (CI) = $-12,985-$8959). Victims have 7.33 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the intervention arm compared to 7.20 QALYs in the status quo arm, resulting in an incremental gain of 0.13 (95% CI = -0.73-2.19) QALYs.

24369,Sequencing Systemic Therapy Pathways for Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Cost Effectiveness Analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common form of liver cancer worldwide and carries a poor prognosis. Historically, sorafenib was the only available systemic treatment for advanced HCC. However, in recent years, 6 new treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): regorafenib, lenvatinib, cabozantinib, pembrolizumab, ramucirumab, and nivolumab. Data are lacking regarding the most appropriate sequencing pathway for these agents. Our objective was to conduct a comprehensive cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) of different 1st- and 2nd-line treatment pathways for HCC reflecting all new drug approvals, and then use our data to provide guidance for clinicians on which pathway is the most cost-effective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Markov models were used to evaluate the cost effectiveness of 8 different 1st- and 2nd-line treatment sequences. The model allowed for 9 possible states. Cost effectiveness ratios (CER) and incremental CER (ICER) were calculated to compare costs between different pathways and against a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. Efficacy and toxicity data were extracted from the landmark trials for each agent. All agents except ramucirumab were included. The cost of each agent was based on the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) in USD as of June 2019. Monte-Carlo methods were used to simulate the experience of 1,000,000 patients per treatment sequence for a 12-month period. RESULTS: The pathway with the lowest CER was sorafenib, followed by pembrolizumab (USD 227,741.03/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). ICER analysis supported implementing 2nd-line pembrolizumab-based pathways at a higher WTP threshold of 300,000/quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis did not substantially change these results. CONCLUSIONS: The most cost-effective strategy was 1st-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy followed by 2nd-line immunotherapy.

The cost of each agent was based on the wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) in USD as of June 2019. Monte-Carlo methods were used to simulate the experience of 1,000,000 patients per treatment sequence for a 12-month period. RESULTS: The pathway with the lowest CER was sorafenib, followed by pembrolizumab (USD 227,741.03/quality-adjusted life year [QALY]). ICER analysis supported implementing 2nd-line pembrolizumab-based pathways at a higher WTP threshold of 300,000/quality-adjusted life year. Sensitivity analysis did not substantially change these results. CONCLUSIONS: The most cost-effective strategy was 1st-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy followed by 2nd-line immunotherapy. All pathways exceeded a commonly accepted WTP of USD 100-150,000/QALY.

The current study examined the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with the EXTREME regimen in patients with HNSCC from the perspectives of USA and China. METHODS: A partitioned survival model was implemented for patients with R/M HNSCC, and the cost effectiveness of pembrolizumab monotherapy and pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy compared with the EXTREME regimen was compared. Survival information was derived from the KEYNOTE-048 trial. The model was designed as a 20-year time horizon, a 3-week cycle, and a 3% discount rate for costs and utilities. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) value less than $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) was considered cost effective in the USA and $27,538/QALY in China. We analyzed the uncertainty by performing one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: From the base-case analysis, we found that the pembrolizumab monotherapy scheme had a lower cost and better efficacy compared with the EXTREME regimen in the USA. In China, the ICER of the comparison was $62,401/QALY. The ICER of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy vs the EXTREME regimen was $66,630/QALY in the USA and $90,538/QALY in China.

24389,Cost Effectiveness of Genotype-Guided Antiplatelet Therapy in Asian Ischemic Stroke Patients: Ticagrelor as an Alternative to Clopidogrel in Patients with CYP2C19 Loss of Function Mutations,"BACKGROUND: Patients with ischemic stroke are often treated with clopidogrel monotherapy as part of secondary stroke prevention. The prevalence of loss of function (LOF) mutations in the CYP2C19 gene is higher in Asians than in Western populations. Patients with loss of function (LOF) mutations are at risk for poorer secondary outcomes when prescribed clopidogrel. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy in an Asian population with the aim of prescribing ticagrelor as an alternative to patients with LOF mutations. METHODS: Markov models were developed to look at the cost effectiveness of genetic testing of CYP2C19, with patients who screened positive for LOF alleles being switched to ticagrelor compared to universal clopidogrel treatment. Effect ratios were obtained from the literature and incidence rates and costs were obtained from the national data published by the Singapore Ministry of Health. Lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated. The primary endpoints were the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: The prevalence of the LOF mutations was 61% in the population, with 65% of ethnic Chinese, 60% of ethnic Indian, and 53% of ethnic Malay patients having LOF mutations. Based on this prevalence, the overall ICER of genetic testing was S$33,839/QALY with ICERS of S$30,755/QALY, S$33,177/QALY, and S$41,470/QALY for Chinese, Indians, and Malays, respectively.

24391,Cost Effectiveness of Genotype-Guided Antiplatelet Therapy in Asian Ischemic Stroke Patients: Ticagrelor as an Alternative to Clopidogrel in Patients with CYP2C19 Loss of Function Mutations,"BACKGROUND: Patients with ischemic stroke are often treated with clopidogrel monotherapy as part of secondary stroke prevention. The prevalence of loss of function (LOF) mutations in the CYP2C19 gene is higher in Asians than in Western populations. Patients with loss of function (LOF) mutations are at risk for poorer secondary outcomes when prescribed clopidogrel. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the cost effectiveness of genotype-guided antiplatelet therapy in an Asian population with the aim of prescribing ticagrelor as an alternative to patients with LOF mutations. METHODS: Markov models were developed to look at the cost effectiveness of genetic testing of CYP2C19, with patients who screened positive for LOF alleles being switched to ticagrelor compared to universal clopidogrel treatment. Effect ratios were obtained from the literature and incidence rates and costs were obtained from the national data published by the Singapore Ministry of Health.

24393,Cost-effectiveness of the PDSAFE personalised physiotherapy intervention for fall prevention in Parkinson's: an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: PDSAFE is an individually-tailored, physiotherapist-delivered, balance, strength and strategy training programme aimed at preventing falls among people with Parkinson''s. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of PDSAFE compared with usual care for people with Parkinson''s at higher risk of falling, from a UK National Health Service and Personal Social Service perspective. METHODS: Resource use and quality of life data (EQ-5D-3L) were collected from 238 participants randomised to the PDSAFE intervention and 236 participants randomised to control, at baseline, 3?months, 6?months (primary outcome), and 12?months. Adjusted cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated using generalised linear models and uncertainty estimated using a non-parametric bootstrap. RESULTS: Over 6 months, the PDSAFE intervention was associated with an incremental cost of £925 (95% CI £428 to £1422) and a very small and statistically insignificant QALY gain of 0.008 (95% CI -?0.006 to 0.021). The resulting incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was £120,659 per QALY and the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at a UK threshold of £30,000/QALY was less than 1%. The ICER varied substantially across subgroups although no subgroup had an ICER lower than the £30,000 threshold. The result was sensitive to the time horizon with the ICER reducing to £55,176 per QALY when adopting a 12-month time horizon and assuming a sustained treatment effect on QoL, nevertheless, the intervention was still not cost-effective according to the current UK threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this trial suggests that the PDSAFE intervention is unlikely to be cost-effective at 6 months. The 12-month analysis suggested that the intervention became closer to being cost-effective if quality of life effects were sustained beyond the intervention period, however this would require confirmation. Further research, including qualitative studies, should be conducted to better understand the treatment effect of physiotherapy and its impact on quality of life in people with Parkinson''s given existing mixed evidence on this topic.

24397,Cost-effectiveness analysis of combining traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of hypertension: compound Apocynum tablets combined with Nifedipine sustained-release tablets vs Nifedipine sustained-release tablets alone,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) and to compare the cost-effectiveness of a combined treatment consisting of compound Apocynum tablets and Nifedipine sustained-release tablets with the cost-effectiveness of treatment with Nifedipine sustained-release tablets alone. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the potential incremental cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to be gained from compound Apocynum tablets and Nifedipine sustained-release tablets compared with Nifedipine sustained-release tablets alone. Model parameter estimates were informed by previously published studies. The direct medical costs of outpatients with hypertension were estimated from the health care provider''s perspective. A 5% annual discount rate was applied to both costs and QALYs. RESULTS: TCMs combined with Nifedipine sustained-release tablets group generated a total 20-year cost of 11,517.94 RMB (US $1739.87), whereas Nifedipine sustained-release tablets alone group resulted in a 20-year cost of 7253.71 RMB (US $1095.73). TCMs combined with Nifedipine sustained-release tablets group resulted in a generation of 12.69 QALYs, whereas Nifedipine sustained-release tablets alone group resulted in 12.50. The incremental cost-utility ratio was 22,443.32 RMB (US $3390.23) per QALY. Considering the threshold of 1 GDP per capita in China in 2018 (US $9764.95), the combination of compound Apocynum tablets and Nifedipine sustained-release tablets was a cost-effective strategy.

This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of PrEP in men who have sex with men (MSM), a major risk group emerging in Korea. A dynamic compartmental model was developed for HIV transmission and progression in MSM aged 15-64 years. With a combined model including economic analysis, we estimated averted HIV infections, changes in HIV prevalence, discounted costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). PrEP was evaluated in both the general MSM and high-risk MSM populations and was assumed to reduce infection risk by 80%. Implementing PrEP in all MSM would avert 75.2% HIV infections and facilitate a gain of 37,372 QALYs at a cost of $274,822 per QALY gained over 20 years relative to the status quo. Initiating PrEP in high-risk MSM with an average of eight partners per year (around 20% of MSM) would improve the cost-effectiveness, averting 78.0% HIV infections and add 29,242 QALYs at a cost of $51,597 per QALY gained, which is within the willingness-to-pay threshold for Korea of $56,000/QALY gained. This result was highly sensitive to annual PrEP costs, quality-of-life for people who are on PrEP, and initial HIV prevalence.

24400,Toxicity reduction required for MRI-guided radiotherapy to be cost-effective in the treatment of localized prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the toxicity reduction required to justify the added costs of MRI-guided radiotherapy (MR-IGRT) over CT-based image guided radiotherapy (CT-IGRT) for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. METHODS: The costs of delivering prostate cancer radiotherapy with MR-IGRT and CT-IGRT in conventional 39 fractions and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) 5 fractions schedules were determined using literature values and cost accounting from two institutions. Gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicity rates associated with CT-IGRT were summarized from 20 studies. Toxicity-related costs and utilities were obtained from literature values and cost databases. Markov modeling was used to determine the savings per patient for every 1% relative reduction in acute and chronic toxicities by MR-IGRT over 15 years. The costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) saved with toxicity reduction were juxtaposed with the cost increase of MR-IGRT to determine toxicity reduction thresholds for cost-effectiveness. One way sensitivity analyses were performed. Standard $100,000 and $50,000 per QALY ratios were used. RESULTS: The added cost of MR-IGRT was $1,459 per course of SBRT and $10,129 per course of conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Relative toxicity reductions of 7 and 14% are required for SBRT to be cost-effective using $100,000 and $50,000 per QALY, respectively. Conventional radiotherapy requires relative toxicity reductions of 50 and 94% to be cost-effective. CONCLUSION: From a healthcare perspective, MR-IGRT can reasonably be expected to be cost-effective. Hypofractionated schedules, such a five fraction SBRT, are most likely to be cost-effective as they require only slight reductions in toxicity (7-14%).
