10001,Cost-effectiveness of confirmatory techniques for the placement of lumbar pedicle screws,"There is considerable variation in the use of adjunctive technologies to confirm pedicle screw placement. Although there is literature to support the use of both neurophysiological monitoring and isocentric fluoroscopy to confirm pedicle screw positioning, there are no studies examining the cost-effectiveness of these technologies. This study compares the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of isocentric O-arm fluoroscopy, neurophysiological monitoring, and postoperative CT scanning after multilevel instrumented fusion for degenerative lumbar disease.Retrospective data were collected from 4 spine surgeons who used 3 different strategies for monitoring of pedicle screw placement in multilevel lumbar degenerative disease. A decision analysis model was developed to analyze costs and outcomes of the 3 different monitoring strategies. A total of 448 surgeries performed between 2005 and 2010 were included, with 4 cases requiring repeat operation for malpositioned screws. A sample of 64 of these patients was chosen for structured interviews in which the EuroQol-5D questionnaire was used. Expected costs and quality-adjusted life years were calculated based on the incidence of repeat operation and its negative effect on quality of life and costs.The decision analysis model demonstrated that the O-arm monitoring strategy is significantly (p < 0.001) less costly than the strategy of postoperative CT scanning following intraoperative uniplanar fluoroscopy, which in turn is significantly (p < 0.001) less costly than neurophysiological monitoring. The differences in effectiveness of the different monitoring strategies are not significant (p = 0.92).Use of the O-arm for confirming pedicle screw placement is the least costly and therefore most cost-effective strategy of the 3 techniques analyzed.",2012-01-09419,22746229,Neurosurg Focus,Matthew R Sanborn,2012,33 / 1,E12,No,22746229,"Matthew R Sanborn; Jayesh P Thawani; Robert G Whitmore; Michael Shmulevich; Benjamin Hardy; Conrad Benedetto; Neil R Malhotra; Paul Marcotte; William C Welch; Stephen Dante; Sherman C Stein; Cost-effectiveness of confirmatory techniques for the placement of lumbar pedicle screws, Neurosurg Focus, ; 33(1):1092-0684; E12",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intraoperative image guidance vs. Postoperative CT scanning (no monitoring),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-264856.25,United States,2010,-314358.29

10004,Pharmacoeconomic analysis of paliperidone palmitate for treating schizophrenia in Greece,"Patients having chronic schizophrenia with frequent relapses and hospitalizations represent a great challenge, both clinically and financially. Risperidone long-acting injection (RIS-LAI) has been the main LAI atypical antipsychotic treatment in Greece. Paliperidone palmitate (PP-LAI) has recently been approved. It is dosed monthly, as opposed to biweekly for RIS-LAI, but such advantages have not yet been analysed in terms of economic evaluation.To compare costs and outcomes of PP-LAI versus RIS-LAI in Greece.A cost-utility analysis was performed using a previously validated decision tree to model clinical pathways and costs over 1?year for stable patients started on either medication. Rates were taken from the literature. A local expert panel provided feedback on treatment patterns. All direct costs incurred by the national healthcare system were obtained from the literature and standard price lists; all were inflated to 2011 costs. Patient outcomes analyzed included average days with stable disease, numbers of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).The total annual healthcare cost with PP-LAI was ?3529; patients experienced 325?days in remission and 0.840 QALY; 28% were hospitalized and 15% received emergency room treatment. With RIS-LAI, the cost was ?3695, patients experienced 318.6?days in remission and 0.815 QALY; 33% were hospitalized and 17% received emergency room treatment. Thus, PP-LAI dominated RIS-LAI. Results were generally robust in sensitivity analyses with PP-LAI dominating in 74.6% of simulations. Results were sensitive to the price of PP-LAI.PP-LAI appears to be a cost-effective option for treating chronic schizophrenia in Greece compared with RIS-LAI since it results in savings to the health care system along with better patient outcomes.",2012-01-09423,22747533,Ann Gen Psychiatry,Thomas R Einarson,2012,11 / 1,18,No,22747533,"Thomas R Einarson; Maria Geitona; Alexandros Chaidemenos; Vasiliki Karpouza; Theodoros Mougiakos; Periklis Paterakis; Dimitrios Ploumpidis; Dionyssios Potamitis-Komis; Roman Zilbershtein; Colin Vicente; Charles Piwko; Panagiotis Kakkavas; Konstantina Paparouni; Rasmus C D Jensen; Michiel E H Hemels; Pharmacoeconomic analysis of paliperidone palmitate for treating schizophrenia in Greece, Ann Gen Psychiatry, ; 11(1):1744-859X; 18",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Paliperidone (long-lasting injection) (PP-LAI) vs. Risperidone (long-lasting injection) (RIS-LAI),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-6640,Euro,2011,-10631.48
10005,Cost-effectiveness of pertussis booster vaccination in the Netherlands,"The aim of the current study is to estimate the epidemiological and economical consequences of several extended pertussis booster vaccination strategies and to explore the impact of parameters surrounded by large uncertainty on the cost-effectiveness. We developed an age structured transmission dynamic model to evaluate the impact of programs targeting (i) adolescents or adults using a single booster dose, (ii) a combination of adolescent and adult vaccination, and (iii) an every 10 years booster dose. The base case analysis, that is a single adolescent booster administered at the age of 12 years, resulted in a reduction of pertussis infections. However, due to an increase in the number of symptomatic infections in adults, the benefits in terms of QALYs gained and costs saved in children were partly offset. Despite these negative indirect effects in the adult population, administering an additional booster dose could still be considered cost effective with an ICER of ?4200 per QALY gained. Combining an adolescent booster dose at the age of 10 (most cost-effective age for a single adolescent booster dose) with an adult (18-30 years) booster dose always resulted in favorable ICERs (<?10,000/QALY). Finally the every 10 year booster dose resulted in an ICER of ?16,900 per QALY. The impact of different assumptions regarding the disease epidemiology, disease-related parameters, and vaccination program-related issues was limited.

10008,The potential economic value of screening hospital admissions for Clostridium difficile,"Asymptomatic Clostridium difficile carriage has a prevalence reported as high as 51-85?%; with up to 84?% of incident hospital-acquired infections linked to carriers. Accurately identifying carriers may limit the spread of Clostridium difficile. Since new technology adoption depends heavily on its economic value, we developed an analytic simulation model to determine the cost-effectiveness screening hospital admissions for Clostridium difficile from the hospital and third party payer perspectives. Isolation precautions were applied to patients testing positive, preventing transmission. Sensitivity analyses varied Clostridium difficile colonization rate, infection probability among secondary cases, contact isolation compliance, and screening cost. Screening was cost-effective (i.e., incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] =?$50,000/QALY) for every scenario tested; all ICER values were?=?$256/QALY. Screening was economically dominant (i.e., saved costs and provided health benefits) with a =10.3?% colonization rate and =5.88?% infection probability when contact isolation compliance was =25?% (hospital perspective). Under some conditions screening led to cost savings per case averted (range, $53-272). Clostridium difficile screening, coupled with isolation precautions, may be a cost-effective intervention to hospitals and third party payers, based on prevalence. Limiting Clostridium difficile transmission can reduce the number of infections, thereby reducing its economic burden to the healthcare system.",2012-01-09436,22752150,Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,S M Bartsch,2012,31 / 11,3163-71,No,22752150,"S M Bartsch; S R Curry; L H Harrison; B Y Lee; The potential economic value of screening hospital admissions for Clostridium difficile, Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis, ; 31(11):0934-9723; 3163-71",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Clostridium difficile screening vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2011,Not Stated
10009,Applying economic evaluation to public health interventions: the case of interventions to promote physical activity,"BACKGROUND: This paper explores the application of alternative approaches to economic evaluation of public health interventions, using a worked example of exercise referral schemes (ERSs). METHODS: Cost-utility (CUA) and cost-consequence analyses (CCA) were used to assess the cost-effectiveness of ERSs. For the CUA, evidence was synthesized using a decision analytic model that adopts a lifetime horizon and NHS/Personal Social Services perspective. Outcomes were expressed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). CCA was conducted from a partial-societal perspective, including health and non-healthcare costs and benefits. Outcomes were reported in natural units, such as cases of strokes or CHD avoided. RESULTS: Compared with usual care, the incremental cost per QALY of ERS is pound20 876. Based on a cohort of 100 000 individuals, CCA estimates cost of ERS at pound22 million to the healthcare provider and pound12 million to participants. The benefits of ERS include additional 3900 people becoming physically active, 51 cases of CHD avoided, 16 cases of stroke avoided, 86 cases of diabetes avoided and a gain of approximately 800 QALYs. CONCLUSIONS: CCA might provide greater transparency than CUA in reporting the outcomes of public health interventions and have greater resonance with stakeholders involved in commissioning these interventions.",2012-01-09438,22753453,J Public Health (Oxf),Paul Trueman,2013,35 / 1,,No,22753453,"Paul Trueman; Nana Kwame Anokye; Applying economic evaluation to public health interventions: the case of interventions to promote physical activity, J Public Health (Oxf), 2013 Mar; 35(1):1741-3842",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Leisure center-based exercise referral schemes (ERSs) vs. Usual care,Not Stated,60 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,20876,United Kingdom,2010,38251.55
10010,Economic evaluation of strategies to reduce sudden cardiac death in young athletes,"There is controversy about appropriate methods to reduce sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes, but there is limited evidence on costs or consequences of alternative strategies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of adding electrocardiogram (ECG) screening to the currently standard practice of preparticipation history and physical examination (H&P) to reduce SCD.Decision analysis modeling by using a societal perspective, with annual Markov cycles from age 14 until death. Three screening strategies were evaluated: (1) H&P, with cardiology referral if abnormal (current standard practice); (2) H&P, plus ECG after negative H&P, and cardiology referral if either is abnormal; and (3) ECG only, with cardiology referral if abnormal. Children identified with SCD-associated cardiac abnormalities were restricted from sports and received cardiac treatment. Main outcome measures were costs of screening and treatment, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and premature deaths averted.Relative to strategy 1, incremental cost-effectiveness is $68800/QALY for strategy 2 and $37700/QALY for strategy 3. Monte Carlo simulation revealed the chance of incremental cost-effectiveness compared with strategy 1 was 30% for strategy 2 and 66% for strategy 3 (assumed willingness to pay =$50000/QALY).

10018,Cost-effectiveness of an exercise program during pregnancy to prevent gestational diabetes: Results of an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial,"ABSTRACT:The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is increasing worldwide. GDM and the risks associated with GDM lead to increased health care costs and losses in productivity. The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the FitFor2 exercise program during pregnancy is cost-effective from a societal perspective as compared to standard care.A randomised controlled trial (RCT) and simultaneous economic evaluation of the FitFor2 program were conducted. Pregnant women at risk for GDM were randomised to an exercise program to prevent high maternal blood glucose (n?=?62) or to standard care (n?=?59). The exercise program consisted of two sessions of aerobic and strengthening exercises per week. Clinical outcome measures were maternal fasting blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity and infant birth weight. Quality of life was measured using the EuroQol 5-D and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated. Resource utilization and sick leave data were collected by questionnaires. Data were analysed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Missing data were imputed using multiple imputations. Bootstrapping techniques estimated the uncertainty surrounding the cost differences and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.There were no statistically significant differences in any outcome measure. During pregnancy, total health care costs and costs of productivity losses were statistically non-significant (mean difference ?1308; 95%CI ?-229 - ?3204). The cost-effectiveness analyses showed that the exercise program was not cost-effective in comparison to the control group for blood glucose levels, insulin sensitivity, infant birth weight or QALYs.The twice-weekly exercise program for pregnant women at risk for GDM evaluated in the present study was not cost-effective compared to standard care. Based on these results, implementation of this exercise program for the prevention of GDM cannot be recommended.NTR1139.",2012-01-09445,22762376,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,Nicolette Oostdam,2012,12 /,64,No,22762376,"Nicolette Oostdam; Judith Bosmans; Maurice G A J Wouters; Elisabeth M W Eekhoff; Willem van Mechelen; Mireille N M van Poppel; Cost-effectiveness of an exercise program during pregnancy to prevent gestational diabetes: Results of an economic evaluation alongside a randomised controlled trial, BMC Pregnancy Childbirth, ; 12():1471-2393; 64",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exercise program consisting of two sessions of aerobic and strengthening exercises per week vs. Usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-197200,Euro,2009,-331519.53

However, the potential cost savings of this management strategy have not been well studied in a North American context. This study aimed to estimate the cost effectiveness of early laparoscopic cholecystectomy versus delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Canada. METHODS: A decision analytic model estimating and comparing costs from a Canadian providing institution after either early or delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy was used. The health care resources consumed were calculated using local hospital data, and outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained during 1 year. Uncertainty was investigated with one-way sensitivity analyses, varying the probabilities of the events and utilities. RESULTS: Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy was estimated to cost approximately $2,000 (Canadian dollars) less than delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy per patient, with an incremental gain of approximately 0.03 QALYs. Sensitivity analysis showed that only extreme values of bile duct injury or bile leak altered the direction of incremental gain.

The majority of these analyses are based on chemoprevention starting in men aged 50-55 years. We sought to evaluate the impact of varying both age at commencement of therapy and length of therapy on the cost-effectiveness of finasteride.Methods:A probabilistic Markov model was designed to estimate lifetime prostate health-related costs and quality-adjusted survival for men receiving or not receiving chemoprevention with finasteride. ICERs across scenarios varying age at start of therapy and duration of chemoprevention were compared.Results:The ICER for men starting chemoprevention at age 50 and continuing to age 75 was $88?800 per QALY when assuming finasteride causes a constant risk reduction across all tumor grades (base case 1) and $142?300 per QALY when assuming a differential treatment effect according to Gleason score (base case 2).

We aimed to determine the most cost-effective LTBI screening strategy before long-term steroid therapy in a child with new-onset idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. STUDY DESIGN: Markov state-transition model. SETTING & POPULATION: 5-year-old boy with new-onset idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, & TIMEFRAME: The Markov model took a societal perspective over a lifetime horizon. INTERVENTION: 3 strategies were compared: universal tuberculin skin testing (TST), targeted screening using a risk-factor questionnaire, and no screening. A secondary model included the newer interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs), requiring only one visit and having greater specificity than TST. OUTCOMES: Marginal cost-effectiveness ratios (2010 US dollars) with effectiveness measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: At an LTBI prevalence of 1.1% (the average US childhood prevalence in our base case), a no-screening strategy dominated ($2,201; 29.3356 QALYs) targeted screening ($2,218; 29.3356 QALYs) and universal TST ($2,481; 29.3347 QALYs). At a prevalence >10.3%, targeted screening with a risk-factor questionnaire was the most cost-effective option. Higher than a prevalence of 58.5%, universal TST was preferred. In the secondary model, targeted screening with a questionnaire followed by IGRA testing was cost-effective compared with no screening in the base case when the LTBI prevalence was >4.9%. LIMITATIONS: There is no established gold standard for the diagnosis of LTBI. Results of any modeling task are limited by the accuracy of available data. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to starting steroid therapy, only patients in areas with a high prevalence of LTBI will benefit from universal TST.

10044,Real-life costs and effects of an implementation program to increase thrombolysis in stroke,"We have shown that a Breakthrough Series-based implementation program increases the number of patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with alteplase 4.5% in real-life settings. It is unclear whether such an implementation program is cost-effective.The practice study includes 12 randomized hospitals and 5,515 patients. Its present cost-effectiveness analysis involves 1,657 patients with ischemic stroke admitted within 4 hours from onset. Defined primary outcomes are thrombolysis rate and actual health care costs up to 3 months, including additional implementation efforts. Secondary outcomes are lifetime quality-adjusted years (QALYs) and lifetime costs of individual trial patients, using a validated probabilistic, disability-stratified stroke life table. Differences in outcome include 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for intracluster correlation.The thrombolysis rate in the intervention group was 44.3% vs 39.8% in the control group (difference 4.5%; 95% CI 3.1% to 5.9%. Mean costs per patient at 3 months (euros were converted to 2010 USD) were $9,192 USD in the intervention group and $9,647 USD in the control group (difference -$455 USD; 95% CI -$232 to -$679 USD). Lifetime QALYs in the intervention group were 3.89 and in the control group 3.84 (difference 0.05; 95% CI -0.04 to 0.14). The mean lifetime costs in the intervention group were $22,994 USD against $24,315 USD in the control group (difference -$1,321 USD; 95% CI -$1,722 to -$921 USD).A Breakthrough Series implementation program of thrombolysis increases thrombolysis.

10045,Cost effectiveness of guanfacine extended release as an adjunctive therapy to a stimulant compared with stimulant monotherapy for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents,"Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder in childhood, affecting 3-7% of school-age children in the US and imposing substantial economic burden. Stimulants are considered first-line pharmacological treatment and are the most prescribed treatment for ADHD. However, approximately 30% of children with ADHD do not have an optimal response to a single stimulant and may require adjunctive therapy.Our objective was to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of adding a non-stimulant, guanfacine extended release (GXR), to stimulants versus maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents with suboptimal response to stimulant monotherapy.A 1-year Markov model was developed to estimate costs and effectiveness from a US third-party payer perspective. Effectiveness was measured by the QALY. The model assumed that patients transitioned among four health states (normal, mild, moderate and severe), defined by the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S) scale. Transition probabilities were estimated in an ordered logit model using patient-level data from a multicentre, 9-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization study, where subjects (n?=?461) continued their stable morning stimulant and were randomized to GXR administered in the morning, GXR administered in the evening, or placebo. The model assumed that patients in moderate/severe health states after week 8 would discontinue ADHD treatment and remain in that state for the rest of the study period. Direct costs included drug wholesale acquisition costs and health state costs, all in $US, year 2010 values. Utility associated with each health state was obtained from the literature and disutilities associated with adverse events were applied for the first 4 weeks. One-way sensitivity analyses and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted by varying costs, utilities, adverse-event duration, and transition probabilities.Compared with maintaining existing stimulant monotherapy, adding GXR to existing stimulant monotherapy was associated with an incremental drug cost of $US1016 but a lower medical cost of $US124, resulting in a total incremental cost of $US892 at 1 year. The addition of GXR to stimulants led to an incremental QALY of 0.03 and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $US31,660/QALY. In one-way sensitivity analysis, ICER values ranged from $US19,723, when 100% of patients were assumed to be severe in their initial health state, to $US46,631, when the last observed states from the clinical trial were carried forward to the end of the 1-year analysis period. PSA demonstrated a 94.6% likelihood that the ICER falls below $US50,000/QALY.The impairment associated with residual ADHD symptoms after stimulant therapy is becoming increasingly recognized. This is the first analysis of the cost effectiveness of stimulants combined with an adjunctive medication. This study suggests that the adjunctive therapy of GXR with stimulants is a cost-effective treatment based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $US50,000/QALY.

10055,Long-term cost-utility analysis of exenatide once weekly versus insulin glargine for the treatment of type 2 diabetes patients in the US,"Abstract Objective: The purpose of this study was to estimate the long-term cost-utility of treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients with exenatide once weekly (EQW) compared with insulin glargine (IG) from a US payer perspective. Methods: A validated computer simulation model, the CORE Diabetes Model, was used to project lifetime clinical outcomes and direct medical costs. Direct medical costs included pharmacy costs and costs associated with the management of diabetes and its complications. The model was populated using patient characteristics (mean age: 57.9 years; mean diabetes duration: 7.9 years; mean HbA1(c): 8.3%; mean body mass index [BMI]: 32.3?kg/m(2)) and clinical data from a phase 3 clinical trial that compared EQW with IG in T2DM patients on a background of metformin alone or a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea (DURATION-3). All EQW patients were assumed to have stayed on treatment for 3 years before switching to IG. Health outcomes and costs were discounted at 3% per year. Complication costs were derived from published sources. A range of sensitivity analyses was performed. Results: Over a lifetime horizon, and compared with IG, EQW was associated with an incremental cost of $3914 (SD?=?2923). EQW was projected to increase life expectancy by 0.135 (SD?=?0.216) years and to improve quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.246 (SD?=?0.147) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), generating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $15,936/QALY. Assuming a payer's willingness to pay threshold of $50,000/QALY, EQW is therefore cost-effective compared to IG. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed EQW's cost-effective profile. Limitations: Short-term changes (26 weeks) in surrogate end-points (e.g., HbA1(c,) weight, complications) from one clinical trial were used to project long-term future effects on clinical outcomes.

The secondary analysis estimated the cost-effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (transfemoral or transapical approaches) (SAPIEN heart valve) compared with surgical aortic valve replacement in operable patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis. METHODS: A combined decision tree and Markov model was developed to compare costs, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years over a 20-year time horizon from the Canadian health-care payer perspective. The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves trial provided rates of postoperative complications and mortality. Costs were derived from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative. Comprehensive sensitivity analyses were used to explore the impact of uncertainty on the cost-effective estimates. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, comparing transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation and standard management resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $36,458/life-year and $51,324/quality-adjusted life-year. In the secondary analysis, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (transfemoral or transapical) and surgical aortic valve replacement were compared, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $870,143/life-year and transcatheter aortic valve implantation being dominated by surgical aortic valve replacement when comparing quality-adjusted life-years. Deterministic sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis identified the procedural costs and 1-year mortality rates of both transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation and standard management to be the most sensitive parameters in the model, whereas results from the secondary analysis were largely unchanged. Removal of long-term complications in both analyses led to more favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

10058,Cost-effectiveness of a community-based physical activity programme for adults (Be Active) in the UK: an economic analysis within a natural experiment,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of a physical activity programme (Be Active) aimed at city-dwelling adults living in Birmingham, UK. METHODS: Very little is known about the cost-effectiveness of public health programmes to improve city-wide physical activity rates. This paper presents a cost-effectiveness analysis that compares a physical activity intervention (Be Active) with no intervention (usual care) using an economic model to quantify the reduction in disease risk over a lifetime. Metabolic equivalent minutes achieved per week, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and healthcare costs were all included as the main outcome measures in the model. A cost-benefit analysis was also conducted using ''willingness-to-pay'' as a measure of value. RESULTS: Under base-case assumptions-that is, assuming that the benefits of increased physical activity are sustained over 5 years, participation in the Be Active programme increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.06 years, at an expected discounted cost of pound3552, and thus the cost-effectiveness of Be Active is pound400 per QALY. When the start-up costs of the programme are removed from the economic model, the cost-effectiveness is further improved to pound16 per QALY. The societal value placed on the Be Active programme was greater than the operation cost therefore the Be Active physical activity intervention results in a net benefit to society. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in Be Active appeared to be cost-effective and cost-beneficial. These results support the use of Be Active as part of a public health programme to improve physical activity levels within the Birmingham-wide population.",2012-01-09492,22797421,Br J Sports Med,Emma J Frew,2014,48 / 3,,No,22797421,"Emma J Frew; Mobeen Bhatti; Khine Win; Alice Sitch; Anna Lyon; Miranda Pallan; Peymane Adab; Cost-effectiveness of a community-based physical activity programme for adults (Be Active) in the UK: an economic analysis within a natural experiment, Br J Sports Med, ; 48(3):0306-3674",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Community-based physical activity intervention (Be Active)- free access to fitness gyms (including induction sessions, swimming pools and group fitness classes) vs. None",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.50,3.50,400,United Kingdom,2010,732.93
10059,A lifetime markov model for the economic evaluation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. It has serious health effects and causes substantial costs for society.The aim of the present paper was to develop a state-of-the-art decision-analytic model of COPD whereby the cost effectiveness of interventions in Germany can be estimated. To demonstrate the applicability of the model, a smoking cessation programme was evaluated against usual care.A seven-stage Markov model (disease stages I to IV according to the GOLD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease] classification, states after lung-volume reduction surgery and lung transplantation, death) was developed to conduct a cost-utility analysis from the societal perspective over a time horizon of 10, 40 and 60 years. Patients entered the cohort model at the age of 45 with mild COPD. Exacerbations were classified into three levels: mild, moderate and severe. Estimation of stage-specific probabilities (for smokers and quitters), utilities and costs was based on German data where possible. Data on effectiveness of the intervention was retrieved from the literature. A discount rate of 3% was applied to costs and effects. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to assess the robustness of the results.The smoking cessation programme was the dominant strategy compared with usual care, and the intervention resulted in an increase in health effects of 0.54 QALYs and a cost reduction of &U20AC;1115 per patient (year 2007 prices) after 60 years. In the probabilistic analysis, the intervention dominated in about 95% of the simulations. Sensitivity analyses showed that uncertainty primarily originated from data on disease progression and treatment cost in the early stages of disease.The model developed allows the long-term cost effectiveness of interventions to be estimated, and has been adapted to Germany.

10060,Health economic evaluation of insulin glargine vs NPH insulin in intensified conventional therapy for type 1 diabetes in Germany,"Abstract Objective: Basal insulin analogs are well established in the treatment of type 1 diabetes in Germany. However, little is known about their economic impact. The aim of this study for an adult population was to compare, from the perspective of the Statutory Health Insurance (SHI), the cost effectiveness of the long-acting insulin analog glargine (GLA) with intermediate-acting neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in basal bolus therapy, considering the interaction between glycemic control and the rate of hypoglycemia. Methods: A validated discrete event simulation model was adapted to the German setting to project clinical and cost outcomes over 40 years. Resources were valued with German official prices in 2009/2010 Euros. Health-related disutilities were taken from UK sources. Patient characteristics and risk factors were partially extracted from German sources in a sensitivity analysis. Results: In the base-case analysis, GLA was dominant as it increased life expectancy by 0.196 years and improved quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) by 0.396 units while at the same time leading to savings of ?5246 each per patient after 40 years compared to NPH. These results were robust in the sensitivity analyses. Monte Carlo simulation confirmed dominance of GLA in 70% (life-years gained) and 80% (QALYs gained) of the iterations. The price of GLA had the highest impact on savings. In extreme scenarios, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios increased up to ?9576 per QALY gained. Limitations of the evaluation included no myocardial re-infarction(s) and no recurrent stroke(s), patient characteristics, risk factors, and disutilities from the UK due to scarce data in Germany, and that not all diabetes-related direct costs were included, namely insulin pens and blood glucose meters. Conclusion: GLA appears to be cost effective or even cost saving among type 1 diabetics with basal bolus therapy from the perspective of SHI compared to NPH depending on the scenario chosen.",2012-01-09510,22812690,J Med Econ,Martin Pfohl,2012,15Suppl2 /,14-27,Yes,22812690,"Martin Pfohl; Peter K Sch?dlich; Franz-Werner Dippel; Katharina C Koltermann; Health economic evaluation of insulin glargine vs NPH insulin in intensified conventional therapy for type 1 diabetes in Germany, J Med Econ, ; 15Suppl2():1369-6998; 14-27",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Long-acting insulin analog glargine (GLA) in intensified conventional therapy (ICT) vs. Intermediate-acting neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insul in intensified conventional therapy (ICT),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,3.00,3.00,-13230.39,Euro,2010,-20782.16
10061,Cost-effectiveness analysis of goal-directed hemodynamic treatment of elderly hip fracture patients: before clinical research starts,"Health economic evaluations are increasingly used to make the decision to adopt new medical interventions. Before such decisions, various stakeholders have invested in clinical research. But health economic factors are seldom considered in research funding decisions. Cost-effectiveness analyses could be informative before the launch of clinical research projects, particularly when a targeted intervention is resource-intensive, total cost for the trial is very high, and expected gain of health benefits is uncertain. This study analyzed cost-effectiveness using a decision analytic model before initiating a large clinical research project on goal-directed hemodynamic treatment of elderly patients with hip fracture.A probabilistic decision analytic cost-effectiveness model was developed; the model contains a decision tree for the postoperative short-term outcome and a Markov structure for long-term outcome. Clinical effect estimates, costs, health-related quality-of-life measures, and long-term survival constituted model input that was extracted from clinical trials, national databases, and surveys. Model output consisted of estimated medical care costs related to quality-adjusted life-years.In the base case analysis, goal-directed hemodynamic treatment reduced average medical care costs by ?1,882 and gained 0.344 quality-adjusted life-years. In 96.5% of the simulations, goal-directed hemodynamic treatment is less costly and provides more quality-adjusted life-years. The results are sensitive to clinical effect size variations, although goal-directed hemodynamic treatment seems to be cost-effective even with moderate clinical effect.This study demonstrates that cost-effectiveness analysis is feasible, meaningful, and recommendable before launch of costly clinical research projects.",2012-01-09511,22814385,Anesthesiology,Erzsebet Bartha,2012,117 / 3,519-30,No,22814385,"Erzsebet Bartha; Thomas Davidson; Ami Hommel; Karl-G?ran Thorngren; Per Carlsson; Sigridur Kalman; Cost-effectiveness analysis of goal-directed hemodynamic treatment of elderly hip fracture patients: before clinical research starts, Anesthesiology, ; 117(3):0003-3022; 519-30",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Goal-directed hemodynamic treatment (GDHT) vs. Standard of care (routine fluid treatment),Not Stated,Not Stated,80 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-5470.93,Euro,2010,-8593.68

Elderly patients are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of chemotherapy, and targeted therapy might thus be a relevant alternative. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of erlotinib followed by chemotherapy after progression, compared to the reverse strategy, in fit elderly patients with advanced NSCLC participating in a prospective randomized phase 2 trial (GFPC0504).Outcomes (PFS and overall survival) and costs (limited to direct medical costs, from the third-party payer perspective) were prospectively collected until second progression. Costs after progression and health utilities (based on disease states and grade 3-4 toxicities) were derived from the literature.Median overall survival, QALY and total costs for the erlotinib-first strategy were respectively 7.1 months, 0.51 and 27 734 ?, compared to 9.4 months, 0.52 and 31 688 ? for the chemotherapy-first strategy. The Monte Carlo simulation demonstrates that the two strategies do not differ statistically.In terms of cost effectiveness, in fit elderly patients with NSCLC, erlotinib followed by chemotherapy compares well with the reverse strategy.",2012-01-09517,22817667,BMC Cancer,Christos Chouaid,2012,12 /,301,No,22817667,"Christos Chouaid; Herv?

The analysis takes into account a societal security (third-party payer) perspective.To perform the analyses of the benefits of smoking cessation in terms of smoking-related morbidity, mortality, and associated medical costs, a Markov model was used that simulated the progress of a hypothetical cohort of current smokers making a single attempt to quit smoking at the beginning of the timeframe of the analysis. The robustness of the results was assessed using a series of 1-way sensitivity analyses.Varenicline was associated with the potential prevention of 14.1, 14.2, and 35.1 additional cases of the 4 smoking-related diseases incorporated into the model, per 1000 smokers willing to quit, versus bupropion, NRT, and unaided cessation, respectively.

10079,Costs and cost-effectiveness of carotid stenting versus endarterectomy for patients at standard surgical risk: results from the Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial (CREST),"The Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy versus Stenting Trial (CREST) demonstrated similar rates of the primary composite end point between carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endarterectomy (CEA), although the risk of stroke was higher with CAS, and the risk of myocardial infarction was higher with CEA. Given the large number of patients who are candidates for these procedures, an understanding of their relative cost and cost-effectiveness may have important implications for health care policy and treatment guidelines.We performed a formal economic evaluation alongside the CREST trial. Costs were estimated from all trial participants over the first year of follow-up using a combination of resource use data and hospital billing data. Patient-level health use scores were obtained using data from the SF-36. We then used a Markov disease-simulation model calibrated to the CREST results to project 10-year costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy for the 2 treatment groups.Although initial procedural costs were $1025/patient higher with CAS, postprocedure costs and physician costs were lower such that total costs for the index hospitalization were similar for the CAS and CEA groups ($15 055 versus $14 816; mean difference, $239/patient; 95% CI for difference, -$297 to $775). Neither follow-up costs after discharge nor total 1-year costs differed significantly. For the CREST population, model-based projections over a 10-year time horizon demonstrated that CAS would result in a mean incremental cost of $524/patient and a reduction in quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.008 years compared with CEA. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that CEA was economically attractive at an incremental cost-effectiveness threshold of $50 000/quality-adjusted life-year gained in 54% of samples, whereas CAS was economically attractive in 46%.Despite slightly lower in-trial costs and lower rates of stroke with CEA compared with CAS, projected 10-year outcomes from this controlled clinical trial demonstrate only trivial differences in overall healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy between the 2 strategies. If the CREST results can be replicated in clinical practice, these findings suggest that factors other than cost-effectiveness should be considered when deciding between treatment options for carotid artery stenosis in patients at standard risk for surgical complications.

10082,Cost-effectiveness analysis of antipsychotics in reducing schizophrenia relapses,"Schizophrenia is a severe form of mental illness which is associated with significant and long-lasting health, social and financial burdens.The aim of this project is to assess the efficiency of the antipsychotics used in Spain in reducing schizophrenia relapses under the Spanish Health System perspective.A decision-analytic model was developed to explore the relative cost-effectiveness of five antipsychotic medications, amisulpride, aripiprazole, olanzapine, paliperidone Extended-Release (ER) and risperidone, compared to haloperidol, over a 1-year treatment period among people living in Spain with schizophrenia. The transition probabilities for assessed therapies were obtained from the systemic review and meta-analysis performed by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).Paliperidone ER was the option that yielded more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient (0.7573).

10087,"The societal burden of blindness secondary to retinopathy of prematurity in Lima, Peru","To determine the cost-effectiveness of laser treatment for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in Lima, Peru.A cost-of-illness study (in US dollars) to determine the direct cost of treatment, the indirect lifetime cost of blindness, and the quality-adjusted life years.The direct cost of ROP-related treatment was determined by reviewing data retrospectively from a social security sector hospital. The indirect cost was determined using national economic data of Peru published by the Central Information Agency (CIA), including the per capita gross domestic product, the sex-adjusted income distribution, and years spent in the work force. Indirect costs per child that were avoided by treatment were calculated using the known natural history of ROP vs evidence-based treatment.For ROP-related neonatal blindness in Peru, we estimate the total indirect cost saving at $197,753 per child and the direct cost of laser treatment at $2496 per child. The societal lifetime cost saving per child is estimated at $195,257. The mean annual income per educated adult in Peru is $8000 and treating 1 child is equivalent to employing 24 educated Peruvians per year. The generational cost savings for society is approximately $516 million, or the equivalent of 64,500 educated Peruvian work years.The societal burden of blindness far exceeds the costs of treatment per child. Proper screening and treatment of ROP prevents blindness and leads to substantial cost savings for society.

10088,Long-term clinical and economic outcomes associated with liraglutide versus sitagliptin therapy when added to metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a CORE Diabetes Model analysis,"Abstract Background: A recent open-label, parallel group trial showed that liraglutide is superior to sitagliptin for reduction of HbA1c, and is well tolerated with minimum risk of hypoglycemia. Although these findings support the use of liraglutide as an effective GLP-1 agent to add to metformin, the value of liraglutide needs to be quantified in the framework of a cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis in a US setting. Objective: This current study sets out to assess the long-term cost-effectiveness outcomes of liraglutide vs sitagliptin based on treatment effects data from the 1860-LIRA-DPP-4 52-week trial. Methods: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model (CDM), a non-product-specific, validated computer simulation model that projects the long-term outcomes related to interventions for type 2 diabetes, is used for simulation of these interventions. In the model, patients were treated initially on one of the three treatment options: liraglutide 1.2?mg daily, 1.8?mg daily, or sitagliptin 100?mg daily, each used as add-on therapy to metformin for 5 years. After 5 years all patients switched to basal insulin treatment for the remainder of the simulation (35-year time horizon overall). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were generated for liraglutide 1.2?mg compared with sitagliptin and liraglutide 1.8?mg compared with sitagliptin. Transition probabilities, health state utility values, and complication costs were obtained from published sources. All outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum, and the analysis was conducted from the perspective of a third-party payer in the US. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test robustness of the base case scenario. Results: For liraglutide 1.8?mg vs sitagliptin, the ICER was $37,234 per QALY gained, while for liraglutide 1.2?mg vs sitagliptin, the ICER was $25,742 per QALY gained. In all sensitivity analyses, including setting the change in HbA1c to the lower limits of the 95% confidence intervals, the ICERs remained below US$ 50,000/QALY, a commonly accepted threshold in the US, except for the shortest time horizon of 10 years.

A cost-utility analysis was performed for 4 surgical UNE treatment options. We hypothesized that simple decompression would emerge as the most cost-effective strategy.A cost-utility analysis was performed from the societal perspective. A decision analytic model was designed comparing 4 strategies: (1) simple decompression followed by a salvage surgery (anterior submuscular transposition) for a poor outcome, (2) anterior subcutaneous transposition followed by a salvage surgery for a poor outcome, (3) medial epicondylectomy followed by a salvage surgery for a poor outcome, and (4) anterior submuscular transposition. A poor outcome when anterior submuscular transposition was the initial surgery was considered an end point in the model. Preference values for temporary health states for UNE, the surgical procedures, and the complications were obtained through a time trade-off survey administered to family members and friends who accompanied patients to physician visits. Probabilities of clinical outcomes were derived from a Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis and a systematic MEDLINE and EMBASE search of the literature. Medical care costs (in 2009 U.S. dollars) were derived from Medicare reimbursement rates. The model estimated quality-adjusted life-years and costs for a 3-year time horizon.

10092,Development of a population-based cost-effectiveness model of chronic graft-versus-host disease in Spain,"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is the leading cause of late nonrelapse mortality (transplant-related mortality) after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Given that there are a wide range of treatment options for cGvHD, assessment of the associated costs and efficacy can help clinicians and health care providers allocate health care resources more efficiently.The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) compared with rituximab (Rmb) and with imatinib (Imt) in patients with cGvHD at 5 years from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System.The model assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness/utility ratio of ECP versus Rmb or Imt for 1000 hypothetical patients by using microsimulation cost-effectiveness techniques. Model probabilities were obtained from the literature. Treatment pathways and adverse events were evaluated taking clinical opinion and published reports into consideration.

10093,Development of a population-based cost-effectiveness model of chronic graft-versus-host disease in Spain,"Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) is the leading cause of late nonrelapse mortality (transplant-related mortality) after hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Given that there are a wide range of treatment options for cGvHD, assessment of the associated costs and efficacy can help clinicians and health care providers allocate health care resources more efficiently.The purpose of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) compared with rituximab (Rmb) and with imatinib (Imt) in patients with cGvHD at 5 years from the perspective of the Spanish National Health System.The model assessed the incremental cost-effectiveness/utility ratio of ECP versus Rmb or Imt for 1000 hypothetical patients by using microsimulation cost-effectiveness techniques. Model probabilities were obtained from the literature. Treatment pathways and adverse events were evaluated taking clinical opinion and published reports into consideration. Local data on costs (2010 Euros) and health care resources utilization were validated by the clinical authors. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess the robustness of the model.The greater efficacy of ECP resulted in a gain of 0.011 to 0.024 quality-adjusted life-year in the first year and 0.062 to 0.094 at year 5 compared with Rmb or Imt.

10094,Extending contraceptive coverage under the Affordable Care Act saves public funds,"BACKGROUND: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) will expand health care coverage to low-income Americans. Contraception services are a mandated component of ACA plans. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare the costs and outcomes of the current versus the proposed plan for contraceptive coverage (Federal Poverty Level=185% vs. 399%, respectively) over 5 years. The perspective adopted was that of Oregon state insurance providers. The primary outcomes were number of pregnancies averted, health costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Contraceptive failure rates, costs, projected insurance coverage, contraception use and pregnancy outcome data were obtained from the published literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed for all variables. RESULTS: Extending contraceptive coverage both saves money and improves outcomes for Oregon state insurance plan providers. The proposed policy would prevent an additional 72 pregnancies per 1000 women over 5 years. Extending coverage is cost-effective, saving an additional $489 per woman enrolled over 5 years while increasing QALYs.

All probabilities, costs, and benefits were derived from the literature. Base case, sensitivity analyses, and a Monte Carlo simulation were performed.Screening with the 2h OGTT was more expensive, more effective, and cost effective at $61,503/quality-adjusted life year. In a 1-way sensitivity analysis, the more inclusive IADPSG diagnostic approach remained cost effective as long as an additional 2.0% or more of patients were diagnosed and treated for gestational diabetes mellitus.Screening at 24-28 weeks' gestational age under the new IADPSG guidelines with the 2h OGTT is expensive but cost effective in improving maternal and neonatal outcomes.

10096,Cost-effectiveness of optimizing prevention in patients with coronary heart disease: the EUROASPIRE III health economics project,"Aims The EUROASPIRE III survey indicated that the guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention are poorly implemented in patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD). The purpose of this health economic project was to assess the potential clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of optimizing cardiovascular prevention in eight EUROASPIRE III countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, France, Italy, Poland, and the UK). Methods and results The individual risk for subsequent cardiovascular events was estimated, based on published Framingham equations. Based on the EUROASPIRE III data, the type of suboptimal prevention, if any, was identified for each individual, and the effects of optimized tailored prevention (smoking cessation, diet and exercise, better management of elevated blood pressure and/or LDL-cholesterol) were estimated. Costs of prevention and savings of avoided events were based on country-specific data. A willingness to pay threshold of ?30 000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) was used. The robustness of the results was validated by sensitivity analyses. Overall, the cost-effectiveness analyses for the eight countries showed mainly favourable results with an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ?12 484 per QALY. Only in the minority of patients at the lowest risk for recurrent events, intensifying preventive therapy seems not cost-effective. Also, the single impact of intensified cholesterol control seems less cost-effective, possibly because their initial 2-year risk was already fairly low, hence the room for improvement is rather limited. Conclusion These results underscore the societal value of optimizing prevention in most patients with established CHD, but also highlight the need for setting priorities towards patients more at risk and the need for more studies comparing intensified prevention with usual care in these patients.",2012-01-09556,22843446,Eur Heart J,Delphine De Smedt,2012,33 / 22,2865-72,No,22843446,"Delphine De Smedt; Kornelia Kotseva; Dirk De Bacquer; David Wood; Guy De Backer; Jean Dallongeville; Lehto Seppo; Andrzej Pajak; Zeljko Reiner; Diego Vanuzzo; Borislav Georgiev; Nina Gotcheva; Lieven Annemans; Cost-effectiveness of optimizing prevention in patients with coronary heart disease: the EUROASPIRE III health economics project, Eur Heart J, ; 33(22):0195-668X; 2865-72",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Optimized tailored prevention for every individual (smoking cessation, diet and exercise, better management of elevated blood pressure and/or LDL-cholesterol) vs. Usual care",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,12484,Euro,2010,19609.74
