17601,An initial cost-effectiveness analysis of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) in pediatric epilepsy surgery,"PURPOSE: Previous studies have illustrated the clinical utility of the addition of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) to conventional microsurgical resection. While iMRI requires initial capital cost investment, long-term reduction in costly follow-up management and reoperation costs may prove economically efficacious. The objective of this study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the addition of iMRI utilization versus conventional microsurgical techniques in focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) resection in pediatric patients with medically refractory epilepsy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of pediatric subjects who underwent surgical resection of FCD at the Children''s National Health System between March 2005 and April 2015. Patients were assigned to one of three cohorts: iMRI-assisted resection, conventional resection with iMRI-assisted reoperation, or conventional resection. Direct costs included preoperative, operative, postoperative, long-term follow-up, and antiepileptic drug (AED) costs. The cost-effectiveness was calculated as the sum total of all direct medical costs over the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). We also performed sensitivity analysis on numerous variables to assess the validity of our results. RESULTS: Fifty-six consecutive pediatric patients underwent resective surgery for medically intractable FCD. Ten patients underwent iMRI-assisted resection; 7 underwent conventional resection followed by iMRI-assisted reoperation; 39 patients underwent conventional microsurgical resection. Taken over the lifetime of the patient, the cumulative discounted QALY of patients in the iMRI-assisted resection cohort was about 2.91 years, versus 2.61 years in the conventional resection with iMRI-assisted reoperation cohort, and 1.76 years for the conventional resection cohort. Adjusting for inflation, iMRI-assisted surgeries have a cost-effectiveness ratio of $16,179 per QALY, versus $28,514 per QALY for the conventional resection with iMRI-assisted reoperation cohort, and $49,960 per QALY for the conventional resection cohort. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that no one single variable significantly altered cost-effectiveness across all three cohorts compared to the baseline results. CONCLUSION: The addition of iMRI to conventional microsurgical techniques for resection of FCD in pediatric patients with intractable epilepsy resulted in increased seizure freedom and reduction in long-term direct medical costs compared to conventional surgeries. Our data suggests that iMRI may be a cost-effective addition to the surgical armamentarium for epilepsy surgery.",2017-01-24172,29159426,Childs Nerv Syst,Matthew F Sacino,2017,/,,No,29159426,"Matthew F Sacino; Sean S Huang; Robert F Keating; William D Gaillard; Chima O Oluigbo; An initial cost-effectiveness analysis of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) in pediatric epilepsy surgery, Childs Nerv Syst, 2017 Nov 20; ():1433-0350",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Initial conventional microsurgical resection followed by iMRI-assisted reoperation vs. None,pediatric patients presenting for surgery for medically intractable epilepsy secondary to FCD,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,28514,United States,2016,30748.01

17603,Cost-Effectiveness of Publicly Funded Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder in California,"Background: Only 1 in 5 of the nearly 2.4 million Americans with an opioid use disorder received treatment in 2015. Fewer than half of Californians who received treatment in 2014 received opioid agonist treatment (OAT), and regulations for admission to OAT in California are more stringent than federal regulations. Objective: To determine the cost-effectiveness of OAT for all treatment recipients compared with the observed standard of care for patients presenting with opioid use disorder to California''s publicly funded treatment facilities. Design: Model-based cost-effectiveness analysis. Data Sources: Linked population-level administrative databases capturing treatment and criminal justice records for California (2006 to 2010); published literature. Target Population: Persons initially presenting for publicly funded treatment of opioid use disorder. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: Societal. Intervention: Immediate access to OAT with methadone for all treatment recipients compared with the observed standard of care (54.3% initiate opioid use disorder treatment with medically managed withdrawal). Outcome Measures: Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and discounted costs. Results of Base-Case Analysis: Immediate access to OAT for all treatment recipients costs less (by $78 257), with patients accumulating more QALYs (by 0.42) than with the observed standard of care. In a hypothetical scenario where all Californians starting treatment of opioid use disorder in 2014 had immediate access to OAT, total lifetime savings for this cohort could be as high as $3.8 billion. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: 99.6% of the 2000 simulations resulted in lower costs and more QALYs. Limitation: Nonrandomized delivery of OAT or medically managed withdrawal.

17605,Cost-Effectiveness of Endoscopic Versus Microscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery for Pituitary Adenoma,"Background: Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery (ETPS) has become increasingly popular for resection of pituitary tumors, whereas microscopic transsphenoidal surgery (MTPS) also remains a commonly used approach. The economic sustainability of new techniques and technologies is rarely evaluated in the neurosurgical skull base literature. The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of ETPS compared with MTPS. Methods: A Markov model was constructed to conduct a cost-utility analysis of ETPS versus MTPS from a single-payer health care perspective. Data were obtained from previously published outcomes studies. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates, considering covariates such as complications, length of stay, and operative time. The base case adopted a 2-year follow-up period. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: On average, ETPS costs $143 less and generates 0.014 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with MTPS over 2 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is -$10,214 per QALY, suggesting economic dominance. The QALY benefit increased to 0.105 when modeled to 10 years, suggesting that ETPS becomes even more favorable over time. Conclusions: ETPS appears to be cost-effective when compared with MTPS because the ICER falls below the commonly accepted $50,000 per QALY benchmark. Model limitations and assumptions affect the generalizability of the conclusion; however, ongoing efforts to improve rhinologic morbidity related to ETPS would appear to further augment the marginal cost savings and QALYs gained. Further research on the cost-effectiveness of ETPS using prospective data is warranted.",2017-01-24176,29158096,World Neurosurg,Jared D Ament,2017,/,,No,29158096,"Jared D Ament; Zhuo Yang; Vic Khatchadourian; Edward B Strong; Kiarash Shahlaie; Cost-Effectiveness of Endoscopic Versus Microscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery for Pituitary Adenoma, World Neurosurg , 2017 Mar 30; ():1878-8750",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery vs. Microscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery,45 year old patient with pituitary pathology that had a planned primary or secondary transsphenoidal surgery in the outpatient neurosurgical setting,45 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-10214.3,United States,2014,-11166.76
17606,Cost-utility of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk,"AIMS: In the Empagliflozin, Cardiovascular Outcomes, and Mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (EMPA-REG) trial, empagliflozin reduced cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients at high cardiovascular risk. We sought to estimate the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin versus standard treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with T2D. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin (versus standard treatment) for the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with T2D using a 3-month cycle length and a lifetime horizon. Data sources included the EMPA-REG randomized clinical trial and other published epidemiological studies. Outcomes included treatment costs (in 2016 US$), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was performed to test the robustness of conclusions. RESULTS: Empagliflozin use resulted in higher total lifetime treatment costs ($371,450 versus $272,966) but yielded greater QALYs (10.712 vs. 9.419) compared to standard treatment. This corresponded to an ICER of $76,167 per QALY gained. PSA suggested empagliflozin would be cost-effective in 96% of 10,000 iterations assuming a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per QALY gained.

17607,Cost effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with aortic stenosis in Japan,"BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a less invasive treatment for elderly patients with aortic stenosis. However, the cost of TAVI is a major issue. This study analyzed the cost effectiveness of TAVI in Japan. METHODS: We developed an economic model to evaluate the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs of TAVI, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), and medical therapy over a 10-year time horizon from the perspective of Japanese public healthcare payers. The first model compared transapical or transfemoral TAVI with Sapien valve implantation and medical therapy in inoperable patients. The second model compared transfemoral TAVI with Sapien XT valve implantation and SAVR in operable patients with intermediate surgical risk. We assumed a cost-effectiveness threshold of 5,000,000yen per QALY, and assessed the cost-effectiveness probability with 100,000 simulations. We performed a broad sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of uncertainty on our results. RESULTS: Among inoperable patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for TAVI compared with medical therapy was 3,918,808yen per QALY. In operable patients, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for TAVI compared with SAVR was 7,523,821yen per QALY. The cost-effectiveness probability of TAVI was 60% for inoperable patients and 46% for operable patients. Among inoperable patients, the cost-effective threshold of TAVI was <7,759,085yen.

17609,Cost Effectiveness of a Shingles Vaccine Booster for Currently Vaccinated Adults in the U.S,"INTRODUCTION: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends a single dose of the live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine in people aged >/=60 years. Because vaccine-induced protection decreases to zero after 10 years, many vaccinated people will soon be subject to an increased risk of the disease. The study objective was to determine the cost effectiveness of a herpes zoster vaccine booster and its optimal timing among immunocompetent adults first vaccinated at aged >/=60 years. METHODS: A Markov model was built to follow vaccinated individuals for a lifetime. From the societal perspective, costs and quality-adjusted life years were compared between no booster versus booster options. A booster was given any time between 1 and 20 years after the first dose, and for those who had the first dose at different ages: 60, 70, and 80 years. Because people entered the model already vaccinated, costs and side effects of the first dose were not included. The booster was assumed to have the same efficacy and waning rate as the initial vaccination. Model inputs were based on published literature. A cost effectiveness threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life year was used. The analysis was conducted in 2016. RESULTS: Cost effectiveness of a booster varied by age and time since vaccination. The booster cost <$100,000/quality-adjusted life year if given >5 years after the initial dose, but was most cost effective at around 10 years.

17612,Age-specific Cost Effectiveness of Using Intravenous Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Treating Acute Ischemic Stroke,"INTRODUCTION: Studies have demonstrated that intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) is a cost-effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Age-specific cost effectiveness has not been well examined. This study estimated age-specific incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of IV rtPA treatment versus no IV rtPA. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to examine the economic impact of IV rtPA over a 20-year time horizon on four age groups (18-44, 45-64, 65-80, and >/=81 years) from the U.S. healthcare sector perspective. The model used health outcomes from a national stroke registry adjusted by parameters from previous literature and current hospitalization costs in 2013 U.S. dollars. Long-term annual costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the years after a stroke were discounted at 3% per year. Incremental costs, incremental QALYs, and ICERs were estimated and sensitivity analyses were conducted between 2015 and 2017. RESULTS: Use of IV rtPA gained 0.55 QALYs and cost $3,941 more than no IV rtPA for stroke patients aged >/=18 years over a 20-year time horizon. IV rtPA was a dominant strategy compared to no IV rtPA for patients aged 18-44 and 45-64 years.

17613,Age-specific Cost Effectiveness of Using Intravenous Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Treating Acute Ischemic Stroke,"INTRODUCTION: Studies have demonstrated that intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) is a cost-effective treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Age-specific cost effectiveness has not been well examined. This study estimated age-specific incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of IV rtPA treatment versus no IV rtPA. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to examine the economic impact of IV rtPA over a 20-year time horizon on four age groups (18-44, 45-64, 65-80, and >/=81 years) from the U.S. healthcare sector perspective. The model used health outcomes from a national stroke registry adjusted by parameters from previous literature and current hospitalization costs in 2013 U.S. dollars. Long-term annual costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in the years after a stroke were discounted at 3% per year. Incremental costs, incremental QALYs, and ICERs were estimated and sensitivity analyses were conducted between 2015 and 2017. RESULTS: Use of IV rtPA gained 0.55 QALYs and cost $3,941 more than no IV rtPA for stroke patients aged >/=18 years over a 20-year time horizon.

17617,Lifetime cost-effectiveness analysis of intraoperative radiation therapy versus external beam radiation therapy for early stage breast cancer,"Background: To date no one has examined the quality of life and direct costs of care in treating early stage breast cancer with adjunct intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) versus external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) over the life of the patient. As well no one has examined the effects of radiation exposure with both therapies on the longer term sequelae. The purpose of this analysis was to examine the cost-effectiveness of IORT vs. EBRT over the life of the patient. Methods: A Markov decision-analytic model evaluated these treatment strategies in terms of the direct costs in treating patients over their lifetime (including the downstream costs associated with radiation exposure) and the resultant quality of life of these patients. Medicare reimbursement amounts in treating patients were used for acute, steady state, recurrent cancer(s), and complications associated with radiation exposure. Quality adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the medical literature were assessed with each of these states. Life expectancies as well were derived from the medical literature. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated for dominance and net monetary benefit [at a willingness to pay (WTP)] of $50,000/QALY. Sensitivity analysis was also performed. Results: IORT was the dominant (least costly with greater QALYs) versus EBRT: total costs over the life of the patient = $53,179 (IORT) vs. $63,828 (EBRT) and total QALYs: 17.86 (IORT) vs. 17.06 (EBRT). At a willingness to pay of $50,000 for each additional QALY, the net monetary benefit demonstrated that IORT was the most cost effective option: $839,815 vs. $789,092. The model was most sensitive to the probabilities of recurrent cancer and death for both IORT and EBRT.

17619,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of S-1 therapy for first-line metastatic breast cancer treatment in Japan: results from the randomized phase III SELECT BC trial,"BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of replacing standard intravenous therapy (taxane) with oral S-1 therapy for first-line metastatic breast cancer treatment. METHODS: This cost-effectiveness analysis was based on data from a randomized phase III trial (SELECT BC). As cost-effectiveness was a secondary endpoint of the SELECT BC trial, some of the randomized patients participated in an EQ-5D survey (N = 391) and health economic survey (N = 146). The EQ-5D responses, claims, and prescription data were collected for as long as possible until death. The expected quality-adjusted life years (QALY) obtained from each treatment were calculated using patient-level EQ-5D data, and the expected cost was calculated using patient-level claim data. The analysis was performed from the perspective of public healthcare payers. RESULTS: The estimated EQ-5D least-square means and 95% CI up to 48 months were 0.764 (95% CI, 0.741-0.782) and 0.742 (95% CI, 0.720-0.764) in the S-1 and taxane arms, respectively. The expected QALY was 2.11 for the S-1 arm and 2.04 for the taxane arm, with expected costs of JPY 5.13 million (USD 46,600) and JPY 5.56 million (USD 50,500), respectively. These results show that S-1 is cost-saving. According to probabilistic sensitivity analysis, S-1 was dominant with a probability of 63%. When the willingness to pay (WTP) value was JPY 5 million (USD 45,500) per QALY, the probability of being cost-effective was 92%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the introduction of oral S-1 therapy for metastatic breast cancer is highly likely to be cost-effective. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN CTR C000000416 .

17620,A Cost-Utility Analysis of Endovascular Aneurysm Repair for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm,"Objective: To assess medical economic adequacy of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Methods: Cost-utility analysis. A total of 21 patients with AAA treated at Ibaraki Prefectural Central Hospital in 2014 were divided into non-ruptured EVAR (Group E) and open surgery (OS) (Group O), and ruptured OS (Group R) groups, and hospital costs were aggregated with a medical accounting system. Mid-level hospital costs were estimated by a diagnosis-procedure-combination analysis system. Incremental life years were extrapolated from the results of randomized controlled trials in the UK (EVAR Trial 1 and 2), a life table, and the Pancreas Cancer Registry in Japan. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were estimated under the assumption of a certain quality weight. Results: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of EVAR compared with the OS was calculated to be 31.0 million yen/QALY, which is economically inadequate. ICER of EVAR compared with conservative treatment was inadequate in some subgroups of extremely old patients and in patients operated for far-advanced cancer. Conclusion: EVAR is inadequate with respect to medical economics as a substitute for OS for patients in whom both procedures are available. The indication for EVAR in patients ineligible for OS should be different from that for surgery in usual patients with AAA.

17629,Cost-effectiveness of gammaCore (non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation) for acute treatment of episodic cluster headache,"Cluster headache is a debilitating disease characterized by excruciatingly painful attacks that affects 0.15% to 0.4% of the US population. Episodic cluster headache manifests as circadian and circannual seasonal bouts of attacks, each lasting 15 to 180 minutes, with periods of remission. In chronic cluster headache, the attacks occur throughout the year with no periods of remission. While existing treatments are effective for some patients, many patients continue to suffer. There are only 2 FDA-approved medications for episodic cluster headache in the United States, while others, such as high-flow oxygen, are used off-label. Episodic cluster headache is associated with comorbidities and affects work, productivity, and daily functioning. The economic burden of episodic cluster headache is considerable, costing more than twice that of nonheadache patients. gammaCore adjunct to standard of care (SoC) was found to have superior efficacy in treatment of acute episodic cluster headaches compared with sham-gammaCore used with SoC in ACT1 and ACT2 trials. However, the economic impact has not been characterized for this indication. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of gammaCore adjunct to SoC compared with SoC alone for the treatment of acute pain associated with episodic cluster headache attacks. The model structure was based on treatment of acute attacks with 3 outcomes: failures, nonresponders, and responders. The time horizon of the model is 1 year using a payer perspective with uncertainty incorporated. Parameter inputs were derived from primary data from the randomized controlled trials for gammaCore. The mean annual costs associated with the gammaCore-plus-SoC arm was $9510, and mean costs for the SoC-alone arm was $10,040. The mean quality-adjusted life years for gammaCore-plus-SoC arm were 0.83, and for the SoC-alone arm, they were 0.74. The gammaCore-plus-SoC arm was dominant over SoC alone. All 1-way and multiway sensitivity analyses were cost-effective using a threshold of $20,000. gammaCore dominance, representing savings, was driven by superior efficacy, improvement in quality of life (QoL), and reduction in costs associated with successful and consistent abortion of episodic attacks. These findings serve as additional economic evidence to support coverage for gammaCore. Additional real-world data are needed to characterize the long-term impact of gammaCore on comorbidities, utilization, QoL, daily functioning, productivity, and social engagement of these patients, and for other indications.",2017-01-24215,29144720,Am J Manag Care,Mkaya Mwamburi,2017,23 / 16 Suppl,S300-S306,No,29144720,"Mkaya Mwamburi; Eric J Liebler; Andrew T Tenaglia; Cost-effectiveness of gammaCore (non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation) for acute treatment of episodic cluster headache, Am J Manag Care, 2017 Nov; 23(16 Suppl):1096-1860; S300-S306",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,GammaCore with Standard of Care vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard of Care,Adults with acute pain associated with episodic cluster headache attacks.,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,5.00,0.00,-5888.89,United States,2017,-6217.81
17630,Cost-utility analysis of life-long prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIIIFc vs recombinant factor VIII for the management of severe hemophilia A in Sweden,"AIMS: Prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) is the standard of care for severe haemophilia A in Sweden. The need for frequent injections with existing rFVIII products may, however, result in poor adherence to prophylaxis leading to increased bleeding and long-term joint damage. Recombinant FVIIIFc (rFVIIIFc) is an extended half-life fusion protein which can offer prolonged protection and reduced dosing frequency. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-utility of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc in severe haemophilia A from the perspective of the Swedish health system. METHODS: A Markov model was built to estimate life-time costs and benefits of prophylaxis with rFVIIIFc versus rFVIII products. Clinical outcomes were represented by annualised bleeding rate (ABR) and quality of life via disutility applied to bleeding events and injection frequency. Costs included the cost of FVIII for routine prophylaxis and bleed resolution. The pooled comparator was costed by weighting the cost of individual products by their market share. RESULTS: In the base case, rFVIIIFc was dominant versus the pooled comparator. Savings of SEK 9.3 million per patient resulted from lower factor consumption for prophylaxis and bleed resolution. Fewer bleeds and reduced injection frequency yielded an estimated 0.59 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results were sensitive to drug dosage and robust to variation in other parameters. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested a greater than 85% probability of rFVIIIFc being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 500,000 SEK/QALY. LIMITATIONS: Due to unavailibilty of patient-level data, treatment benefit was based on a non-adjusted indirect comparison. Dosing and treatment outcomes were assumed to persist over the model duration in the absence of long-term outcome data. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that rFVIIIFc may be a cost-effective option for haemophilia A prophylaxis, generating greater quality of life and reduced costs for the Swedish payer compared to more frequently administered rFVIII alternatives.",2017-01-24221,29139314,J Med Econ,Nathaniel Henry,2017,/,1-23,Yes,29139314,"Nathaniel Henry; Jelena Jovanovic; Max Schlueter; Persefoni Kritikou; Koo Wilson; Karl-Johan Myren; Cost-utility analysis of life-long prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIIIFc vs recombinant factor VIII for the management of severe hemophilia A in Sweden, J Med Econ, 2017 May 22; ():1369-6998; 1-23",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylaxis with Recombinant FVIII (rFVIIIFc) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Prophylaxis with recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII),Patients with severe hemophila A who are treated with rFVIIIFc are considered for this study.,Not Stated,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-15224650.85,Sweden,2015,-1971889.16
17631,Comparative clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of endovascular strategy v open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: three year results of the IMPROVE randomised trial,"Objective To assess the three year clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness of a strategy of endovascular repair (if aortic morphology is suitable, open repair if not) versus open repair for patients with suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.Design Randomised controlled trial.Setting 30 vascular centres (29 in UK, one in Canada), 2009-16.Participants 613 eligible patients (480 men) with a clinical diagnosis of ruptured aneurysm, of whom 502 underwent emergency repair for rupture.Interventions 316 patients were randomised to an endovascular strategy (275 with confirmed rupture) and 297 to open repair (261 with confirmed rupture).Main outcome measures Mortality, with reinterventions after aneurysm repair, quality of life, and hospital costs to three years as secondary measures.Results The maximum follow-up for mortality was 7.1 years, with two patients in each group lost to follow-up by three years. After similar mortality by 90 days, in the mid-term (three months to three years) there were fewer deaths in the endovascular than the open repair group (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.90), leading to lower mortality at three years (48% v 56%), but by seven years mortality was about 60% in each group (hazard ratio 0.92, 0.75 to 1.13). Results for the 502 patients with repaired ruptures were more pronounced: three year mortality was lower in the endovascular strategy group (42% v 54%; odds ratio 0.62, 0.43 to 0.88), but after seven years there was no clear difference between the groups (hazard ratio 0.86, 0.68 to 1.08). Reintervention rates up to three years were not significantly different between the randomised groups (hazard ratio 1.02, 0.79 to 1.32); the initial rapid rate of reinterventions was followed by a much slower mid-term reintervention rate in both groups. The early higher average quality of life in the endovascular strategy versus open repair group, coupled with the lower mortality at three years, led to a gain in average quality adjusted life years (QALYs) at three years of 0.17 (95% confidence interval 0.00 to 0.33). The endovascular strategy group spent fewer days in hospital and had lower average costs of - pound2605 (95% confidence interval - pound5966 to pound702) (about euro2813; $3439). The probability that the endovascular strategy is cost effective was >90% at all levels of willingness to pay for a QALY gain.Conclusions At three years, compared with open repair, an endovascular strategy for suspected ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was associated with a survival advantage, a gain in QALYs, similar levels of reintervention, and reduced costs, and this strategy was cost effective. These findings support the increasing use of an endovascular strategy, with wider availability of emergency endovascular repair.Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN48334791; ClinicalTrials NCT00746122.",2017-01-24223,29138135,BMJ,IMPROVE Trial Investigators,2017,359 /,j4859,No,29138135,"IMPROVE Trial Investigators; Comparative clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of endovascular strategy v open repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm: three year results of the IMPROVE randomised trial, BMJ, 2017 Nov 14; 359():0959-8138; j4859",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular Strategy vs. Standard/Usual Care- Open Repair,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,7 Years,3.50,3.50,-15323.53,United Kingdom,2015,-25575.76

17638,The Cost-effectiveness of Dulaglutide 1.5mg versus Exenatide QW for the Treatment of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in France,"INTRODUCTION: Dulaglutide is a novel onceweekly administered glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The objective of this analysis was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of dulaglutide 1.5 mg versus exenatide QW for the management of T2DM in France. METHODS: The QuintilesIMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to estimate the expected lifetime direct medical costs and outcomes of T2DM from the perspective of the French National Health Service. In the absence of head-to-head data, relative efficacy was derived from a network meta-analysis. Patient cohort characteristics were derived from the AWARD-2 trial. All patients were assumed to remain on treatment for 2 years before escalating to insulin therapy. Costs included treatment costs and costs associated with long-term complications of T2DM. Utilities were estimated based on a recent systematic review. One-way sensitivity analyses (OWSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were conducted. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were generated. RESULTS: Dulaglutide 1.5 mg was associated with lower costs (lifetime costs euro41,562 vs euro43,021) and increased health benefits (lifetime quality-adjusted life years: QALYs 9.804 vs 9.757) versus exenatide QW for the treatment of T2DM in France. OWSA and PSA indicated that results were robust across a range of plausible input parameters. The CEAC indicated a 99.5% probability that dulaglutide would be considered cost-effective at a willingness to pay of euro30,000. CONCLUSION: Dulaglutide 1.5 mg reduced expected costs and increased expected QALYs when compared against exenatide QW for the treatment of T2DM in France. Compared with exenatide QW, dulaglutide 1.5 mg can provide additional health benefits for patients with T2DM and may result in cost savings for payers.

17642,Cost-effectiveness of lobectomy versus genetic testing (Afirma(R)) for indeterminate thyroid nodules: Considering the costs of surveillance,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated whether diagnostic thyroidectomy for indeterminate thyroid nodules would be more cost-effective than genetic testing after including the costs of long-term surveillance. METHODS: We used a Markov decision model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of thyroid lobectomy versus genetic testing (Afirma(R)) for evaluation of indeterminate (Bethesda 3-4) thyroid nodules. The base case was a 40-year-old woman with a 1-cm indeterminate nodule. Probabilities and estimates of utilities were obtained from the literature. Cost estimates were based on Medicare reimbursements with a 3% discount rate for costs and quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS: During a 5-year period after the diagnosis of indeterminate thyroid nodules, lobectomy was less costly and more effective than Afirma(R) (lobectomy: $6,100; 4.50 quality-adjusted life- years vs Afirma(R): $9,400; 4.47 quality-adjusted life-years). Only in 253 of 10,000 simulations (2.5%) did Afirma(R) show a net benefit at a cost-effectiveness threshold of $100,000 per quality- adjusted life-years. There was only a 0.3% probability of Afirma(R) being cost saving and a 14.9% probability of improving quality-adjusted life-years. CONCLUSIONS: Our base case estimate suggests that diagnostic lobectomy dominates genetic testing as a strategy for ruling out malignancy of indeterminate thyroid nodules. These results, however, were highly sensitive to estimates of utilities after lobectomy and living under surveillance after Afirma(R).",2017-01-24246,29128178,Surgery,Courtney J Balentine,2017,/,,No,29128178,"Courtney J Balentine; David J Vanness; David F Schneider; Cost-effectiveness of lobectomy versus genetic testing (Afirma(R)) for indeterminate thyroid nodules: Considering the costs of surveillance, Surgery, 2017 Mar 25; ():0039-6060",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Diagnostic lobectomy vs. Genetic testing(Afirma),a 40 year old women with indeterminate thyroid nodule,40 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,-110000,United States,2016,-118618.25
17643,Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Nivolumab for Treatment of Platinum-Resistant Recurrent or Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck,"Background: The CheckMate 141 trial found that nivolumab improved survival for patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer (HNC). Despite the improved survival, nivolumab is much more expensive than standard therapies. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab for the treatment of HNC. Methods: We constructed a Markov model to simulate treatment with nivolumab or standard single-agent therapy for patients with recurrent or metastatic platinum-refractory HNC. Transition probabilities, including disease progression, survival, and probability of toxicity, were derived from clinical trial data, while costs (in 2017 US dollars) and health utilities were estimated from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), expressed as dollar per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), were calculated, with values of less than $100 000/QALY considered cost-effective from a health care payer perspective. We conducted one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess model uncertainty. Results: Our base case model found that treatment with nivolumab increased overall cost by $117 800 and improved effectiveness by 0.400 QALYs compared with standard therapy, leading to an ICER of $294 400/QALY. The model was most sensitive to the cost of nivolumab, though nivolumab only became cost-effective if the cost per cycle decreased from $13 432 to $3931. The model was not particularly sensitive to assumptions about survival. If one assumed that all patients alive at the end of the CheckMate 141 trial were cured of their disease, nivolumab was still not cost-effective (ICER $244 600/QALY).

17644,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of afatinib after platinum-based therapy for the treatment of squamous non-small-cell lung cancer in France,"Background and aims: Lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of all cancers worldwide. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and has an extremely poor prognosis. Afatinib is an irreversible ErbB family blocker designed to suppress cellular signaling and inhibit cellular growth and is approved in Europe after platinum-based therapy for squamous NSCLC. The objective of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of afatinib after platinum-based therapy for squamous NSCLC in France. Methods: The study population was based on the LUX-Lung 8 trial that compared afatinib with erlotinib in patients with squamous NSCLC. The analysis was performed from the perspective of all health care funders and affected patients. A partitioned survival model was developed to evaluate cost-effectiveness based on progression-free survival and overall survival in the trial. Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct costs were evaluated over a 10-year time horizon. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 4% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Model projections indicated that afatinib was associated with greater life expectancy (0.16 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.094 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]) than that projected for erlotinib. The total cost of treatment over a 10-year time horizon was higher for afatinib than erlotinib, EUR12,364 versus EUR9,510, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of EUR30,277 per QALY gained for afatinib versus erlotinib. Sensitivity analyses showed that the base case findings were stable under variation of a range of model inputs. Conclusion: Based on data from the LUX-Lung 8 trial, afatinib was projected to improve clinical outcomes versus erlotinib, with a 97% probability of being cost-effective assuming a willingness to pay of EUR70,000 per QALY gained, after platinum-based therapy in patients with squamous NSCLC in France.",2017-01-24255,29123418,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Maud Pignata,2017,9 /,655-668,No,29123418,"Maud Pignata; Christos Chouaid; Katell Le Lay; Laura Luciani; Ceilidh McConnachie; James Gordon; Stephane Roze; Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of afatinib after platinum-based therapy for the treatment of squamous non-small-cell lung cancer in France, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , 2017; 9():1178-6981; 655-668",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,Not Stated,afatinib vs. Standard/Usual Care- erlotinib,Patients with squamous non-small-cell lung cancer who experienced disease progression during or following treatment with platinum based chemotherapy,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,4.00,4.00,30277,Euro,2016,36128.23

This study compared the cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography-computed tomography based isotoxic accelerated sequential chemo-radiation (SRT2) and concurrent chemo-radiation with daily low-dose cisplatin (CRT2) with standard sequential (SRT1) and concurrent chemo-radiation (CRT1). METHODS: We used an externally validated mathematical model to simulate the four treatment strategies. The model was built using data from 200 NSCLC patients treated with curative sequential chemo-radiation. For concurrent strategies, data from a meta-analysis and a single study were included in the model. Costs, utilities, and resource use estimates were obtained from literature. Primary outcomes were the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of each strategy. Scenario analyses were carried out to investigate the impact of uncertainty. RESULTS: Total undiscounted costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for SRT1, CRT1, SRT2, and CRT2 were EUR 17,288, EUR 18,756, EUR 19,072, EUR 17,360 and QALYs 1.10, 1.15, 1.40, and 1.40, respectively.

17647,MODEL-BASED COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF CONVENTIONAL AND INNOVATIVE CHEMO-RADIATION IN LUNG CANCER,"INTRODUCTION: Optimizing radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy through advanced imaging and accelerated radiation schemes shows promising results in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study compared the cost-effectiveness of positron emission tomography-computed tomography based isotoxic accelerated sequential chemo-radiation (SRT2) and concurrent chemo-radiation with daily low-dose cisplatin (CRT2) with standard sequential (SRT1) and concurrent chemo-radiation (CRT1). METHODS: We used an externally validated mathematical model to simulate the four treatment strategies. The model was built using data from 200 NSCLC patients treated with curative sequential chemo-radiation. For concurrent strategies, data from a meta-analysis and a single study were included in the model. Costs, utilities, and resource use estimates were obtained from literature. Primary outcomes were the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of each strategy. Scenario analyses were carried out to investigate the impact of uncertainty. RESULTS: Total undiscounted costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for SRT1, CRT1, SRT2, and CRT2 were EUR 17,288, EUR 18,756, EUR 19,072, EUR 17,360 and QALYs 1.10, 1.15, 1.40, and 1.40, respectively. Compared with SRT1, the ICURs were EUR 38,024/QALY for CRT1, EUR 6,249/QALY for SRT2, and EUR 346/QALY for CRT2. CRT2 was highly cost-effective compared with SRT1. Moreover, CRT2 was more effective and less costly than CRT1 and SRT2. Therefore, these strategies were dominated by CRT2. CONCLUSION: Optimized sequential and concurrent chemo-radiation strategies are more effective and cost-effective than the current conventional sequential and concurrent strategies.

17648,Cost-effectiveness of colchicine treatment on post-operative atrial fibrillation events in patients of major cardiac surgery,"Background: Post-operative atrial fibrillation (POAF) occurs in 20-50% of patients amid post-operative stay after Cardiac Surgery. We intend to determine whether colchicine therapy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is a cost-effective strategy for prevention of postoperative atrial fibrillation. To undertake cost utility analysis and calculate ICUR for colchicine therapy in these subgroup of patients. Design: Decision tree model to calculate the incremental cost utility ratio comparing two treatment strategies in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. One wherein patients received colchicine along with usual care and second where they received placebo or just usual care. Cost utility analysis was undertaken using relevant data from the systematic review and meta-analysis12 of the available RCT''s till June 2016 and mean cost calculations from validated available sources across various jurisdictions. Results: Colchicine treatment based on mean costs for life expectancy calculated at 10 years'' post-surgery using recommended discounting rates of 3.5% was euro17521.60 cheaper per QALY gained. The incremental cost is negative and the incremental effect (QALY) is positive (SE quadrant), Hence the intervention of colchicine treatment is unequivocally cost-effective, meaning it is dominant and achieves better outcomes at a lower cost. Conclusion: Our findings provide a benchmark for current and future analyses relating to effectiveness of colchicine on POAF events after cardiac surgery. Currently, there are few reports that provide cutting edge estimates of the higher expenses associated with POAF. Future analyses should likewise explore the impact of added costs from using pharmacologic efforts to prevent and treat POAF after cardiac surgery.",2017-01-24261,29121194,Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes,Manish Barman,2017,/,,No,29121194,"Manish Barman; Mahmoud Tantawy; Mark Sopher; Carsten Lennerz; Cost-effectiveness of colchicine treatment on post-operative atrial fibrillation events in patients of major cardiac surgery, Eur Heart J Qual Care Clin Outcomes, 2017 Nov 07; ():2058-1742",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Colchicine vs. Standard/Usual Care- usual care,Unselected patients undergoing cardiac surgery,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,-17544.8,Euro,2016,-20935.45
17649,Cost-utility of COBRA-light versus COBRA therapy in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis: the COBRA-light trial,"Objective: To evaluate if COmbinatie therapie Bij Reumatoide Artritis (COBRA)-light therapy is cost-effective in treating patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with COBRA therapy. Methods: This economic evaluation was performed next to the open-label, randomised non-inferiority COBRA-light trial in 164 patients with early RA. Non-responders to COBRA or COBRA-light received etanercept (50 mg/week) for 3-6 months. The societal perspective analysis took medical direct, non-medical direct and indirect costs into account. Costs were measured with patient cost diaries for the follow-up period of 52 weeks. Bootstrapping techniques estimated uncertainty around the cost-effectiveness ratios, presented in cost-effectiveness planes. Results: 164 patients were randomised to either COBRA or COBRA-light strategy. At week 52, COBRA-light proved to be non-inferior to COBRA therapy on all clinical outcome measures. The results of the base-case cost-utility analysis (intention-to-treat analyses) revealed that COBRA-light strategy is more expensive (keuro9.3 (SD 0.9) compared with COBRA (keuro7.2 (SD 0.8)), but the difference in costs were not significant (keuro2.0; 95% CI -0.3 to 4.4). Also, both strategies produced similar quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The sensitivity analyses showed robustness of these results. In a per-protocol sensitivity analysis, in which costs of etanercept were assumed to be provided as prescribed according to protocol, both arms had much higher costs: COBRA-light: keuro11.5 (8.3) compared with keuro8.5 (6.8) for COBRA, and the difference in costs was significant (keuro2.9; 0.6 to 5.3). Conclusions: In the base-case cost-utility analysis, the two strategies produced similar QALYs for similar costs. But it is anticipated that if protocol had been followed correctly, the COBRA-light strategy would have been more costly due to additional etanercept costs, for a limited health gain. Given the limited added benefit and high costs of starting etanercept in the presence of low disease activity in our trial, such a strategy needs better justification than is available now.

17650,Cost-effectiveness analysis of infant pneumococcal vaccination with PHiD-CV in Korea,"BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) can cause invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD), pneumonia, and acute otitis media (AOM). Both the 10-valent pneumococcal NTHi protein D conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) and the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV-13) are included in the National Immunization Program for infants in Korea. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the 3+1 schedule of PHiD-CV versus that of PCV-13 for National Immunization Program in Korea. METHODS: A published Markov model was adapted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating the 2012 birth cohort with PHiD-CV vs. PCV-13 from the Korean government perspective over 10 y. Best available published data were used for epidemiology, vaccine efficacy and disutilities. Data on incidence and direct medical costs were taken from the national insurance claims database. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the robustness of the results. RESULTS: PHiD-CV was projected to prevent an additional 195,262 cases of pneumococcal diseases and NTHi-related diseases vs. PCV-13, with a substantially greater reduction in NTHi-related AOM and a comparable reduction in IPD and community-acquired pneumonia. Parity-priced PHiD-CV generated a health gain of about 844 quality-adjusted life years and a total cost-saving of approximately 4 million United States Dollars (USD) over 10 y. 93% of probabilistic simulations found PHiD-CV 3+1 to be the dominant vaccine option. CONCLUSION: Compared to PCV-13, PHiD-CV was projected to provide similar prevention against IPD and community-acquired pneumonia but would prevent more cases of AOM.

17651,Cost-effectiveness of Strategies for Offering Influenza Vaccine in the Pediatric Emergency Department,"Importance: Influenza is a significant public health burden, causing morbidity and mortality in children, yet vaccination rates remain low. Vaccination in the pediatric emergency department (PED) setting may be beneficial but, to date, has not been proven to be cost-effective. Objective: To compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 strategies for PED-based influenza vaccine: offering vaccine to all patients, only to patients younger than 5 years, only to high-risk patients (all ages), or to no patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: Using commercial decision analysis software, a cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from January 1, 2016, to June 1, 2017, to compare influenza vaccine strategies at a tertiary, urban, freestanding PED with an estimated 60000 visits per year among a hypothetical cohort of children visiting the above PED during influenza season. Sensitivity analyses estimated the effect of uncertainties across a variety of input variables (eg, influenza prevalence, vaccine price and effectiveness, and costs of complications). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were cost and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in dollars per influenza case averted. Secondary outcomes included total societal costs, hospitalizations and deaths averted, and quality-adjusted life-years gained. Results: Offering influenza vaccine to all eligible patients has the lowest cost, at $114.45 (95% CI, $55.48-$245.45) per case of influenza averted. This strategy saves $33.51 (95% CI, $18-$62) per case averted compared with no vaccination, and averages 27 fewer cases of influenza per 1000 patients. Offering vaccine to all patients resulted in 0.72 days (95% CI, 0.18-1.78 days) of quality-adjusted life-years lost, whereas offering to none resulted in 0.91 days (95% CI, 0.25-2.2 days) of quality-adjusted life-years lost. In sensitivity analyses, this strategy remains robustly cost-effective across a wide range of assumptions. In addition to being the most cost-effective strategy regardless of age or risk status, routine vaccination in the PED results in a net societal monetary benefit under many circumstances. In Monte Carlo analysis, offering vaccine to all patients was superior to other strategies in at least 99.8% of cases. Conclusions and Relevance: Although few PEDs routinely offer influenza vaccination, doing so appears to be cost-effective, with the potential to significantly reduce the economic (and patient) burden of pediatric influenza.",2017-01-24267,29114729,JAMA Pediatr,Rebecca J Hart,2017,/,e173879,No,29114729,"Rebecca J Hart; Michelle D Stevenson; Michael J Smith; A Scott LaJoie; Keith Cross; Cost-effectiveness of Strategies for Offering Influenza Vaccine in the Pediatric Emergency Department, JAMA Pediatr, 2017 May 01; ():2168-6211; e173879",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vaccine offer to all patients vs. Vaccine offer to no patients,Cohort of children visiting Pediatric Emergency Department during Influenza Season,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,55258,United States,2015,60339.04
17652,Adding Azithromycin to Cephalosporin for Cesarean Delivery Infection Prophylaxis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of adding azithromycin to standard cephalosporin regimens of cesarean delivery prophylaxis by considering the maternal outcomes in the current and potential subsequent pregnancies. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was created using TreeAge to compare the outcomes of using azithromycin-cephalosporin with cephalosporin alone in a theoretical cohort of 700,000 women, the approximate number of nonelective cesarean deliveries annually in the United States that occur during labor or after membrane rupture. Outcomes examined included endometritis, wound infection, sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and maternal death in the current pregnancy and uterine rupture, cesarean hysterectomy, and maternal death in subsequent pregnancies, including cost and quality-adjusted life-years for both pregnancies. Probabilities, utilities, and costs were derived from the literature, and a cost-effectiveness threshold was set at $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Sensitivity analyses were used to determine the robustness of our results. RESULTS: Compared with cephalosporin alone for prophylaxis, our model showed 16,100 fewer cases of endometritis, 17 fewer cases of sepsis, eight fewer cases of venous thromboembolism, and one fewer maternal death with azithromycin-cephalosporin. Additionally, this strategy prevented 36 uterine ruptures and four cesarean hysterectomies in the subsequent pregnancy. Overall, the addition of azithromycin led to both lower costs and higher quality-adjusted life-years when compared with standard cephalosporin prophylaxis. In sensitivity analysis, we found that as long as the cost of azithromycin remained below $930 (baseline cost $27), it was cost-effective. CONCLUSION: For women who undergo cesarean delivery in labor or after membrane rupture, compared with cephalosporin alone, the addition of azithromycin to cesarean delivery infection prophylaxis is less costly and leads to better maternal outcomes in the index delivery and subsequent deliveries. These findings support the use of prophylactic azithromycin at the time of cesarean delivery.",2017-01-24271,29112658,Obstet Gynecol,Ashley E Skeith,2017,/,,No,29112658,"Ashley E Skeith; Brenda Niu; Amy M Valent; Methodius G Tuuli; Aaron B Caughey; Adding Azithromycin to Cephalosporin for Cesarean Delivery Infection Prophylaxis: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, Obstet Gynecol, 2017 Nov 03; ():0029-7844",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Azithromycin plus Cephalosporin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Cephalosporin,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-12500,United States,2017,-13198.18
17653,Cost-effectiveness of Trifluridine/tipiracil for Previously Treated Metastatic Colorectal Cancer in England and Wales,"BACKGROUND: Treatment options at third-line and beyond for patients with late-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) are limited, and outcomes are poor with best supportive care (BSC). This study investigated the cost-effectiveness of trifluridine/tipiracil and regorafenib relative to BSC alone in patients with mCRC who have been previously treated with, or are not considered candidates for, standard chemotherapies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A partitioned survival model was constructed to assess the lifetime costs and benefits accrued by patients. Clinical data were derived from the pivotal phase III (Randomized, Double-Blind, Phase 3 Study of TAS-102 plus Best Supportive Care [BSC] versus Placebo plus BSC in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Refractory to Standard Chemotherapies [RECOURSE]) and supporting phase II (J003-10040030) randomized controlled trial of trifluridine/tipiracil + BSC versus placebo + BSC, as well as the phase III Colorectal Cancer Treated With Regorafenib or Placebo After Failure of Standard Therapy (CORRECT) randomized controlled trial of regorafenib, and were extrapolated to estimate lifetime outcomes. Costs were taken from published sources, and health effects sourced from previous mCRC studies. RESULTS: Trifluridine/tipiracil was associated with a 0.27 incremental life year versus BSC alone, which corresponds to a 0.17 quality-adjusted life year gain. The incremental cost of treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil was pound8,479, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound51,194 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Trifluridine/tipiracil was shown to dominate regorafenib (improve outcomes with reduced costs). Sensitivity analyses showed principal areas of uncertainty were survival estimates and patient utility.

17656,Economic Evaluation of Implementing a Novel Pharmacogenomic Test (IDgenetix(R)) to Guide Treatment of Patients with Depression and/or Anxiety,"BACKGROUND: The response to therapeutics varies widely in patients with depression and anxiety, making selection of an optimal treatment choice challenging. IDgenetix(R), a novel pharmacogenomic test, has been shown to improve outcomes by predicting the likelihood of response to different psychotherapeutic medications. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of implementing a novel pharmacogenomic test (IDgenetix(R)) to guide treatment choices in patients with depression and/or anxiety compared with treatment as usual from the US societal perspective. METHODS: We developed a discrete event simulation to compare clinical events, quality-adjusted life-years, and costs of the two treatment strategies. Target patients had a Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Score >/= 20 and/or a Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety score >/= 18 at baseline. Remission, response, and no response were simulated based on the observed rates in the IDgenetix(R) randomized controlled trial. Quality-adjusted life-years and direct and indirect costs attributable to depression and anxiety were estimated and compared over a 3-year time horizon. We conducted extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The model predicted cumulative remission rates of 78 and 66% in IDgenetix(R) and treatment as usual groups, respectively. Estimated discounted quality-adjusted life-years were 2.09 and 1.94 per patient for IDgenetix(R) and treatment as usual, respectively, which resulted in 0.15 incremental quality-adjusted life-years (95% credible interval 0.04-0.28). The total costs after accounting for a US$2000 test cost were US$14,124 for IDgenetix(R) compared with US$14,659 for treatment as usual, suggesting a US$535 (95% credible interval - 2902 to 1692) cost saving per patient in the IDgenetix(R) group. Incremental quality-adjusted life-year gain (0.49) and cost savings (US$6800) were substantially larger in patients with severe depression (Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score >/= 25). CONCLUSION: Using the IDgenetix(R) test to guide the treatment of patients with depression and anxiety may be a dominant strategy, as it improves quality-adjusted life-years and decreases overall costs over a 3-year time horizon.",2017-01-24277,29110140,Pharmacoeconomics,Mehdi Najafzadeh,2017,35 / 12,1297-1310,Yes,29110140,"Mehdi Najafzadeh; Jorge A Garces; Alejandra Maciel; Economic Evaluation of Implementing a Novel Pharmacogenomic Test (IDgenetix(R)) to Guide Treatment of Patients with Depression and/or Anxiety, Pharmacoeconomics, 2017 Dec; 35(12):1179-2027; 1297-1310",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,IDgenetix- guided treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- Treatment As Usual,patients with moderate to severe depression and/or anxiety,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"3 Years, Lifetime, 12 weeks,1,2,10 years",3.00,3.00,-3566.67,United States,2017,-3765.88
17657,Cost and cost-effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab in the real world setting: A study of the Southeast Netherlands Breast Cancer Consortium,"Background: We assessed the real world costs and cost-effectiveness of the addition of trastuzumab in HER2 positive early breast cancer compared to chemotherapy alone in the Dutch daily practice as opposed to the results based on trial data and based on a subset of patients that were treated according to the guidelines. Patients and Methods: In a cohort study, we included all patients with stage I-III invasive breast cancer treated with curative intent in 5 Dutch hospitals between 2005 and 2007 (n=2684).We assessed three scenarios: a real-world scenario, a trial scenario and a guideline scenario, with costs and effectiveness based on either the cohort study, the published trials or the guidelines. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were constructed. Results: Costs were euro243,216 and euro239,657 for trastuzumab and no trastuzumab for the real world scenario, euro224,443 and euro218,948 for the guideline scenario and euro253,666 and euro265,116 for the trial scenario.

17660,Cost-effectiveness of screening type 2 diabetes patients for chronic kidney disease progression with the CKD273 urinary peptide classifier as compared to urinary albumin excretion,"Background: In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients, chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression may occur without detectable changes in urinary albumin excretion (UAE) rate. A new urinary peptide classifier (CKD273) has exhibited greater ability to detect CKD progression, however, its cost-effectiveness remains unknown. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of screening for CKD progression with the CKD273 classifier, as compared to UAE, in diabetic patients. Methods: A decision-analytic Markov model was developed to estimate costs and health outcomes [including overall survival and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)] from a health system perspective for adopting a new annual screening strategy based on the CKD273 classifier as compared to annual UAE-based screening in a hypothetical cohort of T2DM patients. High-risk patients were defined as T2DM patients with at least one concomitant risk factor (i.e. patients with background genetic risk for developing the disease, obesity, hypertension and/or smoking history) for developing diabetic nephropathy secondary to cardiovascular disease (CVD)-related complications. Low-risk T2DM patients, were defined as those not having any of the aforementioned concomitant risk factors. Results: Over the projected course of a patient''s lifetime, in all T2DM patients annual screening with the CKD273 classifier was more costly, but also more effective, than annual screening with UAE. The incremental costs incurred with screening based on the CKD273 classifier were euro3,053 per patient, while patients gained 0.13 QALYs. Hence, in all patients, annual screening with the CKD273 classifier was cost effective [incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) euro23,903/QALY gained], notably below current government thresholds for funding such health care interventions. For patients at high risk of developing diabetic nephropathy secondary to CVD-related complications, screening based on the CKD273 classifier was cost-saving (i.e. dominant, being both more effective and less expensive than UAE-based screening). Finally, in low-risk patients, CKD273 classifier-based screening was not cost effective (ICER euro73,140/QALY) given current government willingness-to-pay thresholds. Conclusions: In diabetic patients, annual CKD273 classifier-based screening is more costly but also more effective in QALYs gained as compared to UAE. From a health provider perspective, the observed benefits are greatest when such screening is implemented in patients at high risk for diabetes-associated renal or cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).",2017-01-24283,29106632,Nephrol Dial Transplant,Elena Critselis,2017,/,,No,29106632,"Elena Critselis; Antonia Vlahou; Vianda S Stel; Rachael L Morton; Cost-effectiveness of screening type 2 diabetes patients for chronic kidney disease progression with the CKD273 urinary peptide classifier as compared to urinary albumin excretion, Nephrol Dial Transplant, 2017 Jul 03; ():0931-0509",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Annually screening type 2 diabetic patients with CKD273 peptide classifier (all patients) vs. Standard/Usual Care- Annually screening type 2 diabetic patients with urinary albumin excretion (UAE),Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,23903,Euro,2015,28964.94
17661,Cost-effectiveness of Bezlotoxumab Compared With Placebo for the Prevention of Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection,"Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is the most commonly recognized cause of recurrent diarrhea. Bezlotoxumab, administered concurrently with antibiotics directed against C. difficile (standard of care [SoC]), has been shown to reduce the recurrence of CDI, compared with SoC alone. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of bezlotoxumab administered concurrently with SoC, compared with SoC alone, in subgroups of patients at risk of recurrence of CDI. Methods: A computer-based Markov health state transition model was designed to track the natural history of patients infected with CDI. A cohort of patients entered the model with either a mild/moderate or severe CDI episode, and were treated with SoC antibiotics together with either bezlotoxumab or placebo. The cohort was followed over a lifetime horizon, and costs and utilities for the various health states were used to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Both deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to test the robustness of the results. Results: The cost-effectiveness model showed that, compared with placebo, bezlotoxumab was associated with 0.12 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and was cost-effective in preventing CDI recurrences in the entire trial population, with an ICER of $19824/QALY gained. Compared with placebo, bezlotoxumab was also cost-effective in the subgroups of patients aged >/=65 years (ICER of $15298/QALY), immunocompromised patients (ICER of $12597/QALY), and patients with severe CDI (ICER of $21430/QALY).

17662,Cost-effectiveness analysis of tissue plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke in Iran,"AIMS: Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is used to treat acute ischemic stroke up to 4.5 hours after symptom onset. Its cost-effectiveness in developing countries is not specified yet. This study aimed to study cost-effectiveness of tPA in Iran. METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the third party payer to compare IV tPA with no tPA of ischemic stroke. A Markov model with a lifetime horizon was used to analyze the costs and outcomes. Cost data were extracted from the 94 patients admitted in two hospitals in Iran. All costs were calculated based on US dollar in 2016. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were extracted from previously published literature. Cost effectiveness was determined by calculating ICER by TreeAge Pro 2011 software. RESULTS: Lifetime costs of no tPA strategy were higher than tPA ($10,718 in no tPA group compared with $8,796 in tPA group). The tPA arm gained 0.20 QALY compared with no tPA. ICER was $8,471 per QALY. ICER value suggests that tPA is cost-effective compared with no tPA. LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the present study are the reliance on calculated QALY value of other countries and difficulty in accessing patients treated with tPA. CONCLUSIONS: The balance of hospitalization and rehabilitation costs and QALYs support the conclusion that treatment with intravenous tPA in the 4.5 hour time window is cost-effective from the perspectives of third party payer and inclusion of tPA in the insurance benefit package is reasonable.",2017-01-24288,29105528,J Med Econ,Asrin Amiri,2017,/,1-15,Yes,29105528,"Asrin Amiri; Reza Goudarzi; Mohammadreza Amiresmaili; Farhad Iranmanesh; Cost-effectiveness analysis of tissue plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke in Iran, J Med Econ, 2017 May 22; ():1369-6998; 1-15",QALY,Iran,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tissue Plasminogen Activator vs. Standard/Usual Care- No Tissue Plasminogen Activator,patients with ischemic stroke from 2 Iranian hospitals,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 1 year",6.00,3.00,-9201.14,United States,2016,-9922.03
17663,Cost-effectiveness of nivolumab for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer,"OBJECTIVE: Nivolumab is the first drug to demonstrate a survival benefit for platinum-refractory recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer. We performed a cost-utility analysis to assess the economic value of nivolumab as compared to alternative standard agents in this context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the CheckMate 141 trial, we constructed a Markov simulation model from the US payer''s perspective to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab compared to physician choice of either cetuximab, methotrexate or docetaxel. Alternative strategies considered included: single-agent cetuximab, methotrexate or docetaxel, or first testing for PD-L1 to select for nivolumab. Costs were extracted from Medicare and utilities from the literature and CheckMate. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was used to evaluate parameter uncertainty. $100,000/QALY was the primary threshold for cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: When comparing nivolumab to the standard arm of CheckMate, nivolumab demonstrated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $140,672/QALY. When comparing standard therapies, methotrexate was the most cost-effective with similar results for docetaxel. Nivolumab was cost-effective compared to single-agent cetuximab (ICER $89,786/QALY). Treatment selection by PD-L1 immunohistochemistry did not markedly improve the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab. Factors likely to positively impact the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab include better baseline quality-of-life, poor tolerability of standard treatments and/or a lower cost of nivolumab. CONCLUSIONS: Nivolumab is preferred to single-agent cetuximab but requires a willingness-to-pay of at least $150,000/QALY to be considered cost-effective when compared to docetaxel or methotrexate. Selection by PD-L1 does not markedly improve the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab.

DESIGN: A cohort of 54 patients with recurrent GBM treated with ddTMZ+mEHT in 2000-2005 was systematically retrospectively compared with five pooled ddTMZ 21/28 days cohorts (114 patients) enrolled in 2008-2013. RESULTS: The ddTMZ+mEHT cohort had a not significantly improved mean survival time (mST) versus the comparator (p=0.531) after a significantly less mean number of cycles (1.56 vs 3.98, p<0.001). Effect-to-treatment analysis (ETA) suggests that mEHT significantly enhances the efficacy of the ddTMZ 21/28 days regimen (p=0.011), with significantly less toxicity (no grade III-IV toxicity vs 45%-92%, p<0.0001).

After confirmation of the results, mEHT could be recommended for the treatment of recurrent GBM as a cost-effective enhancer of ddTMZ regimens, and, probably, of the regular 5/28 days regimen. mEHT is applicable also as a single treatment if chemotherapy is impossible, and as a salvage treatment after the failure of chemotherapy.",2017-01-24293,29102988,BMJ Open,Sergey V Roussakow,2017,7 / 11,e017387,No,29102988,"Sergey V Roussakow; Clinical and economic evaluation of modulated electrohyperthermia concurrent to dose-dense temozolomide 21/28 days regimen in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma: a retrospective analysis of a two-centre German cohort trial with systematic comparison and effect-to-treatment analysis, BMJ Open , 2017 Nov 17; 7(11):2044-6055; e017387",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,temozolomide (from Abacigolu) vs. comparator from Abacigolu,patients with WHO 4 Glioblastoma multiforme,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,-92899.45,Euro,2015,-112572.76
17668,Cost-Effectiveness of Osimertinib for EGFR Mutation-Positive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer after Progression following First-Line EGFR TKI Therapy,"INTRODUCTION: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) T790M mutation after the failure of first-line EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) therapy. METHODS: A mathematical model was established by combining a decision tree and the Markov approach to project the cost-effectiveness of osimertinib for the treatment of patients who harbor an EGFR T790M mutation compared to that of standard chemotherapy, who had disease progression after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy with or without metastases to the central nervous system. The clinical and outcome data were derived from randomized clinical trials and published reports. The health outcome data included the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The cost data were estimated from the perspectives of the payer in the United States and the health care system in China. All costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were presented in 2017 US dollars. Sensitivity and scenario analyses with three different settings of T790M mutation testing were performed. RESULTS: Compared with chemotherapy, molecular testing in plasma and tissue followed by osimertinib treatment yielded an additional 0.434 and 0.379 QALYs in the entire United States population and the central nervous system (CNS) metastases population with an EGFR T790M mutation. For these populations, the incremental cost was US$100,258 and $89,865 per patient, respectively, and the ICERs were $231,007 and $237,109/QALY, respectively. For the entire Chinese population and the Chinese population with CNS metastases, the ICERs were $45,022 and 49,760/QALY, respectively. For those with a known T790M mutation, the ICERs of osimertinib over chemotherapy also exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold. The most influential parameter was the price of osimertinib.

17674,Cost-effectiveness analysis of sensitive relapsed small-cell lung cancer based on JCOG0605 trial,"PURPOSE: Since combined strategy with cisplatin, etoposide, and irinotecan has shown the superiority to topotecan alone as second-line chemotherapy in patients with sensitive relapsed small-cell lung cancer, this study aimed to compare these two treatments based on JCOG0605 trail from Chinese cost-effectiveness perspective. METHODS: Basic medical information was derived from a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial (JCOG0605). A Markov model including three health states: progression-free state, progressive disease (PD), and death, was developed to simulate the process of sensitive relapsed small-cell lung cancer. Cost was calculated from the perspective of Chinese society. Sensitivity analyses were applied to explore the impact of essential variables. RESULTS: Treatment with combination chemotherapy was estimated to increase costs by $6947.32 compared with topotecan alone, with a gain of 0.26 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Thus, the incremental cost-effective ratio was $26720.46/QALY for combination treatment versus monotherapy, which was beyond the threshold of 3 x the per capita GDP of China, $24423.00. The costs of PD state were the most influential factors to the model.

17675,Clinical Outcomes and Cost-Effectiveness of Fractional Flow Reserve-Guided Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Stable Coronary Artery Disease: Three-Year Follow-Up of the FAME 2 Trial (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation),"BACKGROUND : Previous studies found that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) does not improve outcome compared with medical therapy (MT) in patients with stable coronary artery disease, but PCI was guided by angiography alone. FAME 2 trial (Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation) compared PCI guided by fractional flow reserve with best MT in patients with stable coronary artery disease to assess clinical outcomes and cost-effectiveness. METHODS : A total of 888 patients with stable single-vessel or multivessel coronary artery disease with reduced fractional flow reserve were randomly assigned to PCI plus MT (n=447) or MT alone (n=441). Major adverse cardiac events included death, myocardial infarction, and urgent revascularization. Costs were calculated on the basis of resource use and Medicare reimbursement rates. Changes in quality-adjusted life-years were assessed with utilities determined by the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions health survey at baseline and over follow-up. RESULTS : Major adverse cardiac events at 3 years were significantly lower in the PCI group compared with the MT group (10.1% versus 22.0%; P<0.001), primarily as a result of a lower rate of urgent revascularization (4.3% versus 17.2%; P<0.001). Death and myocardial infarction were numerically lower in the PCI group (8.3% versus 10.4%; P=0.28). Angina was significantly less severe in the PCI group at all follow-up points to 3 years. Mean initial costs were higher in the PCI group ($9944 versus $4440; P<0.001) but by 3 years were similar between the 2 groups ($16 792 versus $16 737; P=0.94). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for PCI compared with MT was $17 300 per quality-adjusted life-year at 2 years and $1600 per quality-adjusted life-year at 3 years. The above findings were robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS : PCI of lesions with reduced fractional flow reserve improves long-term outcome and is economically attractive compared with MT alone in patients with stable coronary artery disease.

We conducted an economic evaluation as part of this trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for patients'' use of post-operative healthcare resources and time taken to return to work were collected and costed using publicly available sources. Health-related quality of life, assessed using the Health Utilities Index Mark-3 (HUI-3), was used to derive quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs and QALYs were compared between LIPUS and control (a placebo device) from a payer and societal perspective using non-parametric bootstrapping. All costs are reported in 2015 Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. RESULTS: With a cost per device of $3,995, the mean cost was significantly higher for patients treated with LIPUS versus placebo from a payer (mean increase = $3647, 95% confidence interval (CI) $3244 to $4070; p < 0.001) or a societal perspective (mean increase = $3425, 95% CI $1568 to $5283; p < 0.001).

17678,Cost effectiveness of chemohormonal therapy in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive and non-metastatic high-risk prostate cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of chemohormonal therapy in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive and non-metastatic high-risk prostate cancer. METHODS: An analytical decision model was developed to determine the cost-effectiveness of chemohormonal therapy versus androgen deprivation therapy alone in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and patients with non-metastatic high-risk prostate cancer. The cost-effectiveness in metastatic patients with a high-volume disease was assessed separately. The model used data from randomized clinical trials and drug acquisition costs in Brazil. In addition, the costs of post-progression therapies have been included in this model. The benefits to health are expressed as the quality-adjusted life-years, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Chemohormonal therapy may be associated with improved quality-adjusted life-years for all patient.

17681,Performing Gadoxetic Acid-Enhanced MRI After CT for Guiding Curative Treatment of Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"OBJECTIVE: We determined the cost-effectiveness of two different diagnostic imaging strategies in guiding curative treatment of early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model using as its starting point a cohort of patients aged 55 years with early-stage HCC detected at dynamic multiphasic CT and with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis. The model compared two strategies on the initial workup: conventional CT strategy using dynamic multiphasic CT only and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI strategy using additional gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI after initial CT. A Markov cohort model simulated a cohort of patients after curative or adjuvant treatment, with follow-up over the remaining life expectancy. We analyzed mean life-years gain, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs per person, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). To evaluate results, we performed one-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The life expectancies and QALY were 7.22 years and 5.08 for the conventional CT strategy and 7.79 years and 5.52 for the gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI strategy, respectively. The expected costs were $99,770 for conventional CT and $105,025 for gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI in the United States. The ICER with gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI was $11,957, as opposed to that with conventional CT, which was lower than the cost-effectiveness threshold of $50,000/QALY. One-way, two-way, and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed unchanged results over an acceptable range. CONCLUSION: Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI after CT is cost-effective for detecting additional HCC in patients with early-stage HCC who can undergo curative treatment (besides liver transplantation). The cost-effectiveness of gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI may be considered in the management of patients with early-stage HCC during staging.",2017-01-24319,29091004,AJR Am J Roentgenol,Chong Hyun Suh,2017,/,W1-W7,No,29091004,"Chong Hyun Suh; Kyung Won Kim; Seong Ho Park; So Yeon Kim; Dong-Cheol Woo; Sangjin Shin; Junhee Pyo; Atul B Shinagare; Nikhil H Ramaiya; Young-Suk Lim; Performing Gadoxetic Acid-Enhanced MRI After CT for Guiding Curative Treatment of Early-Stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis, AJR Am J Roentgenol, 2017 Nov 01; ():0361-803X; W1-W7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI strategy using additional gadoxetic acid–enhanced MRI after initial CT vs. Standard/Usual Care- Computed tomography strategy using dynamic multiphasic computed tomography only,early-stage HCC detected at dynamic multiphasic computed tomography and with Child-Pugh class A cirrhosis,55 Years,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,11957,United States,2015,13056.46
17682,Cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole versus piperacillin/tazobactam as initial empiric therapy for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections based on pathogen distributions drawn from national surveillance data in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative pathogens in complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) has increased. In the absence of timely information on the infecting pathogens and their susceptibilities, local or regional epidemiology may guide initial empirical therapy and reduce treatment failure, length of stay and mortality. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole compared with piperacillin/tazobactam in the treatment of hospitalized US patients with cIAI at risk of infection with resistant pathogens. METHODS: We used a decision-analytic Monte Carlo simulation model to compare the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of persons infected with nosocomial gram-negative cIAI treated empirically with either ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole or piperacillin/tazobactam. Pathogen isolates were randomly drawn from the Program to Assess Ceftolozane/Tazobactam Susceptibility (PACTS) database, a surveillance database of non-duplicate bacterial isolates collected from patients with cIAIs in medical centers in the USA from 2011 to 2013. Susceptibility to initial therapy was based on the measured susceptibilities reported in the PACTS database determined using standard broth micro-dilution methods as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). RESULTS: Our model results, with baseline resistance levels from the PACTS database, indicated that ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole dominated piperacillin/tazobactam, with lower costs ($44,226/patient vs. $44,811/patient respectively) and higher QALYs (12.85/patient vs. 12.70/patient, respectively). Ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole remained the dominant choice in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Based on surveillance data, ceftolozane/tazobactam is more likely to be an appropriate empiric therapy for cIAI in the US. Results from a decision-analytic simulation model indicate that use of ceftolozane/tazobactam + metronidazole would result in cost savings and improves QALYs, compared with piperacillin/tazobactam.",2017-01-24321,29090091,Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,Vimalanand S Prabhu,2017,6 /,107,No,29090091,"Vimalanand S Prabhu; Joseph S Solomkin; Goran Medic; Jason Foo; Rebekah H Borse; Teresa Kauf; Benjamin Miller; Shuvayu S Sen; Anirban Basu; Cost-effectiveness of ceftolozane/tazobactam plus metronidazole versus piperacillin/tazobactam as initial empiric therapy for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections based on pathogen distributions drawn from national surveillance data in the United States, Antimicrob Resist Infect Control, 2017; 6():2047-2994; 107",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ceftolozane/ tazobactam + metronidazole vs. Standard/Usual Care- Piperacillin/tazobactam,hospitalized patients at risk of infection with resistant pathogens,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-3900,United States,2015,-4258.61
17683,Cost-utility of stereotactic radiation therapy versus proton beam therapy for inoperable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma,"The cost-utility of proton beam therapy was compared to stereotactic body radiation therapy for inoperable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. A Markov decision-analytic model was performed following time to progression and survival using phase II trial data. Patients transitioned between three health states. Clinical outcomes were estimated for quality of life using utility estimates in the published literature and measured as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefits (NMBs). Real direct medical costs were extracted from the Bureau of National Health Insurance database. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of specific variables on the model. In the base-case scenario, the modeled median survival was 16 months for proton beam therapy and 10 months for SBRT. Proton beam therapy resulted in an additional 2.61 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of NT$ 557,907 compared to SBRT. The ICER was NT$ 213,354 per QALY gained. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis predicted a 97 % chance of proton beam therapy being cost-effective at the willingness to pay NT$2,157,024 per QALY gained.

17684,Cost-Effectiveness of Nalmefene Added to Psychosocial Support for the Reduction of Alcohol Consumption in Alcohol-Dependent Patients With High/Very High Drinking Risk Levels: A Microsimulation Model,"OBJECTIVE: A microsimulation model was adapted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of nalmefene combined with psychosocial support (NMF + PS) versus psychosocial support alone (PS). The economic impact of alcohol reduction using nalmefene treatment was not evaluated. METHOD: The model simulates patient-level alcohol consumption over a 5-year time horizon across different treatment cohorts. Study outcomes included probabilities of alcohol-attributable diseases and injuries as well as deaths from these events. The approach used nalmefene clinical trial data, a time horizon of 1 and 5 years, and a U.K. societal perspective. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Compared with the PS strategy, NMF + PS was associated at Year 5 with a gain of 0.047 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and an additional pound503, leading to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound10,613 per QALY gained. When compared with the strategy without treatment, NMF + PS was associated with a gain of 0.228 QALYs and an additional pound1,795, leading to an ICER of pound1,758 per QALY gained. The NMF + PS strategy dominated both treatment strategies when considering the U.K. societal perspective. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results.

17685,Cost-effectiveness analysis of <vagal nerve blocking for morbid obesity,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the lifetime cost-effectiveness of intermittent, reversible vagal nerve blocking (via the implantable weight loss device vBloc) therapy versus conventional therapy as treatment for patients who are class 2 obese with diabetes and for those who are class 3 obese with or without diabetes, who have found pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapies ineffective, but are not prepared or willing to undergo current bariatric surgical options. STUDY DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness model was designed to simulate weight loss, diabetes remission, and costs in patients with obesity undergoing vagal nerve blocking therapy versus conventional therapy. METHODS: The model compared 2 treatment arms, vagal nerve blocking therapy and conventional therapy, and for each treatment arm included 4 health states based on body mass index (BMI) class. Using Monte Carlo simulation, patients entered the model one at a time and could transition between health states by experiencing BMI change. The model focused on change in BMI and diabetes remission as predictors of healthcare costs, health-related quality of life, and survival. Inputs for vagal nerve blocking effectiveness were obtained from the ReCharge trial; however, remaining inputs were estimated from published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were evaluated in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: ICERs for vagal nerve blocking versus conventional therapy in patients who were class 2 and class 3 obese were estimated to be $17,274 and $21,713 per QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed results to be robust to reasonable variation in model inputs, with the upper limit of ICERs remaining below $30,000 for all sensitivity analysis scenarios assessed.

17687,Pomalidomide with Dexamethasone for Treating Relapsed and Refractory Multiple Myeloma Previously Treated with Lenalidomide and Bortezomib: An Evidence Review Group Perspective of an NICE Single Technology Appraisal,"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as part of the institute''s single technology appraisal (STA) process, invited the manufacturer of pomalidomide (POM; Imnovid(R), Celgene) to submit evidence regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug in combination with dexamethasone (POM + LoDEX) for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) after at least two regimens including lenalidomide (LEN) and bortezomib (BOR). Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR) and Erasmus University Rotterdam were commissioned as the Evidence Review Group (ERG) for this submission. The ERG reviewed the evidence submitted by the manufacturer, validated the manufacturer''s decision analytic model, and conducted exploratory analyses in order to assess the robustness and validity of the presented clinical and cost-effectiveness results. This paper describes the company submission, the ERG assessment, and NICE''s subsequent decisions. The company conducted a systematic review to identify studies comparing POM with comparators outlined in the NICE scope: panobinostat with bortezomib and dexamethasone (PANO + BOR + DEX), bendamustine with thalidomide and dexamethasone (BTD) and conventional chemotherapy (CC). The main clinical effectiveness evidence was obtained from MM-003, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing POM + LoDEX with high-dose dexamethasone (HiDEX; used as a proxy for CC). Additional data from other studies were also used as nonrandomized observational data sources for the indirect treatment comparison of POM + LoDEX with BTD and PANO + BOR + DEX. Covariate or treatment switching adjustment methods were used for each comparison. The model developed in Microsoft(R) Excel 2010 using a semi-Markov partitioned survival structure, submitted in the original submission to NICE for TA338, was adapted for the present assessment of the cost effectiveness of POM + LoDEX. Updated evidence from the clinical-effectiveness part was used for the survival modelling of progression-free survival and overall survival. For POM + LoDEX, the patient access scheme (PAS) discount was applied to the POM price. Three separate comparisons were conducted for each comparator, each comparison using a different dataset and adjustment methods.

The ERG identified and corrected some errors, and the corrected incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for POM + LoDEX versus each comparator were presented: approximately pound45,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained versus BTD, savings of approximately pound143,000 per QALY lost versus PANO + BOR + DEX, and approximately pound49,000 per QALY gained versus CC. The ERG also conducted full incremental analyses, which revealed that CC, POM + LoDEX and PANO + BOR + DEX were on the cost-effectiveness frontier.

17690,Cost-effectiveness of post-landing latent tuberculosis infection control strategies in new migrants to Canada,"BACKGROUND: The majority of tuberculosis in migrants to Canada occurs due to reactivation of latent TB infection. Risk of tuberculosis in those with latent tuberculosis infection can be significantly reduced with treatment. Presently, only 2.4% of new migrants are flagged for post-landing surveillance, which may include latent tuberculosis infection screening; no other migrants receive routine latent tuberculosis infection screening. To aid in reducing the tuberculosis burden in new migrants to Canada, we determined the cost-effectiveness of using different latent tuberculosis infection interventions in migrants under post-arrival surveillance and in all new migrants. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed that focused on a Canadian permanent resident cohort after arrival in Canada, utilizing a ten-year time horizon, healthcare system perspective, and 1.5% discount rate. Latent tuberculosis infection interventions were evaluated in the population under surveillance (N = 6100) and the total cohort (N = 260,600). In all evaluations, six different screening and treatment combinations were compared to the base case of tuberculin skin test screening followed by isoniazid treatment only in the population under surveillance. Quality adjusted life years, incident tuberculosis cases, and costs were recorded for each intervention and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in relation to the base case. RESULTS: In the population under surveillance (N = 6100), using an interferon-gamma release assay followed by rifampin was dominant compared to the base case, preventing 4.90 cases of tuberculosis, a 4.9% reduction, adding 4.0 quality adjusted life years, and saving $353,013 over the ensuing ten-years. Latent tuberculosis infection screening in the total population (N = 260,600) was not cost-effective when compared to the base case, however could potentially prevent 21.8% of incident tuberculosis cases. CONCLUSIONS: Screening new migrants under surveillance with an interferon-gamma release assay and treating with rifampin is cost saving, but will not significantly impact TB incidence.

17696,Is more research always needed? Estimating optimal sample sizes for trials of retention in care interventions for HIV-positive East Africans,"INTRODUCTION: Given the serious health consequences of discontinuing antiretroviral therapy, randomised control trials of interventions to improve retention in care may be warranted. As funding for global HIV research is finite, it may be argued that choices about sample size should be tied to maximising health. METHODS: For an East African setting, we calculated expected value of sample information and expected net benefit of sampling to identify the optimal sample size (greatest return on investment) and to quantify net health gains associated with research. Two hypothetical interventions were analysed: (1) one aimed at reducing disengagement from HIV care and (2) another aimed at finding/relinking disengaged patients. RESULTS: When the willingness to pay (WTP) threshold was within a plausible range (1-3 x GDP; US$1377-4130/QALY), the optimal sample size was zero for both interventions, meaning that no further research was recommended because the pre-research probability of an intervention''s effectiveness and value was sufficient to support a decision on whether to adopt the intervention and any new information gained from additional research would likely not change that decision. In threshold analyses, at a higher WTP of $5200 the optimal sample size for testing a risk reduction intervention was 2750 per arm. For the outreach intervention, the optimal sample size remained zero across a wide range of WTP thresholds and was insensitive to variation. Limitations, including not varying all inputs in the model, may have led to an underestimation of the value of investing in new research. CONCLUSION: In summary, more research is not always needed, particularly when there is moderately robust prestudy belief about intervention effectiveness and little uncertainty about the value (cost-effectiveness) of the intervention.

METHODS: A decision-analytic model in Microsoft Excel was used to compare vedolizumab with conventional therapy (aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators) for the treatment of patients with UC in the UK. We considered the following three populations: the overall intent-to-treat population from the GEMINI I trial, patients naive to anti-TNF therapy, and those who had failed anti-TNF-therapy. Population characteristics and efficacy data were obtained from the GEMINI I trial. Other inputs (eg, unit costs, probability of surgery, mortality) were obtained from published literature. Time horizon was a lifetime horizon, with costs and outcomes discounted by 3.5% per year. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to measure the impact of parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Vedolizumab had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of pound4,095/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), pound4,423/QALY, and pound5,972/QALY compared with conventional therapy in the intent-to-treat, anti-TNF-naive, and anti-TNF-failure populations, respectively.
