6001,Economic analysis of esophageal stenting for management of malignant dysphagia,"Over half of patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer are unsuitable for curative resection. A significant proportion of these patients will subsequently require palliative stenting to alleviate dysphagia. There is growing consensus in the literature that the deployment of a Self-Expanding Metal Stent is the optimum stenting strategy; however, it remains unclear whether covered or uncovered metal stents are more cost-effective. In order to determine which type of prosthesis is more cost-effective, we compared the different stenting strategies in terms of 1-year stent-related mortality, health-related quality of life, and cost. A decision analytical model was constructed to compare the 1-year stent-related mortality, health-related quality of life, and cost between covered and uncovered stents. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to quantify the uncertainty associated with our results. Value of Information analysis was performed to assess the value of further research. In order to fully characterize the uncertainty associated with this decision, plastic stents were included in our analysis. Stent-related mortality was slightly lower following covered stent deployment compared with uncovered stent deployment (1.00% vs. 1.26%). Covered stents were more effective by 0.0013 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (Standard Deviation [SD] 0.0013 Quality-Adjusted Life Years). They were also less expensive by $729.58 (SD $390.63). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggested that these results were not sensitive to model parameter uncertainty. Plastic stents deployment was $2832.64 (SD $1182.72) more expensive than uncovered metal stent deployment. Value of Information analysis suggests that the maximum value of further research in the UK is $61,124.30. The results of this study represent strong evidence for the cost-effectiveness of covered compared with uncovered self-expanding metal stents for the palliation of patients with malignant dysphagia. The findings support previously published literature asserting the dominance of self-expanding metal stents over plastic stents. Value of Information analysis suggests that further research may not be cost-effective.

6003,Using the osteoporosis self-assessment tool for referring older men for bone densitometry: a decision analysis,"OBJECTIVES: To compare health benefits and costs associated with performing bone densitometry for all men with those of risk-stratifying using the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool (OST) and performing bone densitometry only for a high-risk group. DESIGN: A decision analytical model was developed using a Markov process. Three strategies were compared: no bone densitometry, selective bone densitometry using the OST, and universal bone densitometry. Data sources were U.S. epidemiological studies and healthcare cost figures. SETTING: Hypothetical cohort. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling 70-year-old U.S. white men with no history of clinical osteoporotic fractures. INTERVENTION: Five years of alendronate therapy for those diagnosed with osteoporosis. MEASUREMENTS: Life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Selective bone densitometry using the OST would cost $100,700 per additional life year gained compared to the no bone densitometry strategy. Universal bone densitometry would cost $483,500 for additional life year gained compared to selective bone densitometry. When quality of life was considered, both strategies became approximately 15% more cost-effective. Compared with the no bone densitometry strategy, selective bone densitometry would be cost saving for those aged 84 and older, with a reduction of alendronate price (< or =$110 per year), or with a higher efficacy of alendronate (a relative risk reduction of nonvertebral fracture > or =82%). CONCLUSION: Universal bone densitometry for 70-year-old men is not a good investment for society.

6005,Cost-effectiveness of a smoking cessation program implemented at the time of surgery for lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Many patients are active smokers at the time of a diagnosis of surgically resectable lung cancer. Perioperative smoking cessation is associated with improved survival, but the cost-effectiveness of a smoking cessation program initiated immediately before surgery is unknown. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic Markov model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of a formal smoking cessation program. The parameter estimates were taken from the available literature. The model included the cost and effectiveness of the smoking cessation program, cost and incidence of perioperative complications, postoperative mortality, and utility measured in quality adjusted life years (QALY). Dollars per QALY and life year were calculated and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The cost/QALY and cost/life year were $16,415 and $45,629 at 1 year after surgery and $2609 and $2703 at 5 years, respectively. Most sensitivity analyses showed the 1 year postsurgery cost/QALY estimates were less than $50,000, and all were less than $12,000 at 5 years. Cost-effectiveness estimates were most sensitive to the frequency of perioperative complications and the estimated short-term utility estimates.

6012,Cost-effectiveness analysis of an antimicrobial stewardship team on bloodstream infections: a probabilistic analysis,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of Antimicrobial Stewardship Teams (ASTs) on the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with nosocomial bacteraemia. METHODS: A decision analytic model compared costs and outcomes of bacteraemic patients receiving standard treatment with or without an AST consult. Patients with a bacteraemic event during their hospital admission were included in the model. Effectiveness was estimated as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) over the lifetime of patients. Model variables and costs, along with their distributions, were obtained from the literature and expert opinion. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated to estimate the cost per QALY gained from the hospital perspective. Uncertainty in ICERs was evaluated with probabilistic sensitivity analyses. The cost-effectiveness of clinical decision support systems was evaluated as a secondary analysis. RESULTS: Implementing an AST for bacteraemia review cost $39,737 (95% CI $27,272-53, 017) and standard treatment cost $39,563 (95% CI $27,164-52,797). The difference in effectiveness between the two strategies was 0.08 QALYs, and the base case ICER from the probabilistic analysis was $2367 per QALY gained [95% CI dominant (less costly, more effective) to $24,379]. Results from the probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated there was more than a 90% likelihood that an AST would be cost-effective at a level of $10,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Maintaining an AST to improve care for bacteraemia is cost-effective from the hospital perspective.

6013,Cost-effectiveness analysis of endovascular versus neurosurgical treatment for ruptured intracranial aneurysms in the United States,"OBJECT: The results of the International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) demonstrated lower rates of death and disability with endovascular treatment (coiling) than with open surgery (clipping) to secure the ruptured intracranial aneurysm. However, cost-effectiveness may not be favorable because of the greater need for follow-up cerebral angiograms and additional follow-up treatment with endovascular methods. In this study, the authors' goal was to compare the cost-effectiveness of endovascular and neurosurgical treatments in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms who were eligible to undergo either type of treatment. METHODS: Clinical data (age, sex, frequency of retreatment, and rebleeding) and quality of life values were obtained from the ISAT. Total cost included those associated with disability, hospitalization, retreatment, and rebleeding. Cost estimates were derived from the Premier Perspective Comparative Database, data from long-term care in stroke patients, and relevant literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated during a 1-year period. Parametric bootstrapping was used to determine the uncertainty of the estimates. RESULTS: The median estimated costs of endovascular and neurosurgical treatments (in US dollars) were $45,493 (95th percentile range $44,693-$46,365) and $41,769 (95th percentile range $41,094-$42,518), respectively. The overall quality-adjusted life years (QALY) in the endovascular group was 0.69, and for the neurosurgical group it was 0.64. The cost per QALY in the endovascular group was $65,424 (95th percentile range $64,178-$66,772), and in the neurosurgical group it was $64,824 (95th percentile range $63,679-$66,086). The median estimated ICER at 1 year for endovascular treatment versus neurosurgical treatment was $72,872 (95th percentile range $50,344-$98,335) per QALY gained. Given that most postprocedure angiograms and additional treatments occurred in the 1st year and the 1-year disability status is unlikely to change in the future, ICER for endovascular treatment will progressively decrease over time. CONCLUSIONS: Using outcome and economic data obtained in the US at 1 year after the procedure, endovascular treatment is more costly but is associated with better outcomes than the neurosurgical alternative among patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms who are eligible to undergo either procedure. With accrual of additional years with a better outcome status, the ICER for endovascular coiling would be expected to progressively decrease and eventually reverse.",2009-01-05239,19199452,J Neurosurg,Alberto Maud,2009,110 / 5,880-6,No,19199452,"Alberto Maud; Kamakshi Lakshminarayan; M Fareed K Suri; Gabriela Vazquez; Giuseppe Lanzino; Adnan I Qureshi; Cost-effectiveness analysis of endovascular versus neurosurgical treatment for ruptured intracranial aneurysms in the United States, J Neurosurg, 2009-May; 110(5):0022-3085; 880-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular treatment (coiling) vs. Open surgery (clipping),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,72872,United States,2006,93551.96
6014,Quality of life and drug costs associated with switching antipsychotic medication to once-daily extended release quetiapine fumarate in patients with schizophrenia,"ABSTRACT Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the quality of life and drug costs associated with switching from any ongoing antipsychotic treatment to once-daily extended release quetiapine fumarate (quetiapine XR) in patients with schizophrenia. Methods: This assessment was based on data collected during a 12-week study in patients with schizophrenia (n = 477) who switched from their current antipsychotic due to insufficient efficacy or poor tolerability to a flexible dose of quetiapine XR. Patients were assigned utilities based on their Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores and the presence of adverse events by applying the methods of Lenert et al. 1 . Quality adjusted life year (QALY) gains were calculated assuming a linear change of utility between two consecutive visits. Incremental costs were calculated by comparing the hypothetical mean drug cost (assuming patients stay on previous treatment) with the actual mean cost of quetiapine XR based on European prices. Results: Patients who completed the study (n = 279) increased their average utility by 0.116, corresponding to a QALY gain of 0.0207. For the total sample, the mean utility increased by 0.09, reflecting a QALY gain of 0.0170. The additional costs for quetiapine XR per QALY gained varied from approximately euro16,000 to euro24,000. Notably, this is a non-comparative study; therefore, no conclusions can be reached regarding the relative impact of switching to quetiapine XR compared with other antipsychotics. Further limitations included the short trial duration on which the utility estimates are based, and the restriction of cost data to drug costs alone. Furthermore, in a 'real world' scenario, it is to be expected that other drug regimens might be introduced during periods of treatment failure.

6021,A Markov model assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of FOLFOX compared with FOLFIRI for the initial treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of FOLFOX compared with FOLFIRI for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. METHOD: We developed a Markov decision model using a hypothetical cohort of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to compare beginning chemotherapy with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. Probabilities of toxicities, including neutropenia, diarrhea, and neuropathy, were based on published literature for FOLFOX and FOLFIRI. Costs for physician and hospital services unadjusted for geographic location were estimated using Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services reimbursement data. Drug costs were estimated using Medicare B reimbursement and the Federal Supply Schedule. Health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to address uncertainty in the model parameters. RESULTS: The FOLFOX strategy provided 1.003 QALYs at a cost of $29,865, whereas FOLFIRI provided 0.921 QALYs at a cost of $24,551. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for FOLFOX treatment was $65,170/QALY. In 10,000 probabilistic Monte Carlo simulations, FOLFOX was cost-effective in 48.59% of trials using a $50,000/QALY threshold. The most influential variables in univariate sensitivity analysis were the expected years of survival associated with each chemotherapy regimen.

6022,"HIV preexposure prophylaxis in the United States: impact on lifetime infection risk, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness","BACKGROUND: The combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine shows promise as HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We sought to forecast clinical, epidemiologic, and economic outcomes of PrEP, taking into account uncertainties regarding efficacy, the risks of developing drug resistance and toxicity, behavioral disinhibition, and drug costs. METHODS: We adapted a computer simulation of HIV acquisition, detection, and care to model PrEP among men who have sex with men and are at high risk of HIV infection (i.e., 1.6% mean annual incidence of HIV infection) in the United States. Base-case assumptions included 50% PrEP efficacy and monthly tenofovir-emtricitabine costs of $753. We used sensitivity analyses to examine the stability of results and to identify critical input parameters. RESULTS: In a cohort with a mean age of 34 years, PrEP reduced lifetime HIV infection risk from 44% to 25% and increased mean life expectancy from 39.9 to 40.7 years (21.7 to 22.2 discounted quality-adjusted life-years). Discounted mean lifetime treatment costs increased from $81,100 to $232,700 per person, indicating an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $298,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Markedly larger reductions in lifetime infection risk (from 44% to 6%) were observed with the assumption of greater (90%) PrEP efficacy. More-favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were obtained by targeting younger populations with a higher incidence of infection and by improvements in the efficacy and cost of PrEP. CONCLUSIONS: PrEP could substantially reduce the incidence of HIV transmission in populations at high risk of HIV infection in the United States. Although it is unlikely to confer sufficient benefits to justify the current costs of tenofovir-emtricitabine, price reductions and/or increases in efficacy could make PrEP a cost-effective option in younger populations or populations at higher risk of infection. Given recent disappointments in HIV infection prevention and vaccine development, additional study of PrEP-based HIV prevention is warranted.",2009-01-05248,19193111,Clin Infect Dis,A David Paltiel,2009,48 / 6,806-15,No,19193111,"A David Paltiel; Kenneth A Freedberg; Callie A Scott; Bruce R Schackman; Elena Losina; Bingxia Wang; George R Seage; Caroline E Sloan; Paul E Sax; Rochelle P Walensky; HIV preexposure prophylaxis in the United States: impact on lifetime infection risk, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness, Clin Infect Dis, 2009-Mar-15; 48(6):1537-6591; 806-15",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"HIV preexposure prophylaxis-PrEP, (tenofovir and emtricitabine) vs. No preexposure prophylaxis-PrEP",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,298000,United States,2006,382567.85
6023,Cost-effectiveness of pegfilgrastim versus 6-day filgrastim primary prophylaxis in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving CHOP-21 in United States,"OBJECTIVES: Prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) reduces the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Randomized clinical trials have shown that pegfilgrastim, a 2nd-generation G-CSF, is at least as effective as the 1st-generation G-CSF filgrastim. In the meta-analysis of trials pegfilgrastim performed better than filgrastim with respect to FN risk. The incremental cost-effectiveness of primary prophylaxis (starting in cycle 1 and continuing in subsequent cycles of chemotherapy) with pegfilgrastim versus filgrastim used for 6 days (as is often used in clinical practice) was estimated in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy in the United States. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was constructed from a health insurer's perspective with a life-time study horizon. The model considered direct medical costs and outcomes related to reduced FN and potential survival benefits due to reduced FN-related mortality. Inputs for the model were obtained from the medical literature. Sensitivity analyses were conducted across plausible ranges in parameter values. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) of pegfilgrastim versus 6-day filgrastim primary prophylaxis was $2167/FN episode avoided. Adding survival benefit from avoiding FN mortality yielded an ICER of $5532/LY gained or $6190/QALY gained. When the potential benefit of optimized chemotherapy was included, the ICER was $1494/LY gained or $1677/QALY gained. The most influential factors included cost of pegfilgrastim, relative risk of FN between pegfilgrastim and filgrastim, FN case-fatality rate, cost of filgrastim and baseline FN risk. CONCLUSIONS: Pegfilgrastim is cost-effective in primary prophylaxis of FN compared to 6 days per cycle of filgrastim, in patients with NHL receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin + vincristine + prednisolone [CHOP-21]) chemotherapy.

6025,An Economic Evaluation of Valsartan for Post-MI Patients in the UK Who Are Not Suitable for Treatment with ACE Inhibitors,"ABSTRACT Objectives: The overall objective of this study was to estimate the costs and outcomes associated with treatment with valsartan for post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, heart failure, or both, who are not suitable for treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, compared to placebo. Methods: A Markov model, using data drawn from the Valsartan in Acute Myocardial Infarction (VALIANT) trial and other trials, was developed to predict the future health pathways, resource use, and costs for patients who have recently experienced an MI. Patients received either valsartan (mean dose 247 mg) or placebo. Cost data were drawn from national databases and published literature, although health outcome utility weights were derived from existing studies. Patient outcomes were modeled for 10 years, and incremental cost-effective ratios were calculated for valsartan compared with placebo. Results: Over a period of 10 years, a cohort of 1000 patients treated with valsartan experienced 147 fewer cardiovascular deaths, 37 fewer nonfatal MIs, and 95 fewer cases of heart failure than a cohort who received placebo. The incremental cost of valsartan, compared with placebo, was pound2680 per patient, although the incremental effectiveness of valsartan was 0.5021 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per patient. Therefore, the incremental cost per QALY for treatment with valsartan was pound5338. When analysis was undertaken using life-years rather than QALYs, the cost per life-year gained was pound4672. Conclusions: For patients who are not suitable for treatment with ACE inhibitors, valsartan is a viable and cost-effective treatment for their management after an MI.",2009-01-05250,19192258,Value Health,Matthew Taylor,2009,/,,Yes,19192258,"Matthew Taylor; Paul A Scuffham; Stephen Chaplin; Natalie L Papo; An Economic Evaluation of Valsartan for Post-MI Patients in the UK Who Are Not Suitable for Treatment with ACE Inhibitors, Value Health, 2009-Jan-14; ():1098-3015",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Valsartan vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,5338,United Kingdom,2008,11899.63
6026,United States cost-effectiveness study of two dry eye ophthalmic lubricants,"PURPOSE: Dry eye is thought to be the most common ocular problem in the United States. However, it is only recently that it has been recognized as a disease with significant economic burden and impact on quality of life. This article presents an economic model of cost-effectiveness of two ophthalmic lubricants commonly used in the treatment of dry eye-Systane and Refresh Tears. METHOD: We conducted a meta-analysis, pooling the results of two clinical trials of patients with dry eye treated with Systane and Refresh Tears which presented response rates for improvements in ocular dryness, the key symptom of dry eye. An economic model was used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for Systane versus Refresh Tears over a 12 month treatment period. RESULTS: Systane is significantly more effective than Refresh Tears at improving symptoms of ""dryness"" (75% vs 41%). Systane costs on average $57.79 per year more than Refresh Tears. Assigning a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain of 0.03 to responders results in an incremental cost per QALY gain of $5,837. CONCLUSION: Both Refresh Tears and Systane are effective and cost-effective interventions. Systane costs more than Refresh Tears, however clinical trial evidence shows it to be more effective. The ICER for Systane versus Refresh Tears is well below the generally accepted $50,000 per QALY threshold.",2009-01-05251,19191178,Ophthalmic Epidemiol,John Wlodarczyk,2009,16 / 1,22-30,No,19191178,"John Wlodarczyk; Carol Fairchild; United States cost-effectiveness study of two dry eye ophthalmic lubricants, Ophthalmic Epidemiol, 2009 Jan-Feb; 16(1):0928-6586; 22-30",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Systane vs. Refresh Tears,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,5837,United States,2006,7493.45
6027,An economic evaluation of NIOX MINO airway inflammation monitor in the United Kingdom,"BACKGROUND: Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation, is easily measured by noninvasive means. The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of FENO measurement using a hand-held monitor (NIOX MINO), at a reimbursement price of 23 pound sterling, for asthma diagnosis and management in the UK. METHODS: We constructed two decision trees to compare FENO measurement with standard diagnostic testing and guideline recommendations for management. For asthma diagnosis, we compared FENO measurement with lung function and reversibility testing, bronchial provocation and sputum eosinophil count. For asthma management, we evaluated the impact on asthma control, including inhaled corticosteroid use, exacerbations and hospitalizations, of monitoring with FENO measurement vs symptoms and lung function as in standard care. Resource use and health outcomes were evaluated over a 1-year time frame. Direct costs were calculated from a UK health-care payer perspective (2005 pound sterling). RESULTS: An asthma diagnosis using FENO measurement cost 43 pound sterling less per patient as compared with standard diagnostic tests. Asthma management using FENO measurement instead of lung function testing resulted in annual cost-savings of 341 pound sterling and 0.06 quality-adjusted life-years gained for patients with mild to severe asthma and cost-savings of 554 pound sterling and 0.004 quality-adjusted life-years gained for those with moderate to severe asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma diagnosis based on FENO measurement with NIOX MINO alone is less costly and more accurate than standard diagnostic methods. Asthma management based on FENO measurement is less costly than asthma management based on standard guidelines and provides similar health benefits.",2009-01-05260,19183419,Allergy,D Price,2009,64 / 3,431-8,No,19183419,"D Price; J Berg; P Lindgren; An economic evaluation of NIOX MINO airway inflammation monitor in the United Kingdom, Allergy, 2009-Mar; 64(3):0105-4538; 431-8",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Asthma management using a fractional exhaled nitric oxide hand-held monitor (NIOX MINO) vs. Standard diagnostic tests,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-56833.33,United Kingdom,2005,-137102.03
6028,RhBMP-2 versus iliac crest bone graft for lumbar spine fusion in patients over 60 years of age: a cost-utility study,"STUDY DESIGN: Randomized clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To perform a cost-utility analysis using actual cost data from a randomized clinical trial of patients over 60 years old who underwent posterolateral fusion using either rhBMP-2/ACS or iliac crest bone graft (ICBG). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Bone morphogenetic protein has been shown to be an effective bone graft substitute for spine fusion. However, a clinical trial-based economic analysis of rhBMP-2/ACS compared with iliac crest bone graft has not been done. METHODS: Patients over 60 years old requiring decompression and posterolateral fusion were randomized to rhBMP-2/ACS (n = 50) or ICBG (n = 52). A dedicated hospital coder and research nurse tracked each patient to determine direct costs of inpatient care and all postoperative healthcare encounters up to 2 years after surgery. Preoperative and 2-year-postoperative SF-6D utility scores for each patient were determined. A decision tree was created, which included the probability of complications, need for additional treatments and revision surgery; and the costs associated with initial surgery and treatment for complications and additional treatment for continued spine symptoms; and utility scores. RESULTS: The mean total 2-year cost for care (excluding complication and additional spine treatment costs) was $34,235 in the ICBG group and $36,530 in the rhBMP-2/ACS group. For the entire group, the mean cost to treat a major complication was $10,888, the cost of revision surgery for nonunion was $46,852, and additional treatment for spine-related events was $5892. In the ICBG group, 8 patients had complications; 20 had additional interventions, 5 of whom required revision for nonunion. In the rhBMP-2/ACS group, 6 patients had complications, 10 had additional interventions, and 1 required revision for nonunion. The cost of using rhBMP-2/ACS was $39,967 with a 0.11 mean improvement in SF-6D; and for ICBG the cost was $42,286 with a mean improvement of 0.10 in SF-6D. CONCLUSION: There are more complications, increased need for additional treatment and revision surgery in patients over 60 years old receiving ICBG compared with rhBMP-2/ACS. This may account for higher costs and lower improvements in utility seen in patients receiving ICBG compared with rhBMP-2/ACS in this study population.",2009-01-05263,19179918,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Leah Y Carreon,2009,34 / 3,238-43,No,19179918,"Leah Y Carreon; Steven D Glassman; Mladen Djurasovic; Mitchell J Campbell; Rolando M Puno; John R Johnson; John R Dimar; RhBMP-2 versus iliac crest bone graft for lumbar spine fusion in patients over 60 years of age: a cost-utility study, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , 2009-Feb-01; 34(3):1528-1159; 238-43",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 vs. Iliac crest bone graft (ICBG),Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2007,Not Stated
6029,Extended dalteparin prophylaxis for venous thromboembolic events: cost-utility analysis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery,"BACKGROUND: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) are manifestations of venous thromboembolic events (VTEs). Patients undergoing major surgical procedures such as total hip replacement (THR), total knee replacement (TKR), and hip fracture surgery (HFS) are at an elevated risk for VTEs. The American College of Chest Physicians' (ACCP) guidelines recommend that such patients receive thromboprophylaxis for at least 10 days. In patients undergoing THR or HFS, extended prophylaxis for up to 28-35 days is the recommended approach for those at high risk of thromboembolic events. The NAFT (North American Fragmin Trial) compared the prophylactic efficacy of dalteparin with that of warfarin during the in-hospital period, and with that of placebo during the period of hospital discharge until day 35 postsurgery, in patients who underwent total hip arthroplasty. During both the in-hospital and the postdischarge time periods, dalteparin significantly reduced the occurrence of DVT. Given the clinical relevance of these results, the low specificity of the ACCP recommendations regarding optimal prophylaxis duration, and the importance of optimizing the efficiency of DVT prophylaxis in the practice setting, a cost-utility analysis was conducted comparing dalteparin 10-day and 35-day (extended) with a warfarin 10-day protocol, in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgeries such as THR, TKR, or HFS. DESIGN AND SETTING: A three-arm decision model was developed using the prevalence of symptomatic DVT from NAFT publications, epidemiologic studies, and published meta-analyses. Healthcare resource use was abstracted from a survey of clinicians and from the economic literature. Utility estimates were obtained by interviewing a sample of 24 people from the general public using the time trade-off technique. The clinical, economic and utility data were then used to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained with dalteparin for 10 or 35 days relative to 10 days of warfarin. STUDY PERSPECTIVE: Canadian provincial healthcare system. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: The cost per QALY gained with 10 days of dalteparin was below $Can1000 for all the surgeries evaluated (all costs are reported in 2007 Canadian dollars [$Can1 = $US1, as of December 2007]). In the case of extended prophylaxis, the incremental cost per QALY gained with 35 days of dalteparin over warfarin was $Can40 100, $Can46 500, and $Can31 200 for patients undergoing THR, TKR, and HFS, respectively. Reducing the duration of prophylaxis from 35 to 28 days generated ratios that were below $Can35 000 for all three surgeries evaluated. Conclusion: Ten days of dalteparin following major orthopedic surgery is a clinically and economically attractive alternative to warfarin for DVT prophylaxis. In the case of the 35-day dalteparin protocol, the results also indicated acceptable economic value to a publicly funded healthcare system, particularly in the settings of HFS and THR.

In addition, reducing the duration of prophylaxis to 28 days postsurgery would be associated with a more favorable return on public healthcare expenditures.",2009-01-05265,19178131,Am J Cardiovasc Drugs,George Dranitsaris,2009,9 / 1,45-58,No,19178131,"George Dranitsaris; Carmine Stumpo; Reginald Smith; William Bartle; Extended dalteparin prophylaxis for venous thromboembolic events: cost-utility analysis in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, Am J Cardiovasc Drugs, 2009; 9(1):1175-3277; 45-58",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Dalteparin 35 day vs. Warfarin 10-day protocol (with INR target between 2 and 3),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,31200,Canada,2007,36450.48
6035,Cost effectiveness of high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support as initial treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,"The GOELAMS 072 study showed that first-line high-dose chemotherapy (HDT) with peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) support was superior to the standard chemotherapy regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone; CHOP) in adults with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic profile of HDT with PBSCT support relative to standard CHOP therapy as first-line treatment in adults with aggressive NHL. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis from the French Public Health Insurance perspective, restricted to hospital costs (euro, year 2008 values). The clinical effectiveness criterion was censured overall survival (OS) difference after a median follow-up of 4 years for the entire cohort. A total of 197 patients were included (CHOP, n = 99; HDT, n = 98). Uncertainty was assessed using non-parametric bootstrap simulations and various scenario analyses. Five-year OS did not differ significantly between groups for the entire cohort. Nevertheless, subgroup analyses appeared to be more relevant for decision making: among patients with a high-intermediate risk according to the age-adjusted International Prognostic Index (IPI), HDT yielded a significantly higher 5-year OS than CHOP (74% vs 44%; p = 0.001). Among these patients, the mean censured OS survival, adjusted for time discounting and quality of life (QOL), increased with HDT by 1.20 years (95% CI 1.19, 1.21). The cost per life-year saved with HDT was estimated as euro34 315 (95% CI 32 683, 35 947) in this subgroup. Results suggested that HDT with PBSCT support might be considered a cost-effective strategy among patients with high-intermediate-risk NHL according to the age-adjusted IPI.

6036,Statin therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: a cost-effectiveness and value-of-information analysis,"HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are potentially excellent candidate agents for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). They reduce both cardiovascular risks and RA disease activity. To evaluate the potential long-term effects of statin therapy among patients with RA, and to determine their associated cost effectiveness by incorporating both the cardiovascular and the anti-rheumatic benefits. A Markov decision-analytic model was developed to simulate cardiovascular and RA disease profiles over time. The impact of statin therapy was estimated by adjusting the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events and changes in the RA Disease Activity Score (DAS28), based on the results of a randomized trial. The benefits (QALYs) and costs (in year 2005 values) were evaluated from a US payer perspective. A full uncertainty analysis, including a value-of-information (VOI) analysis, was undertaken to evaluate the importance of individual parameters. Using a 10-year time horizon, the additional cost and QALYs of statin therapy were estimated to be USD4690 and 0.44 QALYs, respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD10 650 per QALY (95% CI 1525, 156 565). The QALY gain associated with statin therapy depended more on the anti-rheumatic effects of statin therapy than on its cardiovascular prevention effect. The VOI analysis found the long-term benefit of statin therapy (i.e. >or=12 months) and the consequent impact on quality of life to be the most uncertain and, therefore, influential parameters. Our analysis indicates that the dual anti-inflammatory/cardiovascular benefits of statins could make this therapy highly cost effective in RA.

6039,The costs and benefits of automatic estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) has increased over the past two decades. The sensitivity of serum creatinine (sCr) to identify CKD is low. As a result, many healthcare centers report estimated GFR (eGFR) with routine blood work. The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of automatic eGFR reporting compared with reporting sCr alone. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A Markov model was designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of reporting eGFR compared with reporting sCr alone in a hypothetical cohort of 60-yr-old individuals undergoing annual blood chemistry testing over 18 yr. Paths and path probabilities were identical between the two arms, except for the sensitivity and specificity of eGFR and sCr to detect CKD. RESULTS: eGFR reporting was dominant with a cost/effectiveness ratio of $16,751/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) versus $16,779/QALY for sCr reporting. Monte Carlo microsimulations in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients demonstrated that over 18 yr, an average of 13 fewer deaths, 29 fewer ESRD events, and 11,348 more false positive CKD (FP-CKD) cases occurred with eGFR reporting. A sensitivity analysis revealed that decreasing the FP-CKD quality of life by > 2% rendered sCr reporting more cost-effective than eGFR reporting. If FP-CKD reduced quality of life by 5%, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for sCr reporting versus eGFR reporting would be $4367/QALY. CONCLUSION: A decision analysis suggests that reporting eGFR may be beneficial, but this limited benefit was reversed with virtually any reduction in quality of life caused by incorrect diagnosis of CKD.",2009-01-05269,19176794,Clin J Am Soc Nephrol,Julia R den Hartog,2009,4 / 2,419-27,No,19176794,"Julia R den Hartog; Peter P Reese; Borut Cizman; Harold I Feldman; The costs and benefits of automatic estimated glomerular filtration rate reporting, Clin J Am Soc Nephrol, 2009-Feb; 4(2):1555-905X; 419-27",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Automatic estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting vs. Serum creatinine reporting,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,18 Years,3.00,3.00,-15500,United States,2005,-20540.56
6040,Is centralization of ovarian cancer care warranted? A cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of tertiary referral care for ovarian cancer patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: We collected clinical and registry data on 1077 newly diagnosed ovarian cancer patients treated from 1996-2003 in a random sample of Dutch hospitals. Decision modelling was used to compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment in general hospitals, semi-specialized hospitals, and tertiary care centers.

Long-term outcomes in terms of costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental costs per QALY gained were estimated. To assess uncertainty, multivariable sensitivity analyses and scenario analyses were performed. RESULTS: Treatment of ovarian cancer patients in semi-specialized hospitals costs on average euro882 more than in general hospitals (95% confidence interval -720 to 2462) and yields 0.12 additional QALYs (95% CI 0.02 to 0.22), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro7135.

METHODS: The published literature provided evidence on the effectiveness of the comparator interventions in the absence of primary outcomes data. Costs of care were derived from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services fee schedules. A Markov model was constructed from the payer perspective to simulate the outcomes of patients undergoing nonchemotherapeutic interventions for metastatic spinal tumors. Because cancer therapies bear significant health and economic consequences, the impact of treatment-related toxicities was integrated into the model. Given the terminal nature of these conditions and the limited life expectancy of the patient population, the time horizon for the analysis was limited to 12 months. RESULTS: Patients treated with CyberKnife SRS gained an additional net health benefit of 0.08 quality-adjusted life year; the calculated cost of CyberKnife SRS was $1933 less than external beam radiation therapy for comparable effectiveness. The incremental cost per benefit for this strategy ($41 500 per quality-adjusted life year) met payers' willingness-to-pay criteria.

6043,Cost-effectiveness of interferon gamma release assays vs tuberculin skin tests in health care workers,"BACKGROUND: Interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) offer alternatives to tuberculin skin tests (TSTs) for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Unlike TSTs, IGRAs require only a single patient visit and are not affected by prior BCG vaccination, providing greater specificity. Of 2 Food and Drug Administration-approved IGRAs, the newer QuantiFERON-TB Gold in Tube test (QFT-GIT) requires less manual processing time than the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT-G). We compared the cost-effectiveness of the QFT-G, QFT-GIT, and TST for detecting LTBI in new health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: A Markov state-transition decision analytic model using the societal perspective and lifetime horizon was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with the 3 strategies for hypothetical 35-year-old HCWs with or without prior BCG vaccination. Direct and indirect costs and probabilities were based on manufacturer data, national Veterans Health Administration records, and the published literature. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: Both IGRAs were more effective and less costly than the TST, whether or not the HCW had been vaccinated with BCG previously. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the QFT-G compared with the QFT-GIT was $14,092/QALY for non-BCG-vaccinated HCWs and $103,047/QALY for BCG-vaccinated HCWs. There was no prevalence of LTBI at which the TST became the most effective or least costly strategy. If the sensitivity of the QFT-GIT exceeds that of the QFT-G, then the QFT-GIT is the most effective and least costly strategy.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study builds on a within-trial cost-efficacy analysis. The analysis compares the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) between the two intervention groups. Intervention costs were extrapolated based on observed resource utilization during the trial. The proportion of patients in each intervention group with remission of diabetes at 2 years was the same as that observed in the trial. Health care costs for patients with type 2 diabetes and outcome variables required to derive estimates of QALYs were sourced from published literature. A health care system perspective was adopted. Costs and outcomes were discounted annually at 3%. Costs are presented in 2006 Australian dollars (AUD) (currency exchange: 1 AUD = 0.74 USD). RESULTS: The mean number of years in diabetes remission over a lifetime was 11.4 for surgical therapy patients and 2.1 for conventional therapy patients. Over the remainder of their lifetime, surgical and conventional therapy patients lived 15.7 and 14.5 discounted QALYs, respectively. The mean discounted lifetime costs were 98,900 AUD per surgical therapy patient and 101,400 AUD per conventional therapy patient. Relative to conventional therapy, surgically induced weight loss was associated with a mean health care saving of 2,400 AUD and 1.2 additional QALYs per patient.

An epidemiological 25 years-long model-based cost-utility analysis was performed following the Italian National Health Service (INHS) and societal perspectives to compare costs and quality-adjusted life years of treatment with Interferon beta-1b (IFNB-1b) from diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) versus treating at subsequent conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS). Among patients treated (untreated) with IFNB-1b from CIS diagnosis, 40,420 (43,700) converted to CDMS after 25 years; the estimated cumulative probability of converting to CDMS during the first 3 years was 72.90% (84.94%) (P < 0.0001). Early treatment with IFNB-1b is highly cost-effective for the INHS (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio: Euros 2,574.94) and dominant from the societal viewpoint.

6048,Cost-effectiveness analysis of docetaxel (Taxotere) vs. 5-fluorouracil in combined therapy in the initial phases of breast cancer,"INTRODUCTION: The randomised controlled trial BCIRG001 has recently demonstrated that docetaxel in combination with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (TAC) has better efficacy than the standard treatment (FAC, i.e., 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) in the adjuvant treatment of patients with node-positive breast cancer. The cost-effectiveness of TAC vs. FAC in the Spanish setting is analysed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical outcomes from trial BCIRG001 were combined with Spanish costs and longterm efficacy of FAC and TAC extrapolated up to 5 years by means of a Markov model. Results are shown as cost per life year gained (C/LYG) and cost per quality-adjusted life year (C/QALY). Costs and effects were discounted at a rate of 3%. RESULTS: Mean survival was 17.8 and 16.5 years for TAC and FAC, with total costs of euro14,611 and euro11,586, respectively. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that TAC achieves a C/LYG and a C/QALY of only euro2345 and euro2631, respectively. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results.

6049,Cost-effectiveness of using pharmacogenetic information in warfarin dosing for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: Variants in genes involved in warfarin metabolism and sensitivity affect individual warfarin requirements and the risk for bleeding. Testing for these variant alleles might allow more personalized dosing of warfarin during the induction phase. In 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration changed the labeling for warfarin (Coumadin, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, New Jersey), suggesting that clinicians consider genetic testing before initiating therapy. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of genotype-guided dosing versus standard induction of warfarin therapy for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. DESIGN: Markov state transition decision model. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from relevant articles of literature published in English. TARGET POPULATION: Outpatients or inpatients requiring initiation of warfarin therapy. The base case was a man age 69 years with newly diagnosed nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and no contraindications to warfarin therapy. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTION: Genotype-guided dosing consisting of genotyping for CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, and/or VKORC1 versus standard warfarin induction. OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs were in 2007 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: In the base case, genotype-guided dosing resulted in better outcomes, but at a relatively high cost. Overall, the marginal cost-effectiveness of testing exceeded $170 000 per QALY. On the basis of current data and cost of testing (about $400), there is only a 10% chance that genotype-guided dosing is likely to be cost-effective (that is, <$50 000 per QALY). Sensitivity analyses revealed that for genetic testing to cost less than $50 000 per QALY, it would have to be restricted to patients at high risk for hemorrhage or meet the following optimistic criteria: prevent greater than 32% of major bleeding events, be available within 24 hours, and cost less than $200. LIMITATION: Few published studies describe the effect of genotype-guided dosing on major bleeding events, and although these studies show a trend toward decreased bleeding, the results are not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Warfarin-related genotyping is unlikely to be cost-effective for typical patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, but may be cost-effective in patients at high risk for hemorrhage who are starting warfarin therapy.",2009-01-05296,19153410,Ann Intern Med,Mark H Eckman,2009,150 / 2,73-83,No,19153410,"Mark H Eckman; Jonathan Rosand; Steven M Greenberg; Brian F Gage; Cost-effectiveness of using pharmacogenetic information in warfarin dosing for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, Ann Intern Med, 2009-Jan-20; 150(2):1539-3704; 73-83",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Testing for variant alleles involved in warfarin metabolism to allow for more personalized dosing of warfarin during induction phase vs. No genotyping for warfarin-related variant alleles and using standard warfarin induction,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,171750,United States,2007,214383.91

6052,Long-term cost-effectiveness of disease management in systolic heart failure,"BACKGROUND: Although congestive heart failure (CHF) is a primary target for disease management programs, previous studies have generated mixed results regarding the effectiveness and cost savings of disease management when applied to CHF. OBJECTIVE: We estimated the long-term impact of systolic heart failure disease management from the results of an 18-month clinical trial. METHODS: We used data generated from the trial (starting population distributions, resource utilization, mortality rates, and transition probabilities) in a Markov model to project results of continuing the disease management program for the patients' lifetimes. Outputs included distribution of illness severity, mortality, resource consumption, and the cost of resources consumed. Both cost and effectiveness were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. Cost-effectiveness was computed as cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Model results were validated against trial data and indicated that, over their lifetimes, patients experienced a lifespan extension of 51 days. Combined discounted lifetime program and medical costs were $4850 higher in the disease management group than the control group, but the program had a favorable long-term discounted cost-effectiveness of $43,650/QALY. These results are robust to assumptions regarding mortality rates, the impact of aging on the cost of care, the discount rate, utility values, and the targeted population. CONCLUSIONS: Estimation of the clinical benefits and financial burden of disease management can be enhanced by model-based analyses to project costs and effectiveness.

A Markov cohort simulation was used to follow the clinical course of typical patients with MBC. Information on response rates and major adverse effects was derived, and transition probabilities were estimated, based on the results of the E2100 clinical trial. Direct costs were assessed from the perspective of the Swiss health system. The addition of bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel is estimated to cost an additional 40,369euro and to yield a gain of 0.22 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 189,427euro/QALY gained.

6054,Cost-effectiveness of MRI compared to mammography for breast cancer screening in a high risk population,"BACKGROUND: Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive method of breast imaging virtually uninfluenced by breast density. Because of the improved sensitivity, breast MRI is increasingly being used for detection of breast cancer among high risk young women. However, the specificity of breast MRI is variable and costs are high. The purpose of this study was to determine if breast MRI is a cost-effective approach for the detection of breast cancer among young women at high risk. METHODS: A Markov model was created to compare annual breast cancer screening over 25 years with either breast MRI or mammography among young women at high risk. Data from published studies provided probabilities for the model including sensitivity and specificity of each screening strategy. Costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates for hospital and physician services while medication costs were obtained from the Federal Supply Scale. Utilities from the literature were applied to each health outcome in the model including a disutility for the temporary health state following breast biopsy for a false positive test result. All costs and benefits were discounted at 5% per year. The analysis was performed from the payer perspective with results reported in 2006 U.S. dollars. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses addressed uncertainty in all model parameters. RESULTS: Breast MRI provided 14.1 discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at a discounted cost of $18,167 while mammography provided 14.0 QALYs at a cost of $4,760 over 25 years of screening. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of breast MRI compared to mammography was $179,599/QALY. In univariate analysis, breast MRI screening became < $50,000/QALY when the cost of the MRI was < $315. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, MRI screening produced a net health benefit of -0.202 QALYs (95% central range: -0.767 QALYs to +0.439 QALYs) compared to mammography at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY. Breast MRI screening was superior in 0%, < $50,000/QALY in 22%, > $50,000/QALY in 34%, and inferior in 44% of trials. CONCLUSION: Although breast MRI may provide health benefits when compared to mammographic screening for some high risk women, it does not appear to be cost-effective even at willingness to pay thresholds above $120,000/QALY.",2009-01-05304,19144138,BMC Health Serv Res,Susan G Moore,2009,9 /,9,Yes,19144138,"Susan G Moore; Pareen J Shenoy; Laura Fanucchi; John W Tumeh; Christopher R Flowers; Cost-effectiveness of MRI compared to mammography for breast cancer screening in a high risk population, BMC Health Serv Res, 2009; 9():1472-6963; 9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) screening for malignant breast tumors vs. Mammography screening for malignant breast tumors,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,25 Years,5.00,5.00,134070,United States,2006,172117.02
6055,Osteoporosis case manager for patients with hip fractures: results of a cost-effectiveness analysis conducted alongside a randomized trial,"BACKGROUND: In a randomized trial of patients with hip fractures, we previously demonstrated that a hospital-based case manager could increase rates of appropriate osteoporosis treatment to 51% compared with 22% for usual care (P < .001). Alongside that trial, we conducted an economic analysis. METHODS: Patients with hip fractures were randomized to usual care (n = 110) or a case manager (n = 110) and followed up for 1 year. Time-motion studies were used to determine intervention costs. From a third-party health care payer perspective and over the patient's remaining lifetime, a Markov decision-analytic model was constructed to determine cost-effectiveness of the intervention compared with usual care. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% and expressed in 2006 Canadian dollars. RESULTS: The intervention cost CaD $56 per patient. Compared with usual care, the intervention strategy was dominant: for every 100 patients case managed, 6 fractures (4 hip fractures) were prevented, 4 quality-adjusted life-years were gained, and CaD $260 000 was saved by the health care system. Irrespective of the number of patients case managed, the intervention reached a break-even threshold within 2 years. The intervention dominated usual care over the entire spectrum of 1-way sensitivity analyses and was cost-saving in 82% of probabilistic model simulations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with usual care, we found that using a case manager for patients with hip fractures increased rates of appropriate osteoporosis treatment. The intervention dominated usual care, and the analysis suggests that systems implementing an intervention similar to ours should expect to see a reduction in fractures, gains in life expectancy, and substantial cost savings.

6060,Cost-utility analysis for advanced breast cancer therapy in Germany: results of the fulvestrant sequencing model,"Therapy decisions in advanced breast cancer (ABC) increasingly require assessment not only of treatment efficacy but also of cost-effectiveness. To this end, we performed a cost-utility analysis by comparing treatment sequences including/omitting fulvestrant in a hypothetical population of hormone receptor-positive (HR+) postmenopausal women with ABC. The analysis was performed from the German health care perspective. Using a first-order sequential Markov model, expected costs and utilities were calculated over a time horizon of 10 years for cohorts of patients with HR+ ABC, previously treated for at least 5 years using adjuvant endocrine therapies. Utilities were primarily quantified in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALY). ""Base-case"" estimates of state transition rates, resource utilization, and other model parameters were derived from published evidence and expert assessment. The impacts of uncertainties in all key model parameters were evaluated by sensitivity analysis. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% annually. Including second-line fulvestrant in the treatment sequence led to greater estimated health gains (0.021 QALY) and cost savings of <euro>564 ($745, pound380) per patient, i.e. the fulvestrant-containing sequence was ""dominant"". The prediction of a cost savings was robust with respect to variations in all key parameters. The probability of acceptable cost-effectiveness for the fulvestrant sequence was 72% at a willingness to pay (WTP) of <euro>30,000/QALY ($39,621/QALY, pound20,198/QALY); the probability was even higher at lower WTP and substantially exceeded 50% for any realistic WTP. In a representative population of women with HR+ advanced breast cancer, inclusion of fulvestrant in the treatment sequence provides a cost-effective alternative from the German health care perspective. A high probability of cost-effectiveness is maintained under variations in all key parameters. The results reflect a tendency for patients receiving fulvestrant at an early stage to maintain high quality of life for a longer interval.",2009-01-05319,19130218,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Michael Lux,2009,/,,No,19130218,"Michael Lux; M Hartmann; C Jackisch; G Raab; A Schneeweiß; K Possinger; J Oyee; N Harbeck; Michael Patrick Lux; M Hartmann; C Jackisch; G Raab; A Schneeweiss; K Possinger; J Oyee; N Harbeck; Cost-utility analysis for advanced breast cancer therapy in Germany: results of the fulvestrant sequencing model, Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2009-Jan-08; ():0167-6806",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fulvestrant as an adjuvant therapy for advanced breast cancer vs. Usual care chemotherapy to treat advanced breast cancer,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-26857.14,Euro,2007,-45963.45
6061,Lung cancer deaths from indoor radon and the cost effectiveness and potential of policies to reduce them,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the number of deaths from lung cancer related to radon in the home and to explore the cost effectiveness of alternative policies to control indoor radon and their potential to reduce lung cancer mortality. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis. SETTING: United Kingdom. DATA SOURCES: Epidemiological data on risks from indoor radon and from smoking, vital statistics on deaths from lung cancer, survey information on effectiveness and costs of radon prevention and remediation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Estimated number of deaths from lung cancer related to indoor radon, lifetime risks of death from lung cancer before and after various potential interventions to control radon, the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained from different policies for control of radon, and the potential of those policies to reduce lung cancer mortality. RESULTS: The mean radon concentration in UK homes is 21 becquerels per cubic metre (Bq/m(3)). Each year around 1100 deaths from lung cancer (3.3% of all deaths from lung cancer) are related to radon in the home. Over 85% of these arise from radon concentrations below 100 Bq/m(3) and most are caused jointly by radon and active smoking. Current policy requiring basic measures to prevent radon in new homes in selected areas is highly cost effective, and such measures would remain cost effective if extended to the entire UK, with a cost per QALY gained of pound11,400 ( euro12 200; $16,913). Current policy identifying and remediating existing homes with high radon levels is, however, neither cost effective (cost per QALY gained pound36,800) nor effective in reducing lung cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Policies requiring basic preventive measures against radon in all new homes throughout the UK would be cost effective and could complement existing policies to reduce smoking.

6066,An economic analysis of continuous positive airway pressure for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome,"OBJECTIVES: An important option for the medical treatment of obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep. This study reports on the cost-effectiveness of CPAP compared with dental devices and lifestyle advice. The work was commissioned by the NHS HTA Programme to inform the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) appraisal of CPAP. METHODS: A Markov model compared the interventions over the expected patient lifetime. The primary measure of cost-effectiveness was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. The QALY incorporated the impact of treatments on daytime sleepiness, blood pressure and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). RESULTS: On average, CPAP was associated with higher costs and QALYs compared with dental devices or lifestyle advice. In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for CPAP compared with dental devices was around 4,000 pounds per QALY (2005--06 prices). The probability that CPAP is more cost-effective than dental devices or lifestyle advice at a threshold value of 20,000 pounds per QALY was 0.78 for men and 0.80 for women. Several sensitivity analyses were undertaken and it was found that the ICER for CPAP consistently fell below 20,000 pounds per QALY gained, apart from in a subgroup with mild disease.

6070,Cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance guided focused ultrasound for the treatment of uterine fibroids,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Magnetic Resonance Guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS) compared with alternative treatments for uterine fibroids in the United States. METHODS: We used techniques of decision analysis and data from secondary sources to develop and estimate an economic model of the management of uterine fibroids among premenopausal women. Patients in the model receive treatment with MRgFUS, uterine artery embolization (UAE), abdominal myomectomy, hysterectomy, or pharmacotherapy. The model predicts total costs (including subsequent procedures) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each treatment strategy over a lifetime horizon, discounted at 3 percent, from a societal perspective. Data on treatment efficacy and safety were obtained from published and unpublished studies. Costs (2005 US$) were obtained from an analysis of a large administrative database and other secondary sources. Lost productivity costs were included in the base-case analysis, but excluded in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: UAE was associated with the most QALYs (17.39), followed by MRgFUS (17.36), myomectomy (17.31), hysterectomy (17.18), and pharmacotherapy (16.70). Pharmacotherapy was the least costly strategy ($9,200 per patient), followed by hysterectomy ($19,800), MRgFUS ($27,300), UAE ($28,900), and myomectomy ($35,100). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (cost per QALY gained) were $21,800 for hysterectomy, $41,400 for MRgFUS, and $54,200 for UAE; myomectomy was more costly and less effective than both MRgFUS and UAE. Results were sensitive to MRgFUS recurrence rates, MRgFUS procedure costs, and assumptions about quality of life following hysterectomy.

6074,Cost-effectiveness analysis of lapatinib in HER-2-positive advanced breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: A recent clinical trial demonstrated that the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine in the treatment of HER-2-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC) significantly increases median time to progression. The objective of the current analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of this therapy from the US societal perspective. METHODS: A Markov model comprising 4 health states (stable disease, respond-to-therapy, disease progression, and death) was developed to estimate the projected-lifetime clinical and economic implications of this therapy. The model used Monte Carlo simulation to imitate the clinical course of a typical patient with ABC and updated with response rates and major adverse effects. Transition probabilities were estimated based on the results from the EGF100151 and EGF20002 clinical trials of lapatinib. Health state utilities, direct and indirect costs of the therapy, major adverse events, laboratory tests, and costs of disease progression were obtained from published sources. The model used a 3% discount rate and reported in 2007 US dollars. RESULTS: Over a lifetime, the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine as combination therapy was estimated to cost an additional $19,630, with an expected gain of 0.12 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) or an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $166,113 per QALY gained. The 95% confidence limits of the ICER ranged from $158,000 to $215,000/QALY. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve indicated less than 1% probability that the ICER would be lower than $100,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with commonly accepted willingness-to-pay thresholds in oncology treatment, the addition of lapatinib to capecitabine is not clearly cost-effective; and most likely to result in an ICER somewhat higher than the societal willingness-to-pay threshold limits.",2009-01-05331,19117341,Cancer,Quang A Le,2009,115 / 3,489-98,No,19117341,"Quang A Le; Joel W Hay; Cost-effectiveness analysis of lapatinib in HER-2-positive advanced breast cancer, Cancer, 2009-Feb-01; 115(3):0008-543X; 489-98",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lapatinib + Capecitabine (150-mg capecitabine tablet Capecitabine + 250-mg lapatinib tablet) vs. Capecitabine (150-mg tablet),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,163583.34,United States,2007,204190.03
6075,The cost-effectiveness of hormone therapy in younger and older postmenopausal women,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the health and economic outcomes of hormone therapy in younger and older postmenopausal women. METHODS: We developed a cost-effectiveness model to evaluate outcomes associated with hormone therapy in younger and older postmenopausal women, using data sources from published literature through March 2008. The target population was 50-year-old and 65-year-old women given hormone therapy or no therapy, and then followed over their lifetime. Primary outcomes measured were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: For the base-case analysis, hormone therapy for 15 years in the younger cohort resulted in a gain of 1.49 QALYs with an incremental cost of $2438 per QALY gained, compared with no therapy. The results for younger women were robust to all sensitivity analyses, and treatment remained highly cost-effective (<$10,000 per QALY gained) within the range of individual assumptions used. Treatment durations of 5 years and 30 years also were highly cost-effective. In the older cohort, treatment for 15 years resulted in a net gain of 0.11 QALYs with a cost of $27,953 per QALY gained. However, a loss of QALYs was seen in the first 9 years. The results for older women were sensitive to many of the assumptions used.

6081,The cost-utility analysis of 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: 18-Fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is effective but costly in the early detection of recurrence for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in patients after treatment. In this study, we developed a decision tree model to analyze the cost utility of 18F-FDG PET in detecting loco-regional recurrences for NPC patients after therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis for cost utility is based on the decision-tree model for three different strategies: 1) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-only, 2) PET-only, and 3) MRI-PET (performing PET if MRI result is uncertain). Sensitivity analyses have been performed to examine changes in the cost ratio of PET/MRI and the probability of uncertain MRI. RESULTS: After inputting the data for utilities and life expectancies into the decision tree model, the quality-adjusted life expectancies turn out to be 16.16 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for strategy 1, 16.70 QALYs for strategy 2, and 17.35 QALYs for strategy 3. The additional cost per additional QALYs for strategy 3 relative to strategy 1 is calculated to be US $462. Strategy 3 dominates over strategy 2 because strategy 3 costs less and yields more QALYs than strategy 2. If the cost ratio of PET/MRI is less than 1.85 or the probability of uncertain MRI is greater than 73%, then the PET-only strategy becomes more cost-effective than the MRI-PET strategy. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that the MRI-PET strategy is the most cost-effective for now. It is likely the PET-only strategy will become the most cost-effective for recurrent NPC in patients in the near future as the cost of PET has decreased in a faster rate than the cost of MRI.",2009-01-05352,19064212,Acad Radiol,Ruoh-Fang Yen,2009,16 / 1,54-60,No,19064212,"Ruoh-Fang Yen; Ming-Fang Yen; Ruey-Long Hong; Kai-Yuan Tzen; Chun-Ru Chien; Tony Hsiu-Hsi Chen; The cost-utility analysis of 18-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Acad Radiol, 2009-Jan; 16(1):1076-6332; 54-60",QALY,Taiwan,Not Stated,Not Stated,18-Fluoro-2-Deoxyglucose Positron emission tomography (PET scan) of the nasal passages vs. Magnetic resonance imaging of the nasal passages,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,1389,United States,2007,1733.79

For this purpose, we developed a simulation model that describes the relation between each of the high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) types and cervical disease, allowing the occurrence of multiple type-specific infections. Model parameters were derived from Dutch cohort studies, including a large population-based screening trial, and from the national cervical cancer registry. The model satisfactorily reproduced Dutch data on HPV infection and the presence of cervical lesions. For our base-case scenario in which 85% of the girls aged 12 years were vaccinated against types 16/18 (95% efficacy, lifelong protection), the model predicted a decrease of 60% in the number of cervical cancer cases and cervical cancer deaths indicating that substantial health benefits can be achieved. Health savings were robust against changes in the vaccine efficacy (varied from 85% to 98%) but savings showed a substantial reduction when the efficacy started waning 10 years after vaccination. The discounted costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were euro 19,500/QALY (range euro 11,000 to euro 25,000/QALY) and lied near the cost-effectiveness threshold of euro 20,000/QALY used in The Netherlands.

Model parameters were derived from Dutch cohort studies, including a large population-based screening trial, and from the national cervical cancer registry. The model satisfactorily reproduced Dutch data on HPV infection and the presence of cervical lesions. For our base-case scenario in which 85% of the girls aged 12 years were vaccinated against types 16/18 (95% efficacy, lifelong protection), the model predicted a decrease of 60% in the number of cervical cancer cases and cervical cancer deaths indicating that substantial health benefits can be achieved. Health savings were robust against changes in the vaccine efficacy (varied from 85% to 98%) but savings showed a substantial reduction when the efficacy started waning 10 years after vaccination. The discounted costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were euro 19,500/QALY (range euro 11,000 to euro 25,000/QALY) and lied near the cost-effectiveness threshold of euro 20,000/QALY used in The Netherlands. The simulations further showed that vaccination cannot replace screening because vaccination without screening was less effective than screening in preventing cancer in women over 40 years of age. In conclusion, our model results support the implementation of HPV16/18 vaccination in young women in addition to cervical cancer screening.",2009-01-05357,19035448,Int J Cancer,Veerle M H Coupé,2009,124 / 4,970-8,No,19035448,"Veerle M H Coupé; Joost van Ginkel; Hester E de Melker; Peter J F Snijders; Chris J L M Meijer; Johannes Berkhof; HPV16/18 vaccination to prevent cervical cancer in The Netherlands: model-based cost-effectiveness, Int J Cancer, 2009-Feb-15; 124(4):0020-7136; 970-8",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Polyvalent (type-16/18) vaccination against HPV among 12-year olds (assuming 85% efficacy, 85% coverage, lifetime protection), with screening vs. Screening only for cervical cancer, followed by usual care if positively diagnosed",Not Stated,100 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,88 Years,4.00,1.50,22337,Euro,2006,36025.33
6097,Cost-effectiveness of sequential therapy with tumor necrosis factor antagonists in early rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the comparative lifetime cost-effectiveness of sequenced therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists as the initial therapeutic intervention for patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Because patients with RA switch regimens many times throughout the course of disease, sequenced therapeutic interventions were modeled, continuing until the last effective agent failed or death occurred. The model used published clinical outcomes from short-term, randomized controlled trials. Direct treatment costs and costs of lost productivity were modeled for each of 5 alternative treatment sequences. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are expressed as quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Treatment sequences that included TNF antagonists produced a greater number of QALY than conventional disease modifying antirheumatic drug regimens alone. The cost-effectiveness of sequenced therapy initiated with adalimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) extendedly dominated both infliximab-plus-MTX-initiated and etanercept sequences. The cost of adalimumab plus MTX per QALY was US $47,157 excluding productivity losses, and $19,663 including productivity losses. A supplementary sequence that incorporated adalimumab-plus-MTX-initiated first-line therapy followed by another TNF antagonist as second-line therapy was modeled; this sequence resulted in additional QALY gained and extendedly dominated all single-TNF strategies. CONCLUSION: Of the 3 single-TNF antagonist sequences, the adalimumab-plus-MTX-initiated sequence was cost-effective in producing the greatest number of QALY. Multiple TNF strategies, such as the supplementary sequence modeled in this analysis, may be cost-effective in producing even greater health gain.",2009-01-05360,19012363,J Rheumatol,Andrew Davies,2009,36 / 1,16-26,No,19012363,"Andrew Davies; Mary A Cifaldi; Oscar G Segurado; Michael H Weisman; Cost-effectiveness of sequential therapy with tumor necrosis factor antagonists in early rheumatoid arthritis, J Rheumatol, 2009-Jan; 36(1):0315-162X; 16-26",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Regimented Treatments:1) adalimumab + methotrexate --> 2) methotrexate + hydroxychloroquine -->3) Leflunomide --> 4) Gold --> 5) Palliative care vs. Regimented Treatment: 1) methotrexate --> 2) methotrexate + hydroxychloroquine --> 3) Leflunomide --> 4) Gold --> 5) Palliative Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,23377,United States,2007,29179.93

6099,"Cost-effectiveness of latanoprost and timolol maleate for the treatment of glaucoma in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, using a decision-analytic health economic model","PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of latanoprost or timolol in glaucoma treatment in Norway, Sweden, Denmark (Scandinavia) and the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. Health states were 'stable' and 'progressed' glaucoma, and transition probabilities for both primary open-angle and exfoliation glaucoma were derived from the medical literature. Practice patterns were obtained from surveys completed by 54 ophthalmologists geographically dispersed throughout each country. Country specific unit costs were used for medications, patient visits, diagnostics, and therapeutic procedures. RESULTS: Over the life of the model latanoprost was less expensive than timolol by 5.3-7.6% (Scandinavia) and 2.1% (UK). Following adjustments, therapy in the original timolol-treated cohort was slightly more effective in each country with a difference in 0.003-0.015 years to progression of glaucoma existing between latanoprost. This may have resulted from the model design, which reflected that physicians ultimately control most patients' glaucoma over 5 years by adding or changing therapy. The associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for latanoprost vs timolol generated by the Scandinavian and the UK models, respectively, were: Norway 351,396 NOK; Sweden 988,985 SEK; Denmark 351,641; and the UK 4751 GBP.
