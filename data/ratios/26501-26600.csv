26501,Cost-effectiveness of free HIV voluntary counseling and testing through a community-based AIDS service organization in Northern Tanzania,"OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of fee-based and free testing strategies at an HIV voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) program integrated into a community-based AIDS service organization in Moshi, Tanzania. METHODS: We waived the usual fee schedule during a 2-week free, advertised VCT campaign; analyzed the number of clients testing per day during prefree, free, and postfree testing periods; and estimated the cost-effectiveness of limited and sustained free testing strategies. RESULTS: The number of clients testing per day increased from 4.1 during the prefree testing interval to 15.0 during the free testing campaign (P<.0001) and remained significantly increased at 7.1 (P<.0001) after resumption of the standard fees. HIV seroprevalence (16.7%) and risk behaviors were unchanged over these intervals. Modeled over 1 year, the costs per infection averted with the standard fee schedule, with a 2-week free VCT campaign, and with sustained free VCT year-round were $170, $105, and $92, respectively, and the costs per disability-adjusted life year gained were $8.72, $5.40, and $4.72, respectively.

26504,"A cost-effectiveness analysis of strategies for controlling Japanese encephalitis in Andhra Pradesh, India","To evaluate the potential use of vaccines against Japanese encephalitis (JE) and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of mass vaccination campaigns and routine vaccination of children in 16 districts of Andhra Pradesh, India, with inactivated vaccine and live attenuated vaccine (SA 14-14-2), a decision analytic model was constructed. Vaccination would potentially reduce the burden of JE by 29%-76%. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) of campaign immunization alone would be slightly more favorable than that of a combination strategy of immunization campaign plus routine immunization. However, reduction of disease and economic burden through campaign and routine immunization is greater than through campaign alone. As evidenced by this model, immunization with SA 14-14-2 is associated with a lower disease burden and better cost-effectiveness ratios than with inactivated vaccine and costs US$58 per DALY for a one-time campaign and US$76 per DALY for a one-time campaign plus a 5-year routine immunization program.

26513,Cost-utility analysis of a national project to reduce hypertension in Israel,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: This study aims to calculate the health effects and costs of a proposed national hypertension prevention and control program. METHODS: Interventions are based on experience from our two programs: 10-year period of Ashkelon Hypertension Detection and Control Program (AHDC Program) and the Israel Blood Pressure Control (IBPC) program. The costs of a nationwide program were calculated based on economic data, training staff levels, course frequency and unit costs. RESULTS: Over the next 20 years, the program should decrease the risk in one-half of the treated hypertensive cases of the following ailments: cardiovascular events such as Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and Unstable Angina Pectoris (UAP) by 16.0%, stroke by 41.2%, End stage renal disease (ESRD) by 50.0% and peripheral vascular disease (PVD) by 42.6%. In total, around 2,242 lives, 35,117 years of life or 24,433 disability adjusted life years will be saved due to decreased mortality.Program costs amount to $352.7 million. However savings ($537.6 million), from reduced medical treatment ($444.3 million) and reduced pharmaceutical use ($93.3 million) as a result of morbidity decreases, exceed costs by $185.0 million. CONCLUSION: The project which saves both lives and resources should be extended nation-wide to reach as wide a population as possible.",2007-99-02940,18045461,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Chaim Yosefy,2007,5 /,16,Yes,18045461,"Chaim Yosefy; Gary Ginsberg; Reuven Viskoper; Dror Dicker; Dov Gavish; Cost-utility analysis of a national project to reduce hypertension in Israel, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2007; 5():1478-7547; 16",DALY,Israel,Not Stated,"Care Delivery, Pharmaceutical, Screening",Israel Blood Pressure Control (IBPC) program vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,-5715.34,United States,2005,-7573.95
26514,Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination in low-income countries: using cost-effectiveness affordability curves,"OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe a method that explicitly considers both a health-care programmes cost-effectiveness and its affordability. For illustration, we apply the method to the programme to vaccinate infants against hepatitis B in the Gambia. METHODS: We synthesized selected data and developed a computer-based model from the societal and payer perspectives to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of routine infant vaccination against hepatitis B in the Gambia compared with no vaccination. The primary outcome measure was cost per averted disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which was expressed in 2002 US dollars. We used Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty analysis to examine the affordability of the programme from the payers perspective, and we derived an affordability curve and cost-effectiveness affordability curves for the programme. FINDINGS: In the Gambia, vaccinating infants against hepatitis B is highly cost-effective. Compared with offering no intervention, the vaccination programme would cost US$ 28 per DALY averted from the societal perspective or US$ 47 per DALY averted from the payers perspective. The programme also has the potential to be affordable, starting at a relatively low budget of US$ 160,000 per year. Combining the two dimensions of the outcome measure, the probability that vaccinating infants would be both cost-effective and affordable is 40% at an annual programme budget of US$ 182,000 (the estimated total programme cost from the payers perspective), given a threshold cost-effectiveness value of US$ 47 per DALY averted. CONCLUSION: In the face of uncertainties about both the health and economic consequences of a vaccine programme, as well as the availability and magnitude of resources needed to fund the programme, cost-effectiveness affordability curves can provide information to decision-makers about the probability that a programme will be both cost-effective and affordable: these are distinct but equally relevant considerations in resource-poor settings.",2007-99-02947,18038073,Bull World Health Organ,Sun-Young Kim,2008,85 / 11,833-42,No,18038073,"Sun-Young Kim; Joshua A Salomon; Sue J Goldie; Economic evaluation of hepatitis B vaccination in low-income countries: using cost-effectiveness affordability curves, Bull World Health Organ, 2007-Nov; 85(11):0042-9686; 833-42",DALY,Gambia,Not Stated,Immunization,Immunization against Hepatitis B vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,47,United States,2002,67.62
26515,Cost-utility analysis to control Campylobacter on chicken meat: dealing with data limitations,"The current article describes the economic evaluation of interventions to control Campylobacter on chicken meat by means of a cost-utility analysis. Apart from the methodology used, the main focus of this article is on data gaps and assumptions made, and their impact on results and conclusions. The direct intervention costs, the relative risk, the disease burden (expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)), and the costs of illness for the various interventions are necessary inputs for the cost-utility analysis. The cost-utility ratio (CUR) -- the measure for efficiency -- is expressed in net costs per avoided DALY. Most data gaps were of a biological order, but for some interventions, information on costs was also scarce. As a consequence, assumptions had to be made, which had some impact on the estimated CUR. A higher (lower) incidence of Campylobacter infections associated with chicken meat, higher (lower) effectiveness, and lower (higher) intervention costs, respectively, would result in absolute better (worse) CUR estimates. By taking the perspective of all consumers eating Dutch chicken meat, rather than only the Dutch society, absolute better CUR estimates could be obtained. Indirect costs or a shift toward non-Dutch chicken meat would both result in higher CUR estimates. Despite the assumptions made, three interventions showed for most of the applied sensitivity analyses relatively favorable CUR estimates: limiting fecal leakage during processing, carcass decontamination by dipping in a chemical solution, and the phage therapy.

26570,Economic evaluation of Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccination in Indonesia: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) causes significant morbidity and mortality in children under five years of age. A safe and effective vaccine is available but is not in general use in developing countries. This paper evaluates the cost-effectiveness of introducing Hib vaccine in Indonesia as an addition to the country's current DTP-Hepatitis B vaccination program. METHODS: The economic analysis uses a societal perspective and is based on a 1-year birth cohort of 4.234 million. The disease status of children with and without Hib vaccination is modeled for the year, and health consequences are modeled over the expected life of the child. One-way, two-way, probabilistic and worst-case sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the results. RESULTS: Implementation of Hib vaccination in Indonesia would avert approximately 76,700 cases of invasive infection, more than 7,150 deaths and 273,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Compared to no vaccine, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is US $67 per DALY averted based on UNICEF pricing, whereas the program would save US $3.7 million with GAVI pricing. The result is not sensitive to uncertainty in disease incidence, costs of treatment or the probability of developing immunity. CONCLUSION: The model demonstrates significant cost-effectiveness of implementation of a Hib vaccination program for Indonesian society.",2007-99-03082,17875589,J Public Health (Oxf),Edward I Broughton,2007,29 / 4,441-8,No,17875589,"Edward I Broughton; Economic evaluation of Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccination in Indonesia: a cost-effectiveness analysis, J Public Health (Oxf), 2007-Dec; 29(4):1741-3842; 441-8",DALY,Indonesia,Not Stated,Immunization,Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine vs. DPT and hepatitis B vaccine without Hib vaccine included,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,67,United States,2005,88.79
26571,Cost-effectiveness of annual targeted larviciding campaigns in Cambodia against the dengue vector Aedes aegypti,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness (CE) of annual targeted larviciding campaigns from 2001 to 2005 against the dengue vector Aedes aegypti in two urban areas of Cambodia with a population of 2.9 million people. METHODS: The intervention under analysis consisted of annual larviciding campaigns targeting medium to large water storage containers in households and other premises. The CE compared the intervention against the hypothetical alternative of no intervention. The CE was calculated as the ratio of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) saved to the net cost of the intervention (in 2005 US dollars) by year. A sensitivity analysis explored the range of study parameters. RESULTS: The intervention reduced the number of dengue cases and deaths by 53%. It averted an annual average of 2980 dengue hospitalizations, 11,921 dengue ambulatory cases and 23 dengue deaths, resulting in a saving of 997 DALYs per year. The gross cost of the intervention was US $567,800 per year, or US $0.20 per person covered. As the intervention averted considerable medical care, the annual net cost of the intervention was US $312,214 (US $0.11 per person covered) from a public sector perspective and US $37,137 (US $0.01 per person covered) from a societal perspective. The resulting CE ratios were: US $313/DALY gained from the public perspective and US $37/DALY gained from the societal perspective. Even under the most conservative assumption, the intervention remained cost effective from both perspectives.

26572,Economic evaluation of delivering Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine in routine immunization services in Kenya,"OBJECTIVE: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine was introduced into routine immunization services in Kenya in 2001. We aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of Hib vaccine delivery. METHODS: A model was developed to follow the Kenyan 2004 birth cohort until death, with and without Hib vaccine. Incidence of invasive Hib disease was estimated at Kilifi District Hospital and in the surrounding demographic surveillance system in coastal Kenya. National Hib disease incidence was estimated by adjusting incidence observed by passive hospital surveillance using assumptions about access to care. Case fatality rates were also assumed dependent on access to care. A price of US$ 3.65 per dose of pentavalent diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-hep B-Hib vaccine was used. Multivariate Monte Carlo simulations were performed in order to assess the impact on the cost-effectiveness ratios of uncertainty in parameter values. FINDINGS: The introduction of Hib vaccine reduced the estimated incidence of Hib meningitis per 100,000 children aged < 5 years from 71 to 8; of Hib non-meningitic invasive disease from 61 to 7; and of non-bacteraemic Hib pneumonia from 296 to 34. The costs per discounted disability adjusted life year (DALY) and per discounted death averted were US$ 38 (95% confidence interval, CI: 26-63) and US$ 1197 (95% CI: 814-2021) respectively. Most of the uncertainty in the results was due to uncertain access to care parameters. The break-even pentavalent vaccine price--where incremental Hib vaccination costs equal treatment costs averted from Hib disease--was US$ 1.82 per dose. CONCLUSION: Hib vaccine is a highly cost-effective intervention in Kenya.

26579,"The costs, benefits, and cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in Mexico","In Mexico, the lifetime risk of dying from maternal causes is 1 in 370 compared to 1 in 2,500 in the U.S. Although national efforts have been made to improve maternal services in the last decade, it is unclear if Millennium Development Goal 5--to reduce maternal mortality by three-quarters by 2015--will be met.We developed an empirically calibrated model that simulates the natural history of pregnancy and pregnancy-related complications in a cohort of 15-year-old women followed over their lifetime. After synthesizing national and sub-national trends in maternal mortality, the model was calibrated to current intervention-specific coverage levels and validated by comparing model-projected life expectancy, total fertility rate, crude birth rate and maternal mortality ratio with Mexico-specific data. Using both published and primary data, we assessed the comparative health and economic outcomes of alternative strategies to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. A dual approach that increased coverage of family planning by 15%, and assured access to safe abortion for all women desiring elective termination of pregnancy, reduced mortality by 43% and was cost saving compared to current practice. The most effective strategy added a third component, enhanced access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care for at least 90% of women requiring referral. At a national level, this strategy reduced mortality by 75%, cost less than current practice, and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $300 per DALY relative to the next best strategy. Analyses conducted at the state level yielded similar results.Increasing the provision of family planning and assuring access to safe abortion are feasible, complementary and cost-effective strategies that would provide the greatest benefit within a short-time frame. Incremental improvements in access to high-quality intrapartum and emergency obstetric care will further reduce maternal deaths and disability.",2007-01-00111,17710149,PLoS One,Delphine Hu,2007,2 / 8,e750,No,17710149,"Delphine Hu; Stefano M Bertozzi; Emmanuela Gakidou; Steve Sweet; Sue J Goldie; Stefano M.

26580,Costs and benefits of smoking cessation aids: making a case for public reimbursement of nicotine replacement therapy in Australia,"BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in Australia and other developed countries. Of the pharmacological aids that are available for smoking cessation, bupropion (Zyban SR) is eligible for public reimbursement on the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS), whereas nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is not. Information on the cost-effectiveness and financial impact of public reimbursement of these strategies can better inform debate about their inclusion or exclusion in public reimbursement schemes. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of bupropion and NRT, and the potential financial impact of public reimbursement of NRT in Australia. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a deterministic Markov model, and cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted over a lifetime as the outcome measure. Population: Current smokers, motivated to quit, in Australia in 2000. INTERVENTIONS: (1) NRT; (2) bupropion; and (3) a combined strategy using bupropion as the first-line treatment and NRT in those who fail to quit smoking or have adverse reactions to bupropion. RESULTS: Quitting smoking can increase life expectancy of current smokers by 1-7.6 years depending on age at cessation and sex. Providing bupropion to current smokers who are motivated to quit would cost A$7900 (95% uncertainty interval A$6000 to A$10,500) for each DALY averted; NRT patches would cost A$17,000 (A$9000 to A$28,000) for each DALY averted, with similar results even if used as a second-line treatment following initial failure to quit using bupropion. If 6% of current smokers were to use NRT following inclusion on the PBS, this would result in an annual cost of A$40-110 million to the PBS depending on the listed price. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other drugs included on the PBS, bupropion and NRT are both highly cost-effective smoking cessation interventions, and including NRT on the PBS would have a moderate financial impact. Given the sizeable health burden of smoking, and the large individual benefits of quitting smoking, increasing the availability of alternative aids and uptake of these strategies through public reimbursement would be a positive and rational step towards further reducing tobacco-related disease burden in Australia and other countries where NRT is currently not subsidised.",2007-99-03184,17652241,Tob Control,Melanie Y Bertram,2007,16 / 4,255-60,No,17652241,"Melanie Y Bertram; Stephen S Lim; Angela L Wallace; Theo Vos; Costs and benefits of smoking cessation aids: making a case for public reimbursement of nicotine replacement therapy in Australia, Tob Control, 2007-Aug; 16(4):1468-3318; 255-60",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Nicotine replacement therapy for 6-12 weeks vs. Standard/Usual Care- mass-media campaigns and taxation on cigarettes,"Current smokers, motivated to quit",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,19298.2,Australia,2000,16866.65

26582,Potential cost-effectiveness of vaccination for rotavirus gastroenteritis in eight Latin American and Caribbean countries,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of vaccination for rotavirus gastroenteritis in eight Latin American and Caribbean countries: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela. METHODS: An economic model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination from the health care system perspective, using national administrative and published epidemiological evidence, country-specific cost estimates, and vaccine efficacy data. The model was applied to the first five years of life for the 2003 birth cohort in each country. The main health outcome was the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), and the main summary measure was the incremental cost per DALY averted. A 3% discount rate was used for all predicted costs and benefits. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the impact of uncertainty regarding key variables on cost-effectiveness estimates. RESULTS: According to the estimates obtained with the economic model, vaccination would prevent more than 65% of the medical visits, deaths, and treatment costs associated with rotavirus gastroenteritis in the eight countries analyzed here. At a cost of US$ 24 per course (for a two-dose vaccine), the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from 269 US dollars/DALY in Honduras to 10,656 US dollars/DALY in Chile. Cost-effectiveness ratios were sensitive to assumptions about vaccine price, mortality, and vaccine efficacy.

26590,Cost-effectiveness of rapid syphilis screening in prenatal HIV testing programs in Haiti,"BACKGROUND: New rapid syphilis tests permit simple and immediate diagnosis and treatment at a single clinic visit. We compared the cost-effectiveness, projected health outcomes, and annual cost of screening pregnant women using a rapid syphilis test as part of scaled-up prenatal testing to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission in Haiti. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A decision analytic model simulated health outcomes and costs separately for pregnant women in rural and urban areas. We compared syphilis syndromic surveillance (rural standard of care), rapid plasma reagin test with results and treatment at 1-wk follow-up (urban standard of care), and a new rapid test with immediate results and treatment. Test performance data were from a World Health Organization-Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases field trial conducted at the GHESKIO Center Groupe Haitien d'Etude du Sarcome de Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes in Port-au-Prince. Health outcomes were projected using historical data on prenatal syphilis treatment efficacy and included disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of newborns, congenital syphilis cases, neonatal deaths, and stillbirths. Cost-effectiveness ratios are in US dollars/DALY from a societal perspective; annual costs are in US dollars from a payer perspective. Rapid testing with immediate treatment has a cost-effectiveness ratio of $6.83/DALY in rural settings and $9.95/DALY in urban settings. Results are sensitive to regional syphilis prevalence, rapid test sensitivity, and the return rate for follow-up visits. Integrating rapid syphilis testing into a scaled-up national HIV testing and prenatal care program would prevent 1,125 congenital syphilis cases and 1,223 stillbirths or neonatal deaths annually at a cost of $525,000. CONCLUSIONS: In Haiti, integrating a new rapid syphilis test into prenatal care and HIV testing would prevent congenital syphilis cases and stillbirths, and is cost-effective.

We compared syphilis syndromic surveillance (rural standard of care), rapid plasma reagin test with results and treatment at 1-wk follow-up (urban standard of care), and a new rapid test with immediate results and treatment. Test performance data were from a World Health Organization-Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases field trial conducted at the GHESKIO Center Groupe Haitien d'Etude du Sarcome de Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes in Port-au-Prince. Health outcomes were projected using historical data on prenatal syphilis treatment efficacy and included disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of newborns, congenital syphilis cases, neonatal deaths, and stillbirths. Cost-effectiveness ratios are in US dollars/DALY from a societal perspective; annual costs are in US dollars from a payer perspective. Rapid testing with immediate treatment has a cost-effectiveness ratio of $6.83/DALY in rural settings and $9.95/DALY in urban settings. Results are sensitive to regional syphilis prevalence, rapid test sensitivity, and the return rate for follow-up visits. Integrating rapid syphilis testing into a scaled-up national HIV testing and prenatal care program would prevent 1,125 congenital syphilis cases and 1,223 stillbirths or neonatal deaths annually at a cost of $525,000.

26596,Plant breeding to control zinc deficiency in India: how cost-effective is biofortification?,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential impact of zinc biofortification of rice and wheat on public health in India and to evaluate its cost-effectiveness compared with alternative interventions and international standards. DESIGN: The burden of zinc deficiency (ZnD) in India was expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost. Current zinc intakes were derived from a nationally representative household food consumption survey (30-day recall) and attributed to household members based on adult equivalent weights. Using a dose-response function, projected increased zinc intakes from biofortified rice and wheat were translated into potential health improvements for pessimistic and optimistic scenarios. After estimating the costs of developing and disseminating the new varieties, the cost-effectiveness of zinc biofortification was calculated for both scenarios and compared with alternative micronutrient interventions and international reference standards. SETTING: India. SUBJECTS: Representative household survey (n = 119 554). RESULTS: The calculated annual burden of ZnD in India is 2.8 million DALYs lost. Zinc biofortification of rice and wheat may reduce this burden by 20-51% and save 0.6-1.4 million DALYs each year, depending on the scenario. The cost for saving one DALY amounts to $US 0.73-7.31, which is very cost-effective by standards of the World Bank and the World Health Organization, and is lower than that of most other micronutrient interventions. CONCLUSIONS: Not only may zinc biofortification save lives and prevent morbidity among millions of people, it may also help accommodate the need to economise and to allocate resources more efficiently.

26597,"Costs, health effects and cost-effectiveness of alcohol and tobacco control strategies in Estonia","OBJECTIVE: To assess the population-level costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of different alcohol and tobacco control strategies in Estonia. DESIGN: A WHO cost-effectiveness modelling framework was used to estimate the total costs and effects of interventions. Costs were assessed in Estonian Kroon (EEK) for the year 2000, while effects were expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Regional cost-effectiveness estimates for Eastern Europe, were used as baseline and were contextualised by including country-specific input data. RESULTS: Increased excise taxes are the most cost-effective intervention to reduce both hazardous alcohol consumption and smoking: 759 EEK (euro 49) and 218 EEK (euro 14) per DALY averted, respectively. Imposing additional advertising bans would cost 1331 EEK (euro 85) per DALY averted to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption and 304 EEK (euro 19) to reduce smoking. Compared to WHO-CHOICE regional estimates, interventions were less costly and thereby more cost-effective in Estonia.
