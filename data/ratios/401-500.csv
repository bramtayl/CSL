401,Cost-consequence models for varicella-zoster virus infections,"Three cost-consequence models were developed for treatment of infections due to varicella-zoster virus (VZV) with acyclovir in immunocompetent patients--adult- and childhood-onset chickenpox, and herpes zoster (shingles) in adults. For chickenpox, separate models allow examination of differences in severity and impact of the disease for children and adults, as well as in the management of civilians and adults in military service. Each model includes direct medical costs, indirect costs and health-related productivity loss, symptom and quality of life impact, and model assumptions and conclusions. Alternatives of treatment and no treatment are addressed. Quality of life impact is conceptualized in terms of a quality-adjusted life-days decrement due to VZV symptoms of importance to the patient, such as pain, rash, and itching. As experience and data become available, alternative agents such as valacyclovir and famciclovir for the treatment of patients with herpes zoster should be included in the modeling process.",1995-01-01848,8577631,Pharmacotherapy,J E Paul,1995,15 / 5 Pt 2,49S-58S,No,8577631,"J E Paul; J A Mauskopf; L Bell; Cost-consequence models for varicella-zoster virus infections, Pharmacotherapy, 1995 Sep-Oct; 15(5 Pt 2):0277-0008; 49S-58S",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with acyclovir (Zovirax) vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,-455600,United States,1994,-795642.99

403,The cost-effectiveness of lung transplantation. A pilot study. University of Washington Medical Center Lung Transplant Study Group,"OBJECTIVE: Lung transplantation is one of the fastest-growing solid organ transplant procedures in the world, yet its cost-effectiveness is unknown. We compared the costs and outcomes of the first 25 patients who received lung transplants at the University of Washington with 24 patients currently on the lung transplant waiting list. DESIGN: Inpatient and outpatient charges were obtained from the hospital billing service and home health agencies. Quality-adjusted life year scores (QALYs) were computed from the following: (1) utility scores obtained through standard gamble interviews, and (2) published survival data from an international lung transplant registry and from studies of patients on lung transplant waiting lists. RESULTS: Transplantation charges averaged $164,989 (median, $152,071). Average monthly charges posttransplant were $11,917 in year 1 and $4,525 thereafter, vs $3,395 for waiting-list patients. Posttransplant utility scores were significantly higher than waiting-list scores (0.80 vs 0.68; p < 0.001). Life expectancy was not greater for lung transplant vs waiting-list patients (5.89 vs 5.32 years; p > 0.05), although quality-adjusted life expectancy did improve significantly. After converting charges to costs, the incremental cost per QALY gained for posttransplant compared with waiting-list patients was $176,817. CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation is very expensive, although it can substantially improve quality of life. Two-thirds of care costs are incurred after transplantation. The principal barriers to cost-effectiveness at present are the high cost of postrecovery care and marginal gains in life expectancy compared with conservative care.",1995-01-01849,7497767,Chest,S D Ramsey,1995,108 / 6,1594-601,No,7497767,"S D Ramsey; D L Patrick; R K Albert; E B Larson; D E Wood; G Raghu; The cost-effectiveness of lung transplantation.

404,Modelling the cost effectiveness of antidepressant treatment in primary care,"The aim of this study was to estimate the cost effectiveness of nefazodone compared with imipramine or fluoxetine in treating women with major depressive disorder. Clinical decision analysis and a Markov state-transition model were used to estimate the lifetime health outcomes and medical costs of 3 antidepressant treatments. The model, which represents ideal primary care practice, compares treatment with nefazodone to treatment with either imipramine or fluoxetine. The economic analysis was based on the healthcare system of the Canadian province of Ontario, and considered only direct medical costs. Health outcomes were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs were in 1993 Canadian dollars ($Can; $Can1 = $US0.75, September 1995). Incremental cost-utility ratios were calculated comparing the relative lifetime discounted medical costs and QALYs associated with nefazodone with those of imipramine or fluoxetine. Data for constructing the model and estimating necessary parameters were derived from the medical literature, clinical trial data, and physician judgement. Data included information on: Ontario primary care physicians' clinical management of major depression; medical resource use and costs; probabilities of recurrence of depression; suicide rates; compliance rates; and health utilities. Estimates of utilities for depression-related hypothetical health states were obtained from patients with major depression (n = 70). Medical costs and QALYs were discounted to present value using a 5% rate. Sensitivity analyses tested the assumptions of the model by varying the discount rate, depression recurrence rates, compliance rates, and the duration of the model. The base case analysis found that nefazodone treatment costs $Can1447 less per patient than imipramine treatment (discounted lifetime medical costs were $Can50,664 vs $Can52,111) and increases the number of QALYs by 0.72 (13.90 vs 13.18). Nefazodone treatment costs $Can14 less than fluoxetine treatment (estimated discounted lifetime medical costs were $Can50,664 vs $Can50,678) and produces slightly more QALYs (13.90 vs 13.79). In the sensitivity analyses, the cost-effectiveness ratios comparing nefazodone with imipramine ranged from cost saving to $Can17,326 per QALY gained. The cost-effectiveness ratios comparing nefazodone with fluoxetine ranged from cost saving to $Can7327 per QALY gained. The model was most sensitive to assumptions about treatment compliance rates and recurrence rates.

407,Hemophilia home treatment. Economic analysis and implications for health policy,"This analysis describes the development of technology for home self-infusion of factor VII in the treatment of hemophilia and its clinical, economic, and social consequences, and uses the case study of such home care treatment to illustrate the potentials and pitfalls of formal economic analyses of programs to treat chronically ill children. A comprehensive review of all original data on hemophilia programs, their related costs, and outcomes, conducted from 1966 through 1993, examined the economic outcomes for two hypothetical cohorts, one aged 0-4 years and the other aged 30-34 years. Including the measurement of treatment effects on the productivity of parental caregivers substantially increases the benefit-cost relationship of an intervention directed at chronically ill children. Increased economic productivity and societal return resulting from such a program for young adults exceeds those for a cohort of children, primarily due to assumptions related to discounting. However, estimation of quality-adjusted life years favors the younger age cohort, since children survive for a longer period of time and with each year survived comes a higher quality of life. Unlike simpler instances in which economic benefits can be shown to outweigh resource costs, policy decisions concerning services for chronically ill children raise an additional set of complex analytic issues. Inclusion of the benefits in productivity experienced by family caregivers provides an important added dimension to such analyses. The development of cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness analyses of these programs illustrates the importance of careful measurement of outcomes and explicit statements of underlying assumptions.

409,Setting priorities for the Children's Vaccine Initiative: a cost-effectiveness approach,"To help the Children's Vaccine Initiative (CVI) achieve its goal of new and improved children's vaccines, we developed and applied a cost-effectiveness model to set priorities for vaccine development.

It measures costs as the net cost of developing, procuring, and administering the vaccine to the same population and time frame compared to the status quo (the current vaccine, if any). It weights each dollar of in-kind allocation of the existing health infrastructure less heavily than a dollar cash outlay to purchase new vaccine to reflect severe constraints on foreign exchange and non-personnel costs. It expresses cost-effectiveness as the net cost per QALY. The model was applied to 13 candidate vaccines selected by the CVI for initial analysis on the basis of their near-term feasibility.

422,Cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy after myocardial infarction,"OBJECTIVES. This study sought to assess the cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy for survivors of myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. The recent randomized, controlled Survival and Ventricular Enlargement (SAVE) trial showed that captopril therapy improves survival in survivors of myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction < or = 40%. The present ancillary study was designed to determine how the costs required to achieve this increase in survival compared with those of other medical interventions. METHODS. We developed a decision-analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy in 50- to 80-year old survivors of myocardial infarction with an ejection fraction < or = 40%. Data on costs, utilities (health-related quality of life weights) and 4-year survival were obtained directly from the SAVE trial, and long-term survival was estimated using a Markov model. In one set of analyses, we assumed that the survival benefit associated with captopril therapy would persist beyond 4 years (persistent-benefit analyses), whereas in another set we assumed that captopril therapy incurred costs but no survival benefit beyond 4 years (limited-benefit analyses). RESULTS. In the limited-benefit analyses, the incremental cost-effectiveness of captopril therapy ranged from $3,600/quality-adjusted life-year for 80-year old patients to $60,800/quality-adjusted life-year for 50-year old patients. In the persistent-benefit analyses, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from $3,700 to $10,400/quality-adjusted life-year, depending on age. The outcome was generally not sensitive to changes in estimates of variables when they were varied individually over wide ranges. In a ""worst-case"" analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for captopril therapy remained favorable ($8,700 to $29,200/quality-adjusted life-year) for 60- to 80-year old patients but were higher ($217,600/quality-adjusted life-year) for 50-year old patients.

The patients had a partial response after three cycles of chemotherapy and had no evidence of BM involvement of NHL. The overall and disease-free survival at 3 years were 61% and 60%, respectively, in the ABMT group and 85% and 77% in the CHOP group (P = NS). Moreover, there were more (severe) complications and symptoms in the ABMT than in the CHOP group. The average costs of CHOP chemotherapy were significantly lower than the average costs in the ABMT group (CHOP: US$ 3118 vs ABMT: US$ 34,447). Considering long-term consequences the ABMT group was more expensive (US$ 34,580) and patients experienced 0.14 life years and 0.22 quality adjusted life years less than the CHOP group (discount rate 5%). As a result, changing therapy from CHOP to ABMT, as primary treatment in slow responders to CHOP, can not be recommended as the required additional investment does not produce health gains in terms of survival or quality of life.",1995-01-01854,8535321,Bone Marrow Transplant,C A Uyl-de Groot,1995,16 / 3,463-70,No,8535321,"C A Uyl-de Groot; A Hagenbeek; L F Verdonck; B Löwenberg; F F Rutten; Cost-effectiveness of ABMT in comparison with CHOP chemotherapy in patients with intermediate- and high-grade malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), Bone Marrow Transplant, 1995-Sep; 16(3):0268-3369; 463-70",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Autologous bone marrow transplantation vs. Five additional courses of CHOP chemotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-73704.08,United States,1992,-135961.7
427,Immediate biopsy versus observation for abnormal findings on mammograms: an analysis of potential outcomes and costs,"BACKGROUND: The increased usage of screening mammography has led to an increase in the number of needle localized breast biopsies. The perceived low yield of the biopsies has caused concern about the costs and effectiveness of this procedure. Arguments have centered on what is the appropriate true-positive rate for screening mammography, and which abnormal findings may be observed rather than tested immediately. METHODS: A decision analysis was done to help answer these questions. Factors evaluated included age of patient at discovery of abnormal finding, the rate of follow-up mammograms eventually requiring biopsy, the potential effects of tumor-doubling time on increasing the stage of disease, quality-of-life issues, and costs. RESULTS: For an average 50-year-old woman the quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) was longer for immediate biopsy by 0 to 3 years, depending on the assumptions on tumor-doubling time; however, immediate biopsy increased the cost per patient from $700 to $900. The QALE was also superior for immediate biopsy if more than 30% of follow-up mammograms required biopsy, and immediate biopsy was more cost effective if more than 36% of follow-up mammograms required biopsy. Patient age did not affect the superiority of immediate biopsy over observation, although quality-of-life issues did. CONCLUSIONS: Those lesions with a greater than 20% to 30% probability of being malignant, or lesions with potentially short doubling times, should undergo immediate biopsy. Lesions judged to be at lower risk may be observed for 6 months.

429,Cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha 2b treatment for hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha 2B for the treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis B infection who are positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). DESIGN: Meta-analysis of nine randomized controlled trials and cost-effectiveness analysis, projecting the clinical and economic outcomes expected from changes in serologic markers of hepatitis B viral replication. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE search, expert panel opinion, hospital cost data, and adjusted physician charges. PATIENTS: 552 patients with confirmed chronic hepatitis B infection who were positive for HBeAg. INTERVENTION: Interferon-alpha 2b. MEASUREMENTS: Lifetime incidence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma; life expectancy; quality-adjusted life expectancy; and costs and marginal cost-effectiveness ratios from a societal perspective. RESULTS: Interferon-alpha 2b increases the likelihood of becoming negative for HBeAg from 9.1% to 45.6% (difference, 36.5%; 95% CI, 23.7% to 49.2%) and of becoming negative for hepatitis B surface antigen from 1.7% to 7.7% (difference, 6.0%; CI, 2.8% to 9.3%) in the first year. For a 35-year-old person with chronic hepatitis B who is HBeAg positive, our analysis suggests that interferon-alpha 2b will increase life expectancy by 3.1 years or 3.4 quality-adjusted life-years and will decrease projected lifetime costs, even if future savings are discounted; thus, interferon-alpha 2b is the dominant strategy. Even with the model biased strongly in favor of standard care, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of interferon did not exceed $12,000 per life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Interferon-alpha 2b should prolong life and lower costs for patients with chronic hepatitis B who are HBeAg positive.",1995-01-01857,7702228,Ann Intern Med,J B Wong,1995,122 / 9,664-75,No,7702228,"J B Wong; R S Koff; F Tinè; S G Pauker; Cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha 2b treatment for hepatitis B e antigen-positive chronic hepatitis B, Ann Intern Med, 1995-May-01; 122(9):1539-3704; 664-75",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Interferon treatment vs. Standard care,Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,Male,Full,Not Stated,5.00,5.00,-617.65,United States,1994,-1078.64
430,Cost-effectiveness of MR angiography in cases of limb-threatening peripheral vascular disease,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of magnetic resonance (MR) angiography in the preoperative planning of treatment in patients with limb-threatening peripheral vascular disease (PVD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A decision model was developed to study the effects of MR angiography on the outcome and cost of treatment. The authors calculated the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained (ie, cost-effectiveness ratio) when conventional angiography was replaced or supplemented with MR angiography. Previously reported data regarding the accuracies of MR and conventional angiography were used in the analysis. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratio of MR angiography ranged from negative (cost-reducing) values to $78,000. For the base case in which the sensitivity and specificity of MR angiography for the evaluation of inflow vessels were 92% and 88% and those of conventional angiography were 97% and 97%, respectively, the cost-effectiveness ratio was $25,895. CONCLUSION: MR angiography may be a cost-effective alternative to conventional angiography in patients with limb-threatening PVD if its accuracy for the inflow evaluation reaches certain thresholds.

440,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation: what cost to cheat death?,"OBJECTIVES: To review the various outcomes from cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the factors that influence these outcomes, the costs associated with CPR, and the application of cost-analyses to CPR. DATA SOURCES: Data used to prepare this article were drawn from published articles and work in progress. STUDY SELECTION: Articles were selected for their relevance to the subjects of CPR and cost-analysis by MEDLINE keyword search. DATA EXTRACTION: The authors extracted all applicable data from the English literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: Cost-analysis studies of CPR programs are limited by the high variation in resources consumed and attribution of cost to these resources. Furthermore, cost projections have not been adjusted to reflect patient-dependent variation in outcome. Variation in the patient's underlying condition, presenting cardiac rhythm, time to provision of definitive CPR, and effective perfusion all influence final outcome and, consequently, influence the cost-effectiveness of CPR programs. Based on cost data from previous studies, preliminary estimates of the cost-effectiveness of CPR programs for all 6-month survivors of a large international multicenter collaborative trial are $406,605.00 per life saved (range $344,314.00 to $966,759.00), and $225,892.00 per quality-adjusted-life-year (range $191,286.00 to $537,088.00). CONCLUSIONS: Reported outcome from CPR has varied from reasonable rates of good recovery, including return to full employment to 100% mortality.

441,Lifetime benefits and costs of intensive therapy as practiced in the diabetes control and complications trial. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group,"OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of alternative approaches to the management of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). DESIGN: A Monte Carlo simulation model was developed to estimate the lifetime benefits and costs of conventional and intensive insulin therapy. Data were collected as part of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and supplemented with data from other clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. SETTING: Twenty-nine academic medical centers. PATIENTS: Persons with IDDM in the United States who meet demographic and clinical eligibility criteria for enrollment in the DCCT. INTERVENTIONS: Conventional vs intensive diabetes management. RESULTS: Approximately 120 000 persons with IDDM in the United States meet DCCT eligibility criteria. Implementing intensive rather than conventional therapy in this population would result in a gain of 920 000 years of sight, 691 000 years free from end-stage renal disease, 678 000 years free from lower extremity amputation, and 611 000 years of life at an additional cost of $4.0 billion over the lifetime of the population. The incremental cost per year of life gained is $28 661.

442,An economic evaluation of finasteride for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia,"This evaluation was conducted at the request of a Canadian provincial government considering finasteride for formulary inclusion. The comparator therapies, in accordance with Canadian pharmacoeconomic guidelines, were the most prevalent treatment [transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)] and the lowest cost treatment (watchful waiting). All costs were measured in 1994 Canadian dollars ($Can), and both costs and outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum. Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios were calculated, and were found to be dependent on initial symptom severity and the anticipated duration of treatment with finasteride. The drug was shown to be the dominant alternative compared with both TURP and watchful waiting for patients with moderate symptoms, when the duration of drug therapy is 3 years or less. However, finasteride is a weak alternative for patients with severe symptoms who are treated for 4 years or more. For other groups of patients (i.e. moderate symptoms and on finasteride for 4 years or more; severe symptoms and on treatment for 3 years or less), the drug can improve health-related quality of life, but at a cost of between $Can3000 and $Can97,000 per incremental quality-adjusted life year (1994 dollars).

454,Cost-effective models for flutamide for prostate carcinoma patients: are they helpful to policy makers?,"BACKGROUND: More than 50,000 male patients received hormonal therapy for metastatic prostate carcinoma in 1995. Nonsteroidal antiandrogens, such as flutamide, when used in conjunction with castration, are effective in prolonging the time to progression of disease and survival. Only one-third of newly diagnosed patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma receive flutamide. Physicians may be reluctant to prescribe flutamide because of quality of life, toxicity, and cost considerations. METHODS: Physician focus groups evaluated quality of life factors for metastatic prostate cancer. RESULTS: Using quality of life estimates with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) 0036 clinical trial results, our revised model of flutamide use predicted that, for minimal disease, survival increased by 4.33 quality adjusted months (QAMs) at an incremental cost of $25,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved and for severe disease, survival increased by 4.11 QAM at a cost of $18,000 per QALY saved. However, if quality of life estimates are used in conjunction with the Prostate Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (PCTCG) meta-analysis estimates, survival increased by 2.1 QAM at an incremental cost of $41,000 per QALY saved for persons with severe disease and increased by 2.6 QAM at an incremental cost of $53,700 per QALY saved for persons with minimal disease. CONCLUSIONS: Using NCI 0036 trial data, flutamide has an incremental cost-effectiveness more favorable than most therapies, while estimates based on the PCTCG found a less favorable outcome for the drug.

456,Blunt thoracic aortic trauma. A cost-utility approach for injury detection,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the influences of patient preference and treatment costs on the diagnostic approach to blunt aortic trauma. METHODS: Decision and cost-utility analysis. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search of all literature dealing with the diagnosis and management of blunt aortic injury was used to establish assumptions and assign baseline probability estimates. Utility assignments were made from published data and our own assignments. We obtained institution-specific cost data. STUDY SELECTION: Only randomized, prospective trials that used aortography as the gold standard test were used to assign baseline accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography and dynamic chest computed tomography. Other baseline estimates were taken from class II and class III published data. DATA SYNTHESIS: A decision tree compared 4 diagnostic approaches for blunt chest trauma after an initial normal chest radiograph: observation with follow-up chest radiography, aortography, transesophageal echocardiography, and dynamic chest computed tomography. Utility (a quality-of-life measure) was assigned to ultimate health states to incorporate patient preference. Chest radiography and aortography had similar utility. Aortography gained 1 quality-adjusted life year for minimal cost. Transesophageal echocardiography and dynamic chest computed tomography lose quality-adjusted life-years at increased cost.

459,A cost-effectiveness analysis of total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the hip,"OBJECTIVE: To quantify the trade-off between the expected increased short- and long-term costs and the expected increase in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) associated with total hip arthroplasty (THA) for persons with functionally significant hip osteoarthritis. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness study was performed from the societal perspective by constructing stochastic tree, decision analytic models designed to estimate lifetime functional outcomes and costs of THA and nonoperative managements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A modified four-state American College of Rheumatology functional status classification was used to measure effectiveness. These functional classes were assigned utility values to allow the relative effectiveness of THA to be expressed in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Lifetime costs included costs associated with primary and potential revision surgeries and long-term care costs associated with the functionally dependent class. DATA USED IN THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS MODEL: Probability and incidence rate data were summarized from the literature. The THA hospital cost data were obtained from local teaching hospitals' cost accounting systems. Estimates of recurring medical costs for functionally significant hip osteoarthritis and for custodial care were derived from the literature. RESULTS: The THA cost-effectiveness ratio increases with age and is higher for men than for women. In the base-case scenario for 60-year-old white women who have functionally significant but not dependent hip osteoarthritis, the model predicts that THA is cost saving because of the high costs of custodial care associated with dependency due to worsening hip osteoarthritis and that the procedure increases QALE by about 6.9 years. In the base-case scenario for men aged 85 years and older, the average lifetime cost associated with THA is $9100 more than nonoperative management, with an average increase in QALE of about 2 years. Thus, the THA cost-effectiveness ratio for men aged 85 years and older is $4600 per QALY gained, less than that of procedures intended to extend life such as coronary artery bypass surgery or renal dialysis. Worst-case analysis suggests that THA remains minimally cost-effective for this oldest age category ($80,000/QALY) even if probabilities, rates, utilities, costs, and the discount rate are simultaneously varied to extreme values that bias the analysis against surgery. CONCLUSIONS: For persons with hip osteoarthritis associated with significant functional limitation, THA can be cost saving or, at worst, cost- effective in improving QALE when both short- and long-term outcomes are considered. Further research is needed to determine whether this procedure is actually being used in this cost-effective manner, especially in older age categories.",1996-01-01866,8596224,JAMA,R W Chang,1996,275 / 11,858-65,No,8596224,"R W Chang; J M Pellisier; G B Hazen; A cost-effectiveness analysis of total hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis of the hip, JAMA, 1996-Mar-20; 275(11):1538-3598; 858-65",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,THA vs. No THA,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated,3.00,3.00,-17120.78,United States,1991,-32533.39

461,Screening for mild thyroid failure at the periodic health examination: a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of periodic screening for mild thyroid failure by measurement of serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using a state-transition computer decision model that accounted for case finding, medical consequences of mild thyroid failure, and costs of care during 40 years of simulated follow-up. SETTING: Periodic health examinations in offices of primary care physicians. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohorts of women and men screened every 5 years during the recommended periodic examination, beginning at age 35 years. INTERVENTIONS: Adding the serum TSH assay to total serum cholesterol screening was compared to cholesterol screening alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and direct medical costs from a societal perspective. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness of screening 35-year-old patients with a serum TSH assay every 5 years was $9223 per QALY for women and $22595 per QALY for men. The cost-effectiveness became more favorable when age at first screening was increased for both sexes and was always more favorable for women than men. Reduced progression to overt hypothyroidism and relief of symptoms increased QALYs, but did not substantially reduce direct medical costs. Finding hypercholesterolemia induced by mild thyroid failure reduced direct medical costs, but did not substantially increase QALYs. The cost of a TSH assay and the importance to patients of symptoms associated with thyroid failure were the most influential factors in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of screening for mild thyroid failure compares favorably with other generally accepted preventive medical practices. Physicians should consider measuring serum TSH concentration in patients aged 35 years and older undergoing routine periodic health examinations. The cost-effectiveness of screening is most favorable in elderly women.",1996-01-01867,8656540,JAMA,M D Danese,1996,276 / 4,285-92,No,8656540,"M D Danese; N R Powe; C T Sawin; P W Ladenson; Screening for mild thyroid failure at the periodic health examination: a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis, JAMA, 1996 Jul 24-31; 276(4):1538-3598; 285-92",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,TSH screening vs. No TSH screening,Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,Female,Full,Not Stated,3.00,3.00,9223,United States,1994,16106.71

463,Cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The value of screening for asymptomatic carotid stenosis has become an important issue with the recently reported beneficial effect of endarterectomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using Doppler ultrasound as a screening tool to select subjects for arteriography and subsequent surgery. METHODS: A computer model was developed to simulate the cost-effectiveness of screening a cohort of 1000 men during a 20-year period. The primary outcome measure was incremental present-value dollar expenditures for screening and treatment per incremental present-value quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. Estimates of disease prevalence and arteriographic and surgical complication rates were obtained from the literature. Probabilities of stroke and death with surgical and medical treatment were obtained from published clinical trials. Doppler ultrasound sensitivity and specificity were obtained through review of local experience. Estimates of costs were obtained from local Medicare reimbursement data. RESULTS: A one-time screening program of a population with a high prevalence (20%) of > or = 60% stenosis cost $35130 per incremental QALY gained. Decreased surgical benefit or increased annual discount rate was detrimental, resulting in lost QALYs. Annual screening cost $457773 per incremental QALY gained. In a low-prevalence (4%) population, one-time screening cost $52588 per QALY gained, while annual screening was detrimental. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of a one-time screening program for an asymptomatic population with a high prevalence of carotid stenosis may be cost-effective. Annual screening is detrimental.

473,Cognitive-educational treatment of fibromyalgia: a randomized clinical trial. II. Economic evaluation,"OBJECTIVE: In this 3 year randomized clinical trial the cost effectiveness of a 6 week educational/cognitive intervention (ECO) is compared with an educational discussion intervention (EDI) and a waiting list condition (WLC). METHODS: A total of 131 patients with fibromyalgia were randomly allocated to the ECO, EDI, or WLC intervention. The ECO and EDI groups were followed for 12 months, whereas the WLC group was followed for 6 weeks. Direct health care and nonhealth care costs, and the indirect costs associated with lost production due to illness, were calculated. The effects were measured in terms of utilities, using rating scale and standard gamble methods. RESULTS: Treatment costs were estimated to be US $980 per patient for both ECO and EDI. The total direct health care costs of ECO treatment were US $1623 higher than those for EDI. This difference was significant. Indirect costs for the 2 groups were not significantly different. At 6 weeks there was a significant difference in rating scale utilities between the 3 groups, caused by a significantly greater improvement in the EDI group compared to the WLC group. However, no significant differences in either rating scale or standard gamble utilities were found between the ECO and EDI groups immediately after treatment, or at the 6 or 12 month followups. CONCLUSION: The economic evaluation showed that the addition of a cognitive component to the educational intervention led to significantly higher health care costs and no additional improvement in quality of life compared to the educational intervention alone. This conclusion is robust through a range of plausible values used in a sensitivity analysis.",1996-01-01870,8823700,J Rheumatol,M E Goossens,1996,23 / 7,1246-54,No,8823700,"M E Goossens; M P Rutten-van Mölken; R M Leidl; S G Bos; J W Vlaeyen; N J Teeken-Gruben; Cognitive-educational treatment of fibromyalgia: a randomized clinical trial.

474,The prostate: decreasing cost-effectiveness of biopsy with advancing age,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of prostate biopsy at different excess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as a function of age. METHODS: Medical decision analysis was performed with standard software (SMLTREE) to determine marginal effectiveness in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and marginal cost-effectiveness in dollars per QALY of immediate prostate biopsy at different excess PSA levels between 0 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL. The probability of clinically significant cancer with a positive biopsy (pD+Bx+) was assumed to decrease with age from 1.0 at age 50 to 0.2 at age 70. Costs were based on charges at our hospital and were considered over a 2-year time frame. RESULTS: With our base case assumptions there was a decrease in QALYs and an increase in costs doing an immediate prostate biopsy at all excess PSA levels between 0 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL, compared with not biopsying the prostate at > or = 70 years. Doubling pD+Bx+ from 0.2 to 0.4 in the 70-and-older age group resulted in a small increase in QALYs in biopsying the prostate at excess PSA levels between 0 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL.

475,The prostate: decreasing cost-effectiveness of biopsy with advancing age,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of prostate biopsy at different excess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels as a function of age. METHODS: Medical decision analysis was performed with standard software (SMLTREE) to determine marginal effectiveness in quality adjusted life years (QALYs) and marginal cost-effectiveness in dollars per QALY of immediate prostate biopsy at different excess PSA levels between 0 ng/mL and 20 ng/mL. The probability of clinically significant cancer with a positive biopsy (pD+Bx+) was assumed to decrease with age from 1.0 at age 50 to 0.2 at age 70. Costs were based on charges at our hospital and were considered over a 2-year time frame.

477,"Should ERCP be routine after an episode of ""idiopathic"" pancreatitis? A cost-utility analysis","BACKGROUND: Patients often recover from an episode of acute pancreatitis with conservative therapy and without an identified cause. The options include proceeding with ERCP to identify and treat an occult common bile duct stone or performing the procedure only after a second episode of idiopathic pancreatitis occurs. METHODS: Decision analysis (SMLTREE software) was used to determine incremental cost-utility. Variables were estimated from a search of the literature, a utility analysis involving health professionals familiar with the question, and a retrospective review of hospital charts and costs. RESULTS: This model estimates an incremental utility gain for the prompt ERCP approach of 1.0 quality-adjusted life weeks per patient at an incremental cost of $245 (Canadian). This yields a cost-utility ratio of $12,740 (Canadian) per quality-adjusted life year. The result was highly sensitive to the probability of finding an occult common bile duct stone. CONCLUSION: Routine ERCP is of marginal overall benefit, but is of more substantial benefit and is more cost-effective in a subgroup of patients with a greater probability of having an occult common duct stone.",1996-01-01872,8858315,Gastrointest Endosc,J C Gregor,1996,44 / 2,118-23,No,8858315,"J C Gregor; T P Ponich; A S Detsky; Should ERCP be routine after an episode of ""idiopathic"" pancreatitis?

The behavioral group intervention was shown to increase condom use behaviors significantly. This study retrospectively assessed the intervention's cost-effectiveness. METHODS: Standard methods of cost and cost-utility analysis were used. RESULTS: The intervention cost was just over $2000 for each quality-adjusted life-year saved; this is favorable compared with other life-saving programs.

480,A new decision model for cost-utility comparisons of chemotherapy in recurrent metastatic breast cancer,"In the absence of comparative clinical and pharmacoeconomic trial data for docetaxel versus paclitaxel as second-line therapy for patients with anthracycline-resistant metastatic breast cancer, a computer-based decision-analysis model was designed to evaluate the comparative utility to patients of these two taxoids. The model used the Markov process to analyse disease states (response, stable disease, progressive disease) and toxicities (acute, cumulative) for each treatment during the period from commencement of up to six 3-weekly cycles of chemotherapy, to death. A cost-utility analysis was carried out using the model, with a probability, a cost and a utility determined for each health state. Response rates were obtained from clinical trial data supplemented by expert clinical opinion. Costs were taken from UK national databases and published sources and the published UK prices of docetaxel and paclitaxel. Utilities for the various health states were established by use of standard gamble and visual analogue methods assessed by 30 oncology nurses in the UK who were acting as proxy patients. The results of the model showed that response rate is the key parameter determining the utility and cost utility of treatments for metastatic breast cancer. Although the total per-patient cost associated with docetaxel was marginally higher than that for paclitaxel (8233 pounds vs 8013 pounds), the higher response rate associated with docetaxel produced an improvement in utility to the patient at an incremental healthcare cost that is acceptable according to available defined limits. Sensitivity analyses revealed that, although the model was sensitive to changes in response rate and drug costs, the cost-utility ratio for docetaxel versus paclitaxel varied within acceptable limits in response to all likely changes in key parameters. In summary, in the base case used in this model, docetaxel produces a substantially larger utility benefit than paclitaxel, at a small additional cost per QALY gained (equivalent to 7 pounds per additional day of perfect health).",1996-01-01875,10163967,Pharmacoeconomics,J Hutton,1996,9 Suppl 2 /,8-22,Yes,10163967,"J Hutton; R Brown; M Borowitz; K Abrams; M Rothman; A Shakespeare; A new decision model for cost-utility comparisons of chemotherapy in recurrent metastatic breast cancer, Pharmacoeconomics, 1996; 9 Suppl 2():1179-2027; 8-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Second-line treatment with docetaxel vs. Second-line treatment with paclitaxel,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,2431,United Kingdom,1994,6503.34
481,Prioritising elective care: a cost utility analysis of orthopaedics in the north west of England,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: To produce a priority list for purchasers to use when purchasing elective care in the speciality of orthopaedics so that efficiency in health care purchasing (that is, maximising the benefit per unit of resource available for the resident population) can be achieved. DESIGN: The study used cost utility analysis in the elective speciality of orthopaedics. The diagnostic groups in the study were chosen on the basis of those conditions that constituted the greatest proportion of the orthopaedic waiting list, and consequently the greatest proportion of activity within the speciality. Costs were derived by two methods: the extra contractual referral tariff (ECR) and individual patient based costings. Outcome was assessed before surgery and again approximately six months afterwards. The outcome of the procedures was derived in two ways: Rosser and EuroQol indices. SETTING: The study took place at Wrightington hospital, a specialist orthopaedic hospital in north west England. PATIENTS: Prospective assessments were obtained from 99 patients for nine orthopaedics procedures. All the patients were individually interviewed on each occasion. Rosser and EuroQol assessments were completed for each patient by the patient and the patient's consultant before and after surgery. MAIN RESULTS: Priority lists presenting cost utility rankings for each of the procedures were derived from the patients' and consultants' assessments. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to generate priority lists in a systematic way. Purchasers may then use the results from these priority lists to help them maximise the benefits per unit of resource for their resident population.",1996-01-01876,8762386,J Epidemiol Community Health,M James,1996,50 / 2,182-9,No,8762386,"M James; S St Leger; K V Rowsell; Prioritising elective care: a cost utility analysis of orthopaedics in the north west of England, J Epidemiol Community Health, 1996-Apr; 50(2):0143-005X; 182-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Not Stated,6.00,Not Stated,Not Stated,United Kingdom,1991,Not Stated
482,Cost-effectiveness of detecting and treating diabetic retinopathy,"OBJECTIVE: To determine, from the health insurer's perspective, the cost of preventing vision loss in patients with diabetes mellitus through ophthalmologic screening and treatment and to calculate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions as compared with that of other medical interventions. DESIGN: Computer modeling, incorporating data from population-based epidemiologic studies and multicenter clinical trials. Monte Carlo simulation was used, combined with sensitivity analysis and present value analysis of cost savings. RESULTS: Screening and treatment of eye disease in patients with diabetes mellitus costs $3190 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved.

485,Cost-effectiveness of fracture prevention in established osteoporosis,"This study presents the results of a computer simulation model for calculating the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of treating patients with established osteoporosis in order to reduce the risk of fractures. The results are based on Swedish data for risk of fracture and costs. The treatment intervention modelled is based on treatment of a 62-year-old woman with established osteoporosis. The cost per hip fracture avoided is 350,000 SEK, assuming a 50% reduction in the risk of fracture due to 5 years of treatment. A sensitivity analysis for changes in the cost and effectiveness of treatment, the risk of fracture and the discount rate is performed. The cost per life-year gained and the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained is presented to enable comparison of the cost-effectiveness of treating osteoporosis with that of other health care interventions. A comparison between treating the same woman for osteoporosis and mild hypertension shows a cost per life-year gained of 220,000 SEK and 128,000 SEK respectively. Cost per QALY gained is very similar for the two interventions: 105,000 SEK and 103,000 SEK respectively.

488,Cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha and conventional chemotherapy in chronic myelogenous leukemia,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha with that of hydroxyurea as initial therapy for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase. DESIGN: A decision analysis and Markov model that described the natural history of the therapeutic process. The Markov model contained two treatment arms (interferon-alpha and hydroxyurea) and eight states of health (complete hematologic remission with cytogenetic response, complete hematologic remission without cytogenetic response, partial hematologic remission, chronic phase without hematologic remission, accelerated phase, blast crisis, bone marrow transplantation, and death). Probabilities, costs, and utilities were obtained from published clinical studies and clinical investigators. MEASUREMENT: Quality-adjusted years of life saved and costs and qualities discounted at 5% per year. SETTING: University medical centers in North America and Europe. PATIENTS: Meta-analysis of results from patients studied in clinical trials. RESULTS: The model's predictions of median survival (69 months with interferon-alpha therapy and 58 months with hydroxyurea therapy) were derived from data in the recent literature. In patients 50 years of age, interferon-alpha improved life expectancy over hydroxyurea by approximately 18 months. The marginal cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha (incremental discounted cost of interferon-alpha compared with that of conventional therapy) was $34800 per quality-adjusted year of life saved. The model was sensitive to the monthly cost of interferon-alpha therapy (if the cost of interferon-alpha is reduced by one third, the cost-effectiveness becomes $19300 per quality-adjusted year of life saved) but was not particularly sensitive to the costs associated with blast crisis or bone marrow transplantation. The other significant variable was quality of life during therapy with interferon-alpha; when this measure was varied from 70% to 100% of the quality of life during hydroxyurea therapy, cost-effectiveness changed from $123200 to $25620 per quality-adjusted year of life saved. When the quality of life associated with interferon-alpha was less than 62% of the quality of life associated with hydroxyurea, the discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy with interferon-alpha was less than that with hydroxyurea. CONCLUSION: Compared with hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha is, in most clinical scenarios, a cost-effective initial therapy for patients with chronic-phase CML who can tolerate the drug.",1996-01-01880,8815752,Ann Intern Med,M W Kattan,1996,125 / 7,541-8,No,8815752,"M W Kattan; Y Inoue; F J Giles; M Talpaz; H Ozer; F Guilhot; E Zuffa; S L Huber; J R Beck; Cost-effectiveness of interferon-alpha and conventional chemotherapy in chronic myelogenous leukemia, Ann Intern Med, 1996-Oct-01; 125(7):1539-3704; 541-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Interferon-alpha therapy vs. Hydroxyurea therapy,Not Stated,50 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,34800,United States,1995,59098.57
489,Cost-effectiveness of routine coronary angiography after acute myocardial infarction,"BACKGROUND: Coronary angiography is indicated for many patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). There are a number of subgroups of AMI patients, however, for whom the indication for coronary angiography is not well established. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a decision-analytic model for AMI in representative patient subgroups based on relevant clinical characteristics. The model estimates quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct lifetime costs for two strategies: coronary angiography and treatment guided by its results versus initial medical therapy without angiography. Decision tree chance node probabilities were estimated with the use of pooled data from randomized clinical trials and other relevant literature, costs were estimated with the use of the Medicare Part A database, and quality of life adjustments were derived from a survey of 1051 patients who had had a recent AMI. In our analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for coronary angiography and treatment guided by its result, compared with initial medical therapy without angiography, ranged between $17,000 and > $1 million per quality-adjusted year of life gained. Patient subgroups with severe postinfarction angina or a strongly positive exercise tolerance test (ETT) typically had cost-effectiveness ratios of < $50,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained. In addition, most patient subgroups with a prior AMI had cost-effectiveness ratios of < $50,000 per quality-adjusted year of life gained, even with a negative ETT result.

500,A cost-utility analysis of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. Docetaxel versus paclitaxel versus vinorelbine,"The aim of this study was to determine the incremental effectiveness, the incremental health-related quality of life (differences in quality-adjusted progression-free survival between treatments), the incremental cost and the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios, for docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine, when these drugs were used as second-line treatment in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In the absence of comparative direct evidence of the relative efficacy of docetaxel, paclitaxel and vinorelbine in this setting, a model was designed to determine the effects of the 3 interventions on health outcome and cost. A Markov process model, based on 53 disease states, was thus constructed to evaluate the socioeconomics of the 3 treatment regimens. The model allows assessments from the start of second-line chemotherapy until death. Costs were evaluated from the combined view of the healthcare system and the patient. Direct nonmedical and indirect costs were excluded. Consumption per episode of care was estimated by retrospective analysis of 153 medical reports from 5 different hospitals. Hospital costs were allocated values from the national accounting costs by diagnosis-related group (DRG). The content of the health states was based on the multiattribute health states classification system (MASH). Preference values were assigned by application of a standard reference lottery using 20 oncological nurses as proxies for the patients. The health-related quality-of-life score was used as a quality adjustment weighting factor to calculate quality-adjusted progression-free survival associated with the 3 different regimens. Docetaxel reduces the time spent in progression, decreases the number of complications due to progressive disease and thereby provides better quality of life. It provides a benefit of 57 disease- and discomfort-free days compared with vinorelbine and 22 days compared with paclitaxel. Docetaxel may be thought of as self-financing as a result of savings in hospital admissions, providing net savings of 6800 French francs (FF; 1993 values) compared with expenditure associated with vinorelbine treatment and FF700 compared with the equivalent figures for paclitaxel.",1996-01-01884,10169397,Pharmacoeconomics,R Launois,1996,10 / 5,504-21,Yes,10169397,"R Launois; J Reboul-Marty; B Henry; J Bonneterre; A cost-utility analysis of second-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.
