15301,Cost-Effectiveness of Treatments for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis: A French Societal Perspective,"OBJECTIVES: The paper aimed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) at the public published price for delayed-release dimethyl fumarate versus relevant Multiple Sclerosis disease-modifying therapies available in France in June 2015. METHODS: The economic model was adapted to the French setting in accordance with the Haute Autorite de Sante guidelines using a model previously developed for NICE. A cohort of Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients was simulated over a 30-year time horizon. Twenty one health states were taken into account: Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) 0-9 for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients, EDSS 0-9 for Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis patients, and death. Estimates of relative treatment efficacy were determined using a mixed-treatment comparison. Probabilities of events were derived from the dimethyl fumarate pivotal clinical trials and the London Ontario Dataset. Costs and utilities were extracted from the published literature from both the payer and societal perspectives. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of the model results. RESULTS: From both perspectives, dimethyl fumarate and interferon beta-1a (IFN beta-1a) 44mcg were the two optimal treatments, as the other treatments (IFN beta-1a 30mcg, IFN beta-1b 250mcg, teriflunomide, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod) were dominated on the efficiency frontier. From the societal perspective, dimethyl fumarate versus IFN beta-1a 44mcg incurred an incremental cost of euro3,684 and an incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of 0.281, corresponding to an ICER of euro13,110/QALY.

15307,Cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in people with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands,"AIMS: Up to 30% of insulin-treated type 2 diabetes patients are unable to achieve HbA1c targets despite optimization of insulin multiple daily injections (MDI). For these patients the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) represents a useful but under-utilized alternative. The aim of the present analysis was to examine the cost-effectiveness of initiating CSII in type 2 diabetes patients failing to achieve good glycemic control on MDI in the Netherlands. METHODS: Long-term projections were made using the IMS CORE Diabetes Model. Clinical input data were sourced from the OpT2mise trial. The analysis was performed over a lifetime time horizon. The discount rates applied to future costs and clinical outcomes were 4% and 1.5% per annum, respectively. RESULTS: CSII was associated with improved quality-adjusted life expectancy compared with MDI (9.38 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] vs 8.95 QALYs, respectively). The breakdown of costs indicated that approximately 50% of costs were attributable to diabetes-related complications. Higher acquisition costs of CSII vs MDI were partially offset by the reduction in complications. The ICER was estimated at EUR 62,895 per QALY gained and EUR 60,474 per QALY gained when indirect costs were included. CONCLUSIONS: In the Netherlands, CSII represents a cost-effective option in patients with type 2 diabetes who continue to have poorly-controlled HbA1c despite optimization of MDI. Since the ICER falls below the willingness-to-pay threshold of EUR 80,000 per QALY gained, CSII is likely to represent good-value for money in the treatment of poorly-controlled T2D patients compared with MDI.",2016-01-19867,26985982,J Med Econ,S Roze,2016,19 / 8,1-8,Yes,26985982,"S Roze; E Duteil; J Smith-Palmer; S de Portu; W Valentine; B F E de Brouwer; Y Reznik; H W de Valk; Cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in people with type 2 diabetes in the Netherlands, J Med Econ, 2016 Aug; 19(8):1369-6998; 1-8",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump vs. Standard/Usual Care- Multiple daily injections of insulin,Not Stated,Not Stated,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,4.00,1.50,62895,Euro,2013,92804.01
15308,Cost-Effectiveness of Capsaicin 8% Patch Compared with Pregabalin for the Treatment of Patients with Peripheral Neuropathic Pain in Scotland,"We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of capsaicin 8% patch (QUTENZA) versus pregabalin in patients with PNP from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and Personal and Social Services in Scotland, UK. A decision-tree cost-effectiveness model was developed for non-diabetic patients with peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP) who were pregabalin-naive and had not achieved adequate pain relief or tolerated conventional first- or second-line treatments. Patients entering the model received either a single application of capsaicin 8% patch or titrated daily dosing with pregabalin; after 8 weeks patients were classified as responders, non-responders, or were assumed to discontinue treatment due to intolerable adverse events. Responders continued to receive baseline treatment at intervals observed in clinical practice. Non-responders and those who discontinued treatment were assumed to receive last-line therapy (duloxetine). The base-case time horizon was 2 years. Model inputs for effectiveness, discontinuations and health-state utilities were taken from a head-to-head non-inferiority study (ELEVATE, NCT01713426). Other inputs were obtained from published sources or clinical expert opinion. Costs were expressed in GBP 2013/14. Results were presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), i.e. cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Model assumptions were tested with scenario analyses. Parameter uncertainty was tested using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Compared with dose-optimized pregabalin, capsaicin 8% patch was the dominant treatment strategy (total cost difference, - pound11; total QALY gain, 0.049). Capsaicin 8% patch was also the dominant treatment strategy versus pregabalin in 6 out of 7 scenario analyses. The model was most sensitive to variation in time to capsaicin 8% patch retreatment (maximum ICER, pound7,951/QALY at lower-bound 95% confidence interval). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000/QALY, the probability of capsaicin 8% patch being cost-effective versus pregabalin was 97%. Capsaicin 8% patch is a cost-effective treatment option compared with dose-optimized pregabalin in patients with PNP who have failed one or more previous systemic treatments.",2016-01-19875,26983018,PLoS One,Colette Mankowski,2016,11 / 3,e0150973,No,26983018,"Colette Mankowski; Sachin Patel; David Trueman; Anthony Bentley; Chris Poole; Cost-Effectiveness of Capsaicin 8% Patch Compared with Pregabalin for the Treatment of Patients with Peripheral Neuropathic Pain in Scotland, PLoS One , 2016; 11(3):1932-6203; e0150973",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Capsaicin vs. Pregabalin,Patients without diabetes,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.50,3.50,-224.49,United Kingdom,2014,-404.56

METHODS: We used a mathematical model to assess the cost-effectiveness of using the HIV Incidence Risk Index for MSM (HIRI-MSM) questionnaire to target PrEP to high-risk MSM. We simulated strategies of no PrEP, PrEP available to all MSM, and eligibility thresholds set to HIRI-MSM scores between 5 and 45, in increments of 5 (where a higher score predicts greater HIV risk). Based on the iPrEx, IPERGAY, and PROUD trials, we evaluated PrEP efficacies from 44% to 86% and annual costs from $5900 to 8700. We designate strategies with incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) </=$100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) as ""cost-effective."" RESULTS: Over 20 years, making PrEP available to all MSM is projected to prevent 33.5% of new HIV infections, with an ICER of $1,474,000/QALY. Increasing the HIRI-MSM score threshold reduces the prevented infections, but improves cost-effectiveness. A threshold score of 25 is projected to be optimal (most QALYs gained while still being cost-effective) over a wide range of realistic PrEP efficacies and costs. At low cost and high efficacy (IPERGAY), thresholds of 15 or 20 are optimal across a range of other input assumptions; at high cost and low efficacy (iPrEx), 25 or 30 are generally optimal.

OBJECTIVE: We examined the incremental cost-effectiveness of adding PCV13 to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) adult immunization schedule. METHODS: We used a probabilistic model following cohorts of 50-, 60-, or 65-year-olds. We used separate vaccination coverage and disease incidence data for healthy and high-risk adults. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were determined for each potential vaccination strategy. RESULTS: In the base case scenario, our model indicated that adding PCV13 at age 65 or replacing 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) at age 65 with PCV13 provided more value for money than adding PCV13 at ages 50 or 60. After projections of six additional years of herd protection from the childhood immunization program were incorporated, we found adding PCV13 dominated replacing PPSV23. For a cohort of 65-year-olds in 2013, the cost of adding PCV13 at age 65 to the schedule was $62,065 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, which rose to $272,621 after 6 years of projected herd protection.

15323,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Iodine-123 Meta-Iodobenzylguanidine Imaging for Screening Heart Failure Patients Eligible for an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator in the USA,"BACKGROUND: Many guideline-eligible heart failure (HF) patients do not receive a survival benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). Improved risk stratification may help to reduce costs and improve the cost effectiveness of ICDs. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the potential outcomes, costs, and cost effectiveness of using iodine-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (I-mIBG) to screen HF patients eligible for an ICD. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare screening with I-mIBG imaging and no screening over 2-year and 10-year time horizons from a US payer perspective. Data on I-mIBG imaging and risk stratification were obtained from the ADMIRE-HF/HFX (AdreView Myocardial Imaging for Risk Evaluation in Heart Failure) trial. Data on ICD effectiveness for prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) were obtained from a meta-analysis. Costs of ICDs and costs of generator and lead procedures were obtained from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality National Inpatient Sample. Age-specific mortality was modeled using US life tables and data from the ACT (Advancements in ICD Therapy) Registry on risks of SCD and non-SCD mortality. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the analysis, screening with I-mIBG imaging was associated with a reduction in ICD utilization of 21 %, resulting in a number needed to screen to prevent 1 ICD implantation of 5. Screening reduced the costs per patient by US$5500 and US$13,431 (in 2013 dollars) over 2 and 10 years, respectively, in comparison with no screening and resulted in losses of 0.001 and 0.040 life-years, respectively, over 2 and 10 years. Screening was decrementally cost effective, with savings of US$5,248,404 and US$513,036 per quality-adjusted life-year lost over 2 and 10 years, respectively. In subgroup analyses, cost savings were greater for patients with an ejection fraction (EF) of 25-35 % than for those with an EF <25 %.

15324,Cost-effectiveness of First-line Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatments When Full-dose Fludarabine Is Unsuitable,"PURPOSE: The cost-effectiveness of first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia treatments was assessed among patients unsuitable for full doses of fludarabine. METHODS: The study's key outcome was the life-time incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (euro/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] gained) with an annual 3% discounting. A probabilistic Markov model with 3 health states (progression-free, progression, and death) was developed. Survival time was modeled based on age-matched clinical data by using appropriate survival distributions. Each health state was assigned an EuroQoL-5D-3L quality-of-life estimate and Finnish payer costs according to treatment received, and Binet stage of disease; severe adverse events and treatment inconvenience were also included. Six approaches considered the risk and value of key outcomes: cost-effectiveness efficiency frontiers; Bayesian treatment ranking (BTR) rated the lowest ICERs and best QALY gains; the cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier demonstrated optimal treatment; expected value of perfect information; and the cost-benefit assessment (CBA), a type of clinical value analysis, increased the clinical interpretation and appeal of modeled outcomes by including both relative and absolute (impact investment [benefit obtained with a fixed limited budget]) benefit assessments. FINDINGS: The ICERs compared with chlorambucil varied from euro29,334 with obinutuzumab + chlorambucil to euro82,159 with ofatumumab + chlorambucil. Based on the BTR of ICERs versus chlorambucil, obinutuzumab + chlorambucil was the most cost-effective with 93% probability; rituximab + chlorambucil was the second most cost-effective (73%); and rituximab + bendamustine was the third most cost-effective (65%). The ICERs of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil were euro20,038, euro11,556, and euro15,586 compared with rituximab + chlorambucil, rituximab + bendamustine, and ofatumumab + chlorambucil. Obinutuzumab + chlorambucil was the most cost-effective treatment, with 54% and 99% probability at euro30,000 and euro50,000/QALY gained, respectively. The corresponding expected values of perfect information were euro1438 and euro44 per patient. Based on the BTR of QALYs gained, obinutuzumab + chlorambucil was the most effective, with 100% probability; rituximab + chlorambucil was the second most effective (56%); and rituximab + bendamustine was the third most effective treatment (81%). Results were robust in sensitivity analyses. For obinutuzumab + chlorambucil, the CBA demonstrated the best clinical value-to-cost-effectiveness relation and the longest time progression-free with a limited budget.

15331,Arthroplasty for the surgical management of complex proximal humerus fractures in the elderly: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Shoulder hemiarthroplasty (HA) has been the standard treatment for complex proximal humerus fractures in the elderly requiring surgery but not amenable to fixation. Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) has also emerged as a costly albeit highly effective alternative. The purpose of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of nonoperative fracture care, HA, and RTSA for complex proximal humerus fractures from the perspective of both U.S. payors and hospitals. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed for the treatment alternatives. Costs were expressed in 2013 U.S. dollars and effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The principal outcome measure was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model assumptions. RESULTS: In the base case, from the payor perspective, RTSA was associated with an ICER of $8100/QALY; HA was eliminated from payor analysis as a cost-ineffective strategy. From the hospital perspective, however, HA was not cost-ineffective and the ICER for HA was $36,700/QALY, with RTSA providing incremental effectiveness at $57,400/QALY. RTSA was the optimal strategy in 61% and 54% of payor and hospital probabilistic sensitivity analyses, respectively. The preferred strategy was dependent on associated QALY gains, primary RTSA cost, and failure rates for RTSA. CONCLUSIONS: RTSA can be a cost-effective intervention in the surgical treatment of complex proximal humerus fractures. HA can also be a cost-effective intervention, depending on the cost perspective (cost-ineffective for payor but cost-effective for the hospital).

15333,Cost Effectiveness of Protease Inhibitor Monotherapy Versus Standard Triple Therapy in the Long-Term Management of HIV Patients: Analysis Using Evidence from the PIVOT Trial,"BACKGROUND: Protease inhibitor (PI) monotherapy can maintain virological suppression in the majority of patients once it has been established on triple therapy and may also have the potential for substantial cost savings arising from the use of fewer drugs. However, the cost effectiveness of PI monotherapy has yet to be demonstrated. OBJECTIVES: In this study we examine the cost effectiveness of PI monotherapy with prompt return to combination therapy in the event of viral load rebound compared with ongoing triple therapy (OT) in patients with suppressed viral load on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the UK. METHODS: The analysis used data from the PIVOT trial in which HIV-positive adults with suppressed viral load for >/=24 weeks on combination ART were randomised to maintain OT or to a strategy of PI monotherapy with prompt return to combination therapy if viral load rebounded. A cost-effectiveness analysis including long-term modelling was conducted. Main outcomes included UK National Health Service (NHS) costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) with comparative results presented as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: PI monotherapy was cost saving as a result of large savings in ART drug costs while being no less effective in terms of QALYs in the within-trial analysis and marginally less effective with lifetime modelling. In the base-case analysis over 3 years, the incremental total cost per patient was - pound6424.11 (95 % confidence interval -7418.84 to -5429.38) and incremental QALYs were 0.0051 (95 % CI -0.0479 to 0.0582), resulting in PI monotherapy ''dominating'' OT. Multiple scenario analyses found that PI monotherapy was cost saving with no marked differences in QALYs. Modelling of lifetime costs and QALYs showed that PI monotherapy was associated with significant cost savings and was marginally less effective; PI monotherapy was cost effective at accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds in all but one scenario analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Under most assumptions, PI monotherapy appears to be a cost-effective treatment strategy compared with OT for HIV-infected patients who have achieved sustained virological suppression.",2016-01-19908,26966125,Pharmacoeconomics,Lars Oddershede,2016,34 / 8,,Yes,26966125,"Lars Oddershede; Simon Walker; Wolfgang Stohr; David T Dunn; Alejandro Arenas-Pinto; Nicholas I Paton; Mark Sculpher; Protease Inhibitor monotherapy V; Cost Effectiveness of Protease Inhibitor Monotherapy Versus Standard Triple Therapy in the Long-Term Management of HIV Patients: Analysis Using Evidence from the PIVOT Trial, Pharmacoeconomics, 2016 Aug; 34(8):1179-2027",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Protease inhibitor monotherapy vs. Ongoing triple therapy [antiretroviral therapy (ART), usually consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) combined with a third drug: either a non-NRTI (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI) or an integrase inhibitor ]","taking stable combination ART with no change in the 12 weeks prior to screening, who hada viral load \50 copies/mL at and for at least 24 weeks before screening, and who had a CD4+ cell count >100 cells/mm3 at screening",Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Years,3.50,3.50,292179,United Kingdom,2012,522142.82

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DES in comparison with bare-metal stents (BMS) for treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). DESIGN: Markov model. DATA SOURCES: Published literature, government database, and CAD patient cohort. TARGET POPULATION: Single-vessel CAD patients. TIME HORIZON: One year and lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Brazilian Public Health System (SUS). INTERVENTION: Six strategies composed of percutaneous intervention with a BMS or 1 of 5 DES (paclitaxel, sirolimus, everolimus, zotarolimus, and zotarolimus resolute). OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost for target vessel revascularization avoided and cost for quality-adjusted life year gained. BASE CASE ANALYSIS: In the short-term analysis, sirolimus was the most effective and least costly among DES (ICER of I$20,642 per target vessel revascularization avoided), with all others DES dominated by sirolimus. Lifetime cumulative costs ranged from I$18,765 to I$21,400. In the base case analysis, zotarolimus resolute had the most favorable ICER among the DES (ICER I$62,761), with sirolimus, paclitaxel, and zotarolimus being absolute dominated and everolimus extended dominated by zotarolimus resolute, although all the results were above the willingness-to-pay threshold of 3 times the gross domestic product per capita (I$35,307).

15339,Cost effectiveness comparison of dutasteride and finasteride in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia--The Markov model based on data from Montenegro,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is one of the most common disease among males aging 50 years and more. The rise of the prevalence of BPH is related to aging, and since duration of life time period has the tendency of rising the prevalence of BPH will rise as costs of BPH treatment will and its influence on health economic budget. Dutasteride is a new drug similar to finasteride, inhibits enzyme testosterone 5-alpha reductase, diminish symptoms of BPH, reduce risk of the complications and increases quality of life in patients with BPH. But, the use of dutasteride is limited by its high costs. The aim of this study was to compare cost effectiveness of dutasteride and finasteride from the perspective of a purchaser of health care service (Republic Institute for Health Insuranse, Montenegro). METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to compare cost effectivenss of dutasteride and finasteride using data from the available pharmacoeconomic literature and data about socioeconomic sphere actual in Montenegro. A time horizon was estimated to be 20 years, with the duration of 1 year per one cycle. The discount rate was 3%. We performed Monte Carlo simulation for virtual cohort of 1,000 patients with BPH. RESULTS: The total costs for one year treatment of BPH with dutasteride were estimated to be 6,458.00 euro which was higher comparing with finasteride which were 6,088.56 euro. The gain in quality adjusted life years (QALY) were higher with dutasteride (11.97 QALY) than with finasteride (11.19 QALY). The results of our study indicate that treating BPH with dutasteride comparing to finasteride is a cost effective option since the value of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is 1,245.68 euro/QALY which is below estimated threshold (1,350.00 euro per one gained year of life). CONCLUSION: Dutasteride is a cost effective option for treating BPH comparing to finasteride.

15340,Long-Term Cost-Effectiveness of Insulin Glargine Versus Neutral Protamine Hagedorn Insulin for Type 2 Diabetes in Thailand,"BACKGROUND: Even though Insulin glargine (IGlar) has been available and used in other countries for more than a decade, it has not been adopted into Thai national formulary. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term cost effectiveness of IGlar versus neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin in type 2 diabetes from the perspective of Thai Health Care System. METHODS: A validated computer simulation model (the IMS CORE Diabetes Model) was used to estimate the long-term projection of costs and clinical outcomes. The model was populated with published characteristics of Thai patients with type 2 diabetes. Baseline risk factors were obtained from Thai cohort studies, while relative risk reduction was derived from a meta-analysis study conducted by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technology in Health. Only direct costs were taken into account. Costs of diabetes management and complications were obtained from hospital databases in Thailand. Both costs and outcomes were discounted at 3 % per annum and presented in US dollars in terms of 2014 dollar value. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: IGlar is associated with a slight gain in quality-adjusted life years (0.488 QALYs), an additional life expectancy (0.677 life years), and an incremental cost of THB119,543 (US$3522.19) compared with NPH insulin. The ICERs were THB244,915/QALY (US$7216.12/QALY) and THB176,525/life-year gained (LYG) (US$5201.09/LYG). The ICER was sensitive to discount rates and IGlar cost.

15341,COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENTS FOR MILD-TO-MODERATE OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA IN FRANCE,"OBJECTIVES: Untreated obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is associated with excessive daytime sleepiness, increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease, and road traffic accidents (RTAs), which impact survival and health-related quality of life. This study, funded by the French National Authority for Health (HAS), aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of different treatments (i.e., continuous positive airway pressure [CPAP], dental devices, lifestyle advice, and no treatment) in patients with mild-to-moderate OSAHS in France. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the progression of two cohorts, stratified by CV risk, over a lifetime horizon. Daytime sleepiness and RTAs were taken into account for all patients while CV events were only considered for patients with high CV risk. RESULTS: For patients with low CV risk, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of dental devices versus no treatment varied between 32,976 EUR (moderate OSAHS) and 45,579 EUR (mild OSAHS) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and CPAP versus dental devices, above 256,000 EUR/QALY. For patients with high CV risk, CPAP was associated with a gain of 0.62 QALY compared with no treatment, resulting in an ICER of 10,128 EUR/QALY. CONCLUSION: The analysis suggests that it is efficient to treat all OSAHS patients with high CV risk with CPAP and that dental devices are more efficient than CPAP for mild-to-moderate OSAHS with low CV risk.

15343,Cost-effectiveness analysis of peginterferon beta-1a compared with interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate in the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in the United States,"Objective Peginterferon beta-1a 125 mcg, administered subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks, a new disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2014. This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of peginterferon beta-1a vs interferon beta-1a (44 mcg SC 3 times per week) and glatiramer acetate (20 mg SC once-daily) in the treatment of RRMS from the perspective of a US payer over 10 years. Methods A Markov cohort economic model was developed for this analysis. The model predicts disability progression, occurrence of relapses and other adverse events and translates them into quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. Natural history data were obtained from the placebo arm of the ADVANCE trial of peginterferon beta-1a, the London Ontario (Canada) database and a large population-based MS survey. Comparative efficacy of each DMT vs placebo was obtained from a network meta-analysis. Costs (in 2014 US dollars) were sourced from public databases and literature. Clinical and economic outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Results Over 10 years, peginterferon beta-1a was dominant (i.e., more effective and less costly), with cost-savings of $22,070 and additional 0.06 QALYs when compared with interferon beta-1a 44 mcg and with cost-savings of $19,163 and 0.07 QALYs gained when compared with glatiramer acetate 20 mg. Results were most sensitive to variations in the treatment effect of each DMT, treatment acquisition costs of each DMT and the time horizon. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that peginterferon beta-1a remains dominant in >90% of 5,000 replications compared with either DMTs.

15345,A cost-utility analysis for catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation in combination with warfarin and dabigatran based on the CHADS2 score in Japan,"BACKGROUND: We aimed to clarify the cost-effectiveness of an expensive combination therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF) using both catheter ablation and dabigatran compared with warfarin at each CHADS2 score for patients in Japan. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to analyze costs and quality-adjusted life years associated with AF therapeutic options with a time horizon of 10 years. The target population was 60-year-old patients with paroxysmal AF. The indication for anticoagulation was determined according to the Japanese guideline. Anticoagulation-related data were derived from the RE-LY study and the AF recurrence rate was set at 2.7% per month during the first 12 months and at 0.40% per month afterwards. Stroke risk was determined according to AF recurrence, anticoagulation, and CHADS2 score. The risks for stroke recurrence and stroke death were also considered. Costs were calculated from the healthcare payer''s perspective, and only direct medical costs were included. RESULTS: Warfarin was the most preferred option for patients with a CHADS2 score of 0 from a health economics aspect. Ablation under warfarin was preferred for a CHADS2 score of 1-3, while ablation under dabigatran was preferred for a CHADS2 score >/=4. The quality of life score for AF had the largest impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in the analysis between the anticoagulation arm and the anticoagulation+ablation arm for a CHADS2 score of 2. Within the range of the Japanese willingness-to-pay threshold ( yen5,000,000), the ablation+warfarin arm became the best option with its probability of 81.7% for a CHADS2 score of 2; the dabigatran+ablation arm was the most preferred option with its probability of 56.1% for a CHADS2 score of 4.

15348,Cost-effectiveness of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Treatment Strategies for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase After Generic Entry of Imatinib in the United States,"BACKGROUND: We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of treating incident chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CML-CP) with generic imatinib when it becomes available in United States in 2016. In the year following generic entry, imatinib''s price is expected to drop 70% to 90%. We hypothesized that initiating treatment with generic imatinib in these patients and then switching to the other tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), dasatinib or nilotinib, because of intolerance or lack of effectiveness (""imatinib-first"") would be cost-effective compared with the current standard of care: ""physicians'' choice"" of initiating treatment with any one of the three TKIs. METHODS: We constructed Markov models to compare the five-year cost-effectiveness of imatinib-first vs physician''s choice from a US commercial payer perspective, assuming 3% annual discounting ($US 2013). The models'' clinical endpoint was five-year overall survival taken from a systematic review of clinical trial results. Per-person spending on incident CML-CP treatment overall care components was estimated using Truven''s MarketScan claims data. The main outcome of the models was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). We interpreted outcomes based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000/QALY. A panel of European LeukemiaNet experts oversaw the study''s conduct. RESULTS: Both strategies met the threshold. Imatinib-first ($277 401, 3.87 QALYs) offered patients a 0.10 decrement in QALYs at a savings of $88 343 over five years to payers compared with physician''s choice ($365 744, 3.97 QALYs). The imatinib-first incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was approximately $883 730/QALY. The results were robust to multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: When imatinib loses patent protection and its price declines, its use will be the cost-effective initial treatment strategy for CML-CP.",2016-01-19956,26944912,J Natl Cancer Inst,William V Padula,2016,108 / 7,,No,26944912,"William V Padula; Richard A Larson; Stacie B Dusetzina; Jane F Apperley; Rudiger Hehlmann; Michele Baccarani; Ekkehard Eigendorff; Joelle Guilhot; Francois Guilhot; Francois-Xavier Mahon; Giovanni Martinelli; Jiri Mayer; Martin C Muller; Dietger Niederwieser; Susanne Saussele; Charles A Schiffer; Richard T Silver; Bengt Simonsson; Rena M Conti; Cost-effectiveness of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Treatment Strategies for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia in Chronic Phase After Generic Entry of Imatinib in the United States, J Natl Cancer Inst, 2016 Jul; 108(7):0027-8874",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Initiating treatment with generic imatinib in patients and then switching to the other tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) vs. Standard/Usual Care- physician's choice,in Chronic Phase After Generic Entry of Imatinib,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,883730,United States,2013,981807.99
15349,Cost-Effectiveness of Five Commonly Used Prosthesis Brands for Total Knee Replacement in the UK: A Study Using the NJR Dataset,"BACKGROUND: There is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of alternative brands of prosthesis for total knee replacement (TKR). We compared patient-reported outcomes, revision rates, and costs, and estimated the relative cost-effectiveness of five frequently used cemented brands of unconstrained prostheses with fixed bearings (PFC Sigma, AGC Biomet, Nexgen, Genesis 2, and Triathlon). METHODS: We used data from three national databases for patients who had a TKR between 2003 and 2012, to estimate the effect of prosthesis brand on post-operative quality of life (QOL) (EQ-5D-3L) in 53 126 patients at six months. We compared TKR revision rates by brand over 10 years for 239 945 patients. We used a fully probabilistic Markov model to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs), and the probability that each prosthesis brand is the most cost effective at alternative thresholds of willingness-to-pay for a QALY gain. FINDINGS: Revision rates were lowest with the Nexgen and PFC Sigma (2.5% after 10 years in 70-year-old women). Average lifetime costs were lowest with the AGC Biomet ( pound9 538); mean post-operative QOL was highest with the Nexgen, which was the most cost-effective brand across all patient subgroups. For example, for 70-year-old men and women, the ICERs for the Nexgen compared to the AGC Biomet were pound2 300 per QALY. At realistic cost per QALY thresholds ( pound10 000 to pound30 000), the probabilities that the Nexgen is the most cost-effective brand are about 98%. These results were robust to alternative modelling assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: AGC Biomet prostheses are the least costly cemented unconstrained fixed brand for TKR but Nexgen prostheses lead to improved patient outcomes, at low additional cost.

In settings where screening with anal cytology is unavailable, regular anal examinations have been proposed in some guidelines but their cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: Our objective was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of regular anal examinations to screen for anal cancer in HIV-positive MSM living in Australia using a probabilistic Markov model. Data sources were based on the medical literature and a clinical trial of HIV-positive MSM receiving an annual anal examination in Australia. The main outcome measures for calculating effectiveness were undiscounted and discounted (at 3%) lifetime costs, life years gained, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Base-case analysis estimated the average cost of screening for and management of anal cancer ranged from $195 for no screening to $1,915 for lifetime annual screening of men aged >/= 50. Screening of men aged >/= 50 generated ICERs of $29,760 per QALY gained (for screening every four years), $32,222 (every three years) and $45,484 (every two years). Uncertainty for ICERs was mostly influenced by the cost (financially and decrease in quality of life) from a false-positive result, progression rate of anal cancer, specificity of the anal examination, the probability of detection outside a screening program and the discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for anal cancer by incorporating regular anal examinations into routine HIV care for MSM aged >/= 50 is most likely to be cost-effective by conventional standards.

15361,Early Treatment in HIV Patients: A Cost-Utility Analysis from the Italian Perspective,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has modified the clinical course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, reducing the rate of disease progression, the incidence of opportunistic infections and mortality. Several recent studies show early antiretroviral therapy reduces the risk of AIDS and HIV-related disease. The aim of this study was to perform an economic analysis to estimate the cost-utility of early antiretroviral therapy in Italy for managing HIV-infected patients. METHODS: The incremental cost-utility analysis was carried out to quantify the benefits of the early-treatment approach in HIV subjects. A Markov simulation model including direct costs and health outcomes was developed from a third-party (Italian National Healthcare Service) payer''s perspective for four CD4 strata. 5000 Monte Carlo simulations were performed on two distinct scenarios: Standard of care (SoC) in which 30% of patients started HAART with a CD4 count >/=500 cells/mm(3) versus the early-treatment scenario (ETS), where the number of patients starting HAART with a CD4 count >/=500 cells/mm(3) increased to 70%. A systematic literature review was carried out to identify epidemiological and economic data, which were subsequently used to inform the model. In addition, a one-way probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed in order to measure the relationship between the effectiveness of the treatments and the number of patients to undergo early treatment. RESULTS: The model shows, in terms of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained, that early treatment appeared to be the most cost-effective option compared to SoC (ICER = euro13,625) over a time horizon of 10 years. The cost effectiveness of ETS is more sustainable as it extends the time horizon analysis (ICER = euro7526 per QALY to 20 years and euro8382 per QALY to 30 years). The one-way sensitivity analysis on the main variables confirmed the robustness of the model for the early-treatment approach. CONCLUSION: Our model represents a tool for policy makers and health-care professionals to provide information on the cost effectiveness of the early-treatment approach in HIV-infected patients in Italy. Starting HAART earlier keeps HIV-infected patients in better health and reduces the incidence of AIDS- and non-AIDS-related events, generating a gain in terms of both patients'' health and correct resource allocation.",2016-01-19962,26940802,Clin Drug Investig,Andrea Marcellusi,2016,36 / 5,377-87,Yes,26940802,"Andrea Marcellusi; Raffaella Viti; Simone Russo; Massimo Andreoni; Andrea Antinori; Francesco Saverio Mennini; Early Treatment in HIV Patients: A Cost-Utility Analysis from the Italian Perspective, Clin Drug Investig, 2016 May; 36(5):1173-2563; 377-87",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy for patients with <500 CD4 count vs. Standard/Usual Care,patients in early-treatment,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,19925,Euro,2014,28964.16
15362,Overtreatment and Cost-Effectiveness of the See-and-Treat Strategy for Managing Cervical Precancer,"BACKGROUND: See-and-treat using loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) has been recommended as an alternative in managing high-grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions, but existing literature lacks evidence of the strategy''s cost-effectiveness. We evaluated the overtreatment and cost-effectiveness of the see-and-treat strategy compared with usual care. METHODS: We modeled a hypothetical cohort of 40-year-old females who had not been screened for cervical cancer and followed them through their lifetimes using a Markov model. From a U.S. health-system perspective, the analysis was conducted in 2012 dollars and measured effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). We estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/QALY. The robustness of the see-and-treat strategy''s cost-effectiveness and its overtreatment rates were further examined in various sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case, the see-and-treat strategy yielded an ICER of $70,774/QALY compared with usual care. For most scenarios in the deterministic sensitivity analysis, this strategy had ICERs larger than $50,000/QALY, and its cost-effectiveness was sensitive to the disutility of LEEP treatment and biopsy-directed treatment adherence under usual care. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the see-and-treat strategy had a 50.1% chance to be cost-effective. It had an average overtreatment rate of 7.1% and a 78.8% chance to have its overtreatment rate lower than the 10% threshold. CONCLUSION: The see-and-treat strategy induced an acceptable overtreatment rate. Its cost-effectiveness, compared with usual care, was indiscriminating at the chosen willingness-to-pay threshold but much improved when the threshold increased. IMPACT: The see-and-treat strategy was reasonable for particular settings, that is, those with low treatment adherence. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(5); 807-14.

15363,Clinical and economic consequences of using dabigatran or rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Atrial fibrillation is a supraventricular arrhythmia that increases the risk of ischemic stroke and other thromboembolic events. Recently new treatment options have emerged whose cost-effectiveness relative to conventional therapy (warfarin) is well demonstrated. This study compares the clinical benefits and economic costs associated with the new oral anticoagulants most used in Portugal: dabigatran and rivaroxaban. METHODS: The results of an indirect comparison of the RE-LY and ROCKET AF trials, which enabled differences in the efficacy of dabigatran and rivaroxaban to be determined, were used in a Markov model simulating patient outcomes in terms of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, transient ischemic attack, systemic embolism, acute myocardial infarction and intra- and extracranial bleeding. RESULTS: The use of dabigatran is associated with better clinical results. The reduction in events is reflected in longer survival (8.41 vs. 8.26 years) and more quality-adjusted life years (5.87 vs. 5.74), while the lower daily treatment cost and the reduction in event-related costs lead to a saving of 367 euros per patient from a societal perspective. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that dabigatran is a dominant alternative, i.e., it produces better clinical results at a lower cost. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the results are robust even considering the uncertainty inherent in an indirect comparison. It can thus be concluded that in clinical practice in Portugal the use of dabigatran is to be preferred to the use of rivaroxaban.",2016-01-19980,26928016,Rev Port Cardiol,Luis Silva Miguel,2016,35 / 3,141-148,No,26928016,"Luis Silva Miguel; Jorge Ferreira; Clinical and economic consequences of using dabigatran or rivaroxaban in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, Rev Port Cardiol, 2016 Mar; 35(3):0870-2551; 141-148",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,treatment with Dabigatran vs. treatment with Rivaroxaban,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-2823.08,Euro,2013,-4165.56
15364,Cost Effectiveness Analysis of Different Management Strategies between Best Supportive Care and Second-line Chemotherapy for Platinum-resistant or Refractory Ovarian Cancer,"BACKGROUND: There is no standard treatment for patients with platinum-resistant or refractory epithelial ovarian cancer. Single agent chemotherapies have evidence of more efficacy and less toxicity than combination therapy. Most are very expensive, with appreciable toxicity and minimal survival. Since it is difficult to make comparison between outcomes, economic analysis of single-agent chemotherapy regimens and best supportive care may help to make decisions about an appropriate management for the affected patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of second-line chemotherapy compared with best supportive care for patients with platinum-resistant or refractory epithelial ovarian cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was used to estimate the effectiveness and total costs associated with treatments. The hypothetical patient population comprised women aged 55 with platinum-resistant or refractory epithelial ovarian cancer. Four types of alternative treatment options were evaluated: 1) gemcitabine followed by BSC; 2) pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) followed by BSC; 3) gemcitabine followed by topotecan; and 4) PLD followed by topotecan. Baseline comparator of alternative treatments was BSC. Time horizon of the analysis was 2 years. Health care provider perspective and 3% discount rate were used to determine the costs of medical treatment in this study. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were used to measure the treatment effectiveness. Treatment effectiveness data were derived from the literature. Costs were calculated from unit cost treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer patients at various stages of disease in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital (KCMH) in the year 2011. Parameter uncertainty was tested in probabilistic sensitivity analysis by using Monte Carlo simulation. One-way sensitivity analysis was used to explore each variable's impact on the uncertainty of the results. RESULTS: Approximated life expectancy of best supportive care was 0.182 years and its total cost was 26,862 Baht. All four alternative treatments increased life expectancy. Life expectancy of gemcitabine followed by BSC, PLD followed by BSC, gemcitabine followed by topotecan and PLD followed by topotecan was 0.510, 0.513, 0.566, and 0.570 years, respectively. The total cost of gemcitabine followed by BSC, PLD followed by BSC, gemcitabine followed by topotecan and PLD followed by topotecan was 113,000, 124,302, 139,788 and 151,135 Baht, respectively. PLD followed by topotecan had the highest expected quality-adjusted life-years but was the most expensive of all the above strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of gemcitabine followed by BSC, PLD followed by BSC, gemcitabine followed by topotecan and PLD followed by topotecan was 344,643, 385,322, 385,856, and 420,299 Baht, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: All of the second-line chemotherapy strategies showed certain benefits due to an increased life- year gained compared with best supportive care. Moreover, gemcitabine as second-line chemotherapy followed by best supportive care in progressive disease case was likely to be more effective strategy with less cost from health care provider perspective.

15368,Reverse-total shoulder arthroplasty cost-effectiveness: A quality-adjusted life years comparison with total hip arthroplasty,"AIM: To compare reverse-total shoulder arthroplasty (RSA) cost-effectiveness with total hip arthroplasty cost-effectiveness. METHODS: This study used a stochastic model and decision-making algorithm to compare the cost-effectiveness of RSA and total hip arthroplasty. Fifteen patients underwent pre-operative, and 3, 6, and 12 mo post-operative clinical examinations and Short Form-36 Health Survey completion. Short form-36 Health Survey subscale scores were converted to EuroQual Group Five Dimension Health Outcome scores and compared with historical data from age-matched patients who had undergone total hip arthroplasty. Quality-adjusted life year (QALY) improvements based on life expectancies were calculated. RESULTS: The cost/QALY was $3900 for total hip arthroplasty and $11100 for RSA. After adjusting the model to only include shoulder-specific physical function subscale items, the RSA QALY improved to 2.8 years, and its cost/QALY decreased to $8100. CONCLUSION: Based on industry accepted standards, cost/QALY estimates supported both RSA and total hip arthroplasty cost-effectiveness.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the pharmacoeconomic effect of 6 months of treatment with apixaban versus other anticoagulants over a lifetime horizon. Network meta-analyses were conducted using the results of the Apixaban after the Initial Management of Pulmonary Embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis with First-Line Therapy (AMPLIFY), EINSTEIN-pooled, and RE-COVER I and II trials for the following end points: recurrent VTE, major bleeds, clinically relevant non-major bleeds, and treatment discontinuations.

IMPLICATIONS: The assessment of the effects and costs of apixaban in this study predicted that apixaban is a dominant alternative to rivaroxaban and LMWH/dabigatran and a cost-effective alternative to LMWH/VKA for 6 months of treatment of VTE and the prevention of recurrence.",2016-01-19994,26922297,Clin Ther,Tereza Lanitis,2016,38 / 3,478-493.e16,Yes,26922297,"Tereza Lanitis; Robert Leipold; Melissa Hamilton; Dale Rublee; Peter Quon; Chantelle Browne; Alexander T Cohen; Cost-effectiveness of Apixaban Versus Other Oral Anticoagulants for the Initial Treatment of Venous Thromboembolism and Prevention of Recurrence, Clin Ther, 2016 Mar; 38(3):1879-114X; 478-493.e16",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,6 month treatment with Apixaban vs. 6 month treatment with Low-molecular-weight Heparin/Vitamin K Antagonist,Not Stated,64 Years,41 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,2520,United Kingdom,2012,4503.4
15372,Cost-Effectiveness of Vaccinating Immunocompetent >/=65 Year Olds with the 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in England,"BACKGROUND: Recently a large clinical trial showed that the use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) among immunocompetent individuals aged 65 years and over was safe and efficacious. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating immunocompetent 65 year olds with PCV13 vaccine in England. England is a country with universal childhood pneumococcal conjugate vaccination programme in place (7-valent (PCV7) since 2006 and PCV13 since 2010), as well as a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide (PPV23) vaccination programme targeting clinical risk-groups and those >/=65 years. METHOD: A static cohort cost-effectiveness model was developed to follow a cohort of 65 year olds until death, which will be vaccinated in the autumn of 2016 with PCV13. Sensitivity analysis was performed to test the robustness of the results. RESULTS: The childhood vaccination programme with PCV7 has induced herd protection among older unvaccinated age groups, with a resultant low residual disease burden caused by PCV7 vaccine types. We show similar herd protection effects for the 6 additional serotypes included in PCV13, and project a new low post-introduction equilibrium of vaccine-type disease in 2018/19. Applying these incidence projections for both invasive disease and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), and using recent measures of vaccine efficacy against these endpoints for >/=65 year olds, we estimate that vaccination of a cohort of immunocompetent 65 year olds with PCV13 would directly prevent 26 cases of IPD, 69 cases of CAP and 15 deaths. The associated cost-effectiveness ratio is pound257,771 per QALY gained (using list price of pound49.10 per dose and pound7.51 administration costs) and is therefore considered not cost-effective. To obtain a cost-effective programme the price per dose would need to be negative. The results were sensitive to disease incidence, waning vaccine protection and case fatality rate; despite this, the overall conclusion was robust. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccinating immunocompetent individuals aged >/=65 years with PCV13 is efficacious. However the absolute incidence of vaccine-type disease will likely become very low due to wider benefits of the childhood PCV13 vaccination programme, such that a specific PCV13 vaccination programme targeting the immunocompetent elderly would not be cost-effective.",2016-01-20006,26914907,PLoS One,Albert Jan van Hoek,2016,11 / 2,e0149540,No,26914907,"Albert Jan van Hoek; Elizabeth Miller; Cost-Effectiveness of Vaccinating Immunocompetent >/=65 Year Olds with the 13-Valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in England, PLoS One , 2016; 11(2):1932-6203; e0149540",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Vaccination of a cohort of immunocompetent 65 year olds with PCV13 vs. None,"This cohort comprised immunocompetent individuals including those with co-morbidities such as diabetes, asthma, splenectomy or heart, liver or lung disease.",65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"4 Years, Lifetime",3.50,3.50,257771,United Kingdom,2014,464541.33

15376,InnovaSEC in Action: Cost-effectiveness of Barostim in the Treatment of Refractory Hypertension in Spain,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: In Spain, 0.3% of patients with hypertension are refractory to conventional treatment. The complications resulting from deficient control of this condition can lead to poor quality of life for the patient and considerable health care costs. Barostim is an implantable device designed to lower blood pressure in these patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of Barostim compared with drug therapy in hypertensive patients refractory to conventional treatment (at least 3 antihypertensive drugs, including 1 diuretic agent). METHODS: We used a Markov model adapted to the epidemiology of the Spanish population to simulate the natural history of a cohort of patients with refractory hypertension over their lifetime. Data on the effectiveness of the treatments studied were obtained from the literature, and data on costs were taken from hospital administrative databases and official sources. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Barostim increased the number of quality-adjusted life years by 0.78 and reduced the number of hypertension-associated clinical events. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in a cohort of men reached 68 726 euros per year of quality-adjusted life. One of the main elements that makes this technology costly is the need for battery replacement. The results were robust. CONCLUSIONS: Barostim is not a cost-effective strategy for the treatment of refractory hypertension in Spain.

15377,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Risk Stratification of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) by the Primary Care Physician Using the NAFLD Fibrosis Score,"BACKGROUND: The complications of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) are dependent on the presence of advanced fibrosis. Given the high prevalence of NAFLD in the US, the optimal evaluation of NAFLD likely involves triage by a primary care physician (PCP) with advanced disease managed by gastroenterologists. METHODS: We compared the cost-effectiveness of fibrosis risk-assessment strategies in a cohort of 10,000 simulated American patients with NAFLD performed in either PCP or referral clinics using a decision analytical microsimulation state-transition model. The strategies included use of vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE), the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), combination testing with NFS and VCTE, and liver biopsy (usual care by a specialist only). NFS and VCTE performance was obtained from a prospective cohort of 164 patients with NAFLD. Outcomes included cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) and correct classification of fibrosis. RESULTS: Risk-stratification by the PCP using the NFS alone costs $5,985 per QALY while usual care costs $7,229/QALY. In the microsimulation, at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000, the NFS alone in PCP clinic was the most cost-effective strategy in 94.2% of samples, followed by combination NFS/VCTE in the PCP clinic (5.6%) and usual care in 0.2%. The NFS based strategies yield the best biopsy-correct classification ratios (3.5) while the NFS/VCTE and usual care strategies yield more correct-classifications of advanced fibrosis at the cost of 3 and 37 additional biopsies per classification.

15383,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Six Strategies to Treat Recurrent Clostridium difficile Infection,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of six treatment strategies for patients diagnosed with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) in Canada: 1. oral metronidazole; 2. oral vancomycin; 3.oral fidaxomicin; 4. fecal transplantation by enema; 5. fecal transplantation by nasogastric tube; and 6. fecal transplantation by colonoscopy. PERSPECTIVE: Public insurer for all hospital and physician services. SETTING: Ontario, Canada. METHODS: A decision analytic model was used to model costs and lifetime health effects of each strategy for a typical patient experiencing up to three recurrences, over 18 weeks. Recurrence data and utilities were obtained from published sources. Cost data was obtained from published sources and hospitals in Toronto, Canada. The willingness-to-pay threshold was $50,000/QALY gained. RESULTS: Fecal transplantation by colonoscopy dominated all other strategies in the base case, as it was less costly and more effective than all alternatives. After accounting for uncertainty in all model parameters, there was an 87% probability that fecal transplantation by colonoscopy was the most beneficial strategy. If colonoscopy was not available, fecal transplantation by enema was cost-effective at $1,708 per QALY gained, compared to metronidazole. In addition, fecal transplantation by enema was the preferred strategy if the probability of recurrence following this strategy was below 8.7%. If fecal transplantation by any means was unavailable, fidaxomicin was cost-effective at an additional cost of $25,968 per QALY gained, compared to metronidazole. CONCLUSION: Fecal transplantation by colonoscopy (or enema, if colonoscopy is unavailable) is cost-effective for treating recurrent CDI in Canada.

METHODS: The European Erlotinib versus Chemotherapy study was a multicenter, open-label, randomized phase III trial performed mainly in Spain, France, and Italy. We based our economic analysis on clinical data and data on resource consumption (drugs, drug administration, adverse events, and second-line treatments) collected during this trial. Utility values were derived from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated for the first-line treatment phase and for the overall strategy from the perspective of the three participating countries. Sensitivity analyses were performed by selecting the main cost drivers. RESULTS: Compared with standard first-line chemotherapy, the first-line treatment with erlotinib was cost saving (euro7807, euro17,311, and euro19,364 for Spain, Italy and France, respectively) and yielded a gain of 0.117 quality-adjusted life-years. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that, given a willingness to pay at least euro90,000 for 1 quality-adjusted life-year, the probability that a strategy of first-line erlotinib would be cost-effective was 100% in France, 100% in Italy, and 99.8% in Spain.

15387,"Impact and cost-effectiveness of a second tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine dose to prevent pertussis in the United States","INTRODUCTION: The United States experienced a substantial increase in reported pertussis cases over the last decade. Since 2005, persons 11 years and older have been routinely recommended to receive a single dose of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of recommending a second dose of Tdap. METHODS: A static cohort model was used to calculate the epidemiologic and economic impact of adding a second dose of Tdap at age 16 or 21 years. Projected costs and outcomes were examined from a societal perspective over a 20-year period. Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALY) saved were calculated. RESULTS: Using baseline pertussis incidence from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, Tdap revaccination at either age 16 or 21 years would reduce outpatient visits by 433 (5%) and 285 (4%), and hospitalization cases by 7 (7%) and 5 (5%), respectively. The costs per QALY saved with a second dose of Tdap were approximately US $19.7 million (16 years) and $26.2 million (21 years). In sensitivity analyses, incidence most influenced the model; as incidence increased, the costs per QALY decreased. To a lesser degree, initial vaccine effectiveness and waning of effectiveness also affected cost outcomes. Multivariate sensitivity analyses showed that under a set of optimistic assumptions, the cost per QALY saved would be approximately $163,361 (16 years) and $204,556 (21 years). CONCLUSION: A second dose of Tdap resulted in a slight decrease in the number of cases and other outcomes, and that trend is more apparent when revaccinating at age 16 years than at age 21 years. Both revaccination strategies had high dollar per QALY saved even under optimistic assumptions in a multivariate sensitivity analysis.",2016-01-20035,26899377,Vaccine,Hajime Kamiya,2016,34 / 15,1832-8,Yes,26899377,"Hajime Kamiya; Bo-Hyun Cho; Mark L Messonnier; Thomas A Clark; Jennifer L Liang; Impact and cost-effectiveness of a second tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine dose to prevent pertussis in the United States, Vaccine, 2016 Apr 4; 34(15):1873-2518; 1832-8",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Adding a second dose of the Tetanus-diphtheria-acelluar pertussis (Tdap) vaccine at age 16 years vs. Standard/Usual Care- Receive one dose of Tdap at age 11 years, no revaccination",Not Stated,16 Years,16 Years,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,3.00,Not Stated,19728635,United States,2010,23415947.06
15388,Real-world cost effectiveness of MitraClip combined with Medical Therapy Versus Medical therapy alone in patients with moderate or severe mitral regurgitation,"BACKGROUND: We evaluated the real-world cost-effectiveness of the MitraClip system (Abbott Vascular Inc., Menlo Park, CA) plus medical therapy for patients with moderate/severe mitral regurgitation, as compared with medical therapy (MT) alone. METHODS: Clinical records of patients with moderate to severe functional mitral regurgitation treated with MitraClip (N=232) or with MT (N=151) were collected and outcome analyzed with propensity score adjustment to reduce selection bias. Twelve-month outcomes were modeled over a lifetime horizon to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis, in the payer's perspective. Costs and benefits were discounted at an annual rate of 3.5%. RESULTS: After propensity score adjustment, the average treatment effect was -9.5% probability of dying at 12months and, following lifetime modeling, 3.35+/-0.75 incremental life years and 3.01+/-0.57 incremental quality-adjusted life years. MitraClip contributed to a higher decrease in re-hospitalizations at 12months (difference=-0.54+/-0.08) and generated a more likely improvement in the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class at 12months versus NYHA at enrollment. Incremental costs, adapted to five possible scenarios, ranged from 14,493 to 29,795 euro contributing to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranging from 4796 to 7908 euro.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four cohorts of 25 patients with grade I L4-L5 degenerative spondylolisthesis were analyzed: cohort 1 (decompression), cohort 2 (decompression with instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF), cohort 3 (decompression with instrumented posterior lumbar interbody fusion/transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion), and cohort 4 (decompression with instrumented PLF and posterior lumbar interbody fusion/transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion). One-year postoperative health outcomes were assessed based on Visual Analogue Scale, Pain Disability Questionnaire, and EuroQol 5 Dimensions questionnaires. Direct medical costs were estimated using Medicare national payment amounts and indirect costs were based on patient missed work days. Postoperative 1-year cost/utility ratios and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using a threshold of $100,000/QALY gained. RESULTS: Compared with preoperative health states, EuroQol 5 Dimensions QALY scores improved for all cohorts (P<0.01). The 1-year cost-utility ratio for cohort 1 was significantly lower ($56,610/QALY gained; P<0.01) than that for cohorts 2 ($116,991/QALY gained), 3 ($109,740/QALY gained), and 4 ($107,546/QALY gained). The 1-year ICERs relative to cohort 1 were: cohort 2 (dominated), cohort 3 ($1,060,549/QALY gained), and cohort 4 ($830,047/QALY gained). CONCLUSIONS: Decompression without fusion is cost-effective for patients with grade I L4-L5 spondylolisthesis. Decompression with fusion is not cost effective in a 1-year timeframe for these patients based on the threshold. Accordingly, although fusion is beneficial for improving health outcomes in patients with spondylolisthesis, it is not cost-effective when analyzing a 1-year timeframe based on the threshold. The durability of these results must be analyzed with longer term cost-utility analysis studies.",2016-01-20051,26889996,Clin Spine Surg,Matthew D Alvin,2016,29 / 2,E80-6,No,26889996,"Matthew D Alvin; Daniel Lubelski; Kalil G Abdullah; Robert G Whitmore; Edward C Benzel; Thomas E Mroz; Cost-Utility Analysis of Instrumented Fusion Versus Decompression Alone for Grade I L4-L5 Spondylolisthesis at 1-Year Follow-up: A Pilot Study, Clin Spine Surg, 2016 Mar; 29(2):2380-0194; E80-6",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cohort 2: Treating patients using decompression with instrumented posterolateral fusion (PLF) vs. Cohort 1: Treating patients using decompression,Have either mechanical lower back pain or leg pain that was refractory to nonsurgical treatment.,70 Years,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United States,2012,Not Stated

15397,Cost-Utility Analysis of Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion With Plating (ACDFP) Versus Posterior Cervical Foraminotomy (PCF) for Patients With Single-level Cervical Radiculopathy at 1-Year Follow-up,"STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective 1-year cost-utility analysis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost-effectiveness of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion with plating (ACDFP) in comparison with posterior cervical foraminotomy (PCF) for patients with single-level cervical radiculopathy. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Cervical radiculopathy due to cervical spondylosis is commonly treated by either PCF or ACDFP for patients who are refractory to nonsurgical treatment. Although some have suggested superior outcomes with ACDFP as compared with PCF, the former is also associated with greater costs. The present study analyzes the cost-effectiveness of ACDFP versus PCF for patients with single-level cervical radiculopathy. METHODS: Forty-five patients who underwent ACDFP and 25 patients who underwent PCF for single-level cervical radiculopathy were analyzed. One-year postoperative health outcomes were assessed based on Visual Analogue Scale, Pain Disability Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire, and EuroQOL-5 Dimensions questionnaires to analyze the comparative effectiveness of each procedure. Direct medical costs were estimated using Medicare national payment amounts and indirect costs were based on patient missed work days and patient income. Postoperative 1-year cost/utility ratios and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) were calculated to assess for cost-effectiveness using a threshold of $100,000/QALY gained. RESULTS: The 1-year cost-utility ratio for the PCF cohort was significantly lower ($79,856/QALY gained) than that for the ACDFP cohort ($131,951/QALY gained) (P<0.01). In calculating the 1-year ICER, as the ACDFP cohort showed lower QALY gained than the PCF cohort, the ICER was negative and is not reported, meaning that ACDFP was dominated by PCF. CONCLUSIONS: Statistically significant and clinically relevant improvements (through minimum clinically important differences) were seen in both cohorts. Although both cohorts showed improved health outcomes, ACDFP was not cost-effective relative to the threshold of $100,000/QALY gained at 1-year postoperatively, whereas PCF was.

15398,The impact and cost-effectiveness of nonavalent HPV vaccination in the United States: Estimates from a simplified transmission model,"INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to assess the incremental costs and benefits of the 9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) compared with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV). Like 4vHPV, 9vHPV protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. 9vHPV also protects against 5 additional HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. METHODS: We adapted a previously published model of the impact and cost-effectiveness of 4vHPV to include the 5 additional HPV types in 9vHPV. The vaccine strategies we examined were (1) 4vHPV for males and females; (2) 9vHPV for females and 4vHPV for males; and (3) 9vHPV for males and females. In the base case, 9vHPV cost $13 more per dose than 4vHPV, based on available vaccine price information. RESULTS: Providing 9vHPV to females compared with 4vHPV for females (assuming 4vHPV for males in both scenarios) was cost-saving regardless of whether or not cross-protection for 4vHPV was assumed. The cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by 9vHPV for both sexes (compared with 4vHPV for both sexes) was < $0 (cost-saving) when assuming no cross-protection for 4vHPV and $8,600 when assuming cross-protection for 4vHPV.
