15801,Direct-acting antivirals combination for elderly patients with chronic hepatitis C: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) has been undertreated among elderly patients. Interferon-free treatment represents an opportunity for these patients. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of directly acting antivirals (DAAs) in CHC elderly patients. METHODS: A Markov model of CHC natural history was built. This study focuses on CHC patients older than 65 years, stratified according to genotype (1/4, 2 and 3), liver fibrosis (METAVIR F1 to F4), age and frailty phenotype (robust, pre-frail and frail). DAAs combination vs no treatment was simulated for each theoretical population, assessing life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in a lifetime time horizon and by the Healthcare System perspective. RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increased with age and frailty status in all fibrosis stages. For robust F3 and F4 patients ICERs remained below the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) of 40 000euro/QALY up to age 75 and 86 years, respectively, depending on drug price and sustained virological response probability (sensitivity analysis). Notably, in F4 and frail subjects older than 75 years, ICER was more sensitive to non-liver-related mortality rate. In elderly F1 and F2 patients, ICERs were below WTP only up to 77 years old, with wide variability among frailty phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of DAAs treatment of elderly CHC patients is solid in those with advanced fibrosis, but it depends strongly on frailty status and age, particularly in patients with milder fibrosis stages. Accurate assessment of clinical variables, including frailty, is necessary to allocate limited resources to this special population.",2016-01-21491,27943549,Liver Int,Antonio Ciaccio,2016,/,,No,27943549,"Antonio Ciaccio; Paolo Angelo Cortesi; Giuseppe Bellelli; Matteo Rota; Sara Conti; Stefano Okolicsanyi; Monica Rota; Giancarlo Cesana; Lorenzo Mantovani Giovanni; Giorgio Annoni; Mario Strazzabosco; Direct-acting antivirals combination for elderly patients with chronic hepatitis C: A cost-effectiveness analysis, Liver Int, 2016 Dec 10; ():1478-3223",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sofosbuvir and ledipasvir vs. None,Genotype 1 and 4 with F4 fibrosis and Frailty phenotype pre-frail,75 Years,75 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3,3,16796,Euro,2015,20352.89

This study focuses on CHC patients older than 65 years, stratified according to genotype (1/4, 2 and 3), liver fibrosis (METAVIR F1 to F4), age and frailty phenotype (robust, pre-frail and frail). DAAs combination vs no treatment was simulated for each theoretical population, assessing life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in a lifetime time horizon and by the Healthcare System perspective. RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increased with age and frailty status in all fibrosis stages. For robust F3 and F4 patients ICERs remained below the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) of 40 000euro/QALY up to age 75 and 86 years, respectively, depending on drug price and sustained virological response probability (sensitivity analysis). Notably, in F4 and frail subjects older than 75 years, ICER was more sensitive to non-liver-related mortality rate. In elderly F1 and F2 patients, ICERs were below WTP only up to 77 years old, with wide variability among frailty phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness of DAAs treatment of elderly CHC patients is solid in those with advanced fibrosis, but it depends strongly on frailty status and age, particularly in patients with milder fibrosis stages.

For robust F3 and F4 patients ICERs remained below the willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) of 40 000euro/QALY up to age 75 and 86 years, respectively, depending on drug price and sustained virological response probability (sensitivity analysis). Notably, in F4 and frail subjects older than 75 years, ICER was more sensitive to non-liver-related mortality rate. In elderly F1 and F2 patients, ICERs were below WTP only up to 77 years old, with wide variability among frailty phenotypes.

15866,Cost Utility Analysis of Topical Steroids Compared With Dietary Elimination for Treatment of Eosinophilic Esophagitis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Topical corticosteroids or dietary elimination are recommended as first-line therapies for eosinophilic esophagitis, but data to directly compare these therapies are scant. We performed a cost utility comparison of topical corticosteroids and the 6-food elimination diet (SFED) in treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis, from the payer perspective. METHODS: We used a modified Markov model based on current clinical guidelines, in which transition between states depended on histologic response simulated at the individual cohort-member level. Simulation parameters were defined by systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the base-case estimates and bounds of uncertainty for sensitivity analysis. Meta-regression models included adjustment for differences in study and cohort characteristics. RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, topical fluticasone was about as effective as SFED but more expensive at a 5-year time horizon ($9261.58 vs $5719.72 per person). SFED was more effective and less expensive than topical fluticasone and topical budesonide in the base-case scenario.

15869,Cost-Effectiveness of Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair Versus Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty for the Treatment of Massive Rotator Cuff Tears in Patients With Pseudoparalysis and Nonarthritic Shoulders,"PURPOSE: To determine the most cost-effective treatment strategy for patients with massive rotator cuff tears and pseudoparalysis of the shoulder without osteoarthritis of the glenohumeral joint (PP without OA). Specifically, we aimed to compare arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) versus reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) and investigate the effect of patient age on this decision. METHODS: A Markov decision model was used to compare 3 treatment strategies for addressing PP without OA: (1) ARCR with option to arthroscopically revise once, (2) ARCR with immediate conversion to RTSA on potential failure, and (3) primary RTSA. Hypothetical patients were cycled through the model according to transition probabilities, meanwhile accruing financial costs, utility for time in health states, and disutilities for surgical procedures. Utilities were derived from the Short Form-6D scale and expressed as quality-adjusted life-years. Model parameters were derived from the literature and from expert opinion, and thorough sensitivity analyses were conducted. TreeAge Pro 2015 software was used to construct and assess the Markov model. RESULTS: For the base-case scenario (60-year-old patient), ARCR with conversion to RTSA on potential failure was the most cost-effective strategy when we assumed equal utility for the ARCR and RTSA health states. Primary RTSA became cost-effective when the utility of RTSA exceeded that of ARCR by 0.04 quality-adjusted life-years per year. Age at decision did not substantially change this result. CONCLUSIONS: Primary ARCR with conversion to RTSA on potential failure was found to be the most cost-effective strategy for PP without OA. This result was independent of age.

15871,Societal implications of medical insurance coverage for imatinib as first-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in China: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVES: Imatinib (Glivec) and nilotinib (Tasigna) have been covered by critical disease insurance in Jiangsu province of China since 2013, which changed local treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). This study evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of insurance coverage with imatinib as the first-line treatment for patients with CML in China from a societal perspective. METHODS: A decision-analytic model based on previously published and real-world evidence was applied to simulate and evaluate the lifetime clinical and economic outcomes associated with CML treatments before and after imatinib was covered by medical insurance. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated with both costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) discounted at 3% annually. Different assumptions of treatment benefits and costs were taken to address uncertainties and were tested with sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In base case analysis, both cost and effectiveness of CML treatments increased after imatinib was covered by the medical insurance; on average, the incremental QALY and cost were 5.5 and yen277,030 per patient in lifetime, respectively. The ICER of insurance coverage with imatinib was yen50,641, which is less than the GDP per capita of China. Monte Carlo simulation resulted in the estimate of 100% probability that the insurance coverage of imatinib is cost-effective. Total cost was substantially saved at 5 years after patients initiated imatinib treatment with insurance coverage compared to no insurance coverage, the saved cost at 5 years was yen99,565, which included the cost savings from both direct (e.g. cost of bone marrow or stem cell transplant) and indirect costs (e.g. productivity loss of patients and care-givers). CONCLUSIONS: The insurance coverage of imatinib is very cost-effective in China, according to the local cost and clinical data in Jiangsu province. More importantly, the insurance coverage of imatinib and nilotinib have changed the treatment patterns of CML patients, thus dramatically increasing life expectancy and quality-of-life (QoL) saving on productivity losses for both CML patients and their caregivers.",2016-01-21500,27936995,J Med Econ,Guangying Sheng,2017,20 / 4,1-25,Yes,27936995,"Guangying Sheng; Suning Chen; Chaohui Dong; Ri Zhang; Miao Miao; Wu Depei; Seng Chuen Tan; Chao Liu; Tengbin Xiong; Societal implications of medical insurance coverage for imatinib as first-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in China: a cost-effectiveness analysis, J Med Econ, 2017 Apr; 20(4):1369-6998; 1-25",QALY,China,Not Stated,Not Stated,Insurance coverage for imatinib: Yes vs. Insurance coverage for imatinib: No,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3,3,50641,China,2014,8985.46
15872,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Prophylaxis Treatment Strategies to Reduce the Incidence of Febrile Neutropenia in Patients with Early-Stage Breast Cancer or Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of no prophylaxis, primary prophylaxis (PP), or secondary prophylaxis (SP) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs), i.e., pegfilgrastim, lipegfilgrastim, filgrastim (6- and 11-day), or lenograstim (6- and 11-day), to reduce the incidence of febrile neutropenia (FN) in patients with stage II breast cancer receiving TC (docetaxel, cyclophosphamide) and in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) receiving R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) over a lifetime horizon from a Belgian payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov cycle tree tracked FN events during chemotherapy (3-week cycles) and long-term survival (1-year cycles). Model inputs, including the efficacy of each strategy, risk of reduced relative dose intensity (RDI), and the impact of RDI on mortality, utilities, and costs (in euro; 2014 values) were estimated from public sources and the published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were assessed for each strategy for costs per FN event avoided, life-year (LY) saved, and quality-adjusted LY (QALY) saved. LYs and QALYs saved were discounted at 1.5% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (DSAs and PSAs) were conducted. RESULTS: Base-case ICERs for PP with pegfilgrastim relative to SP with pegfilgrastim were euro15,500 per QALY and euro14,800 per LY saved for stage II breast cancer and euro7800 per QALY and euro6900 per LY saved for NHL; other comparators were either more expensive and less effective than PP or SP with pegfilgrastim or had lower costs but higher ICERs (relative to SP with pegfilgrastim) than PP with pegfilgrastim. Results of the DSA for breast cancer and NHL comparing PP and SP with pegfilgrastim indicate that the model results were most sensitive to the cycle 1 risk of FN, the proportion of FN events requiring hospitalization, the relative risk of FN in cycles >/=2 versus cycle 1, no history of FN, and the mortality hazard ratio for RDI (<90% vs >/=90% [for NHL]).

METHODS: A Markov cycle tree tracked FN events during chemotherapy (3-week cycles) and long-term survival (1-year cycles). Model inputs, including the efficacy of each strategy, risk of reduced relative dose intensity (RDI), and the impact of RDI on mortality, utilities, and costs (in euro; 2014 values) were estimated from public sources and the published literature.

15896,Cost-Effectiveness Comparison Between the Response-Guided Therapies and Monotherapies of Nucleos(t)ide Analogues for Chronic Hepatitis B Patients in China,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) monotherapies are typically used as the primary treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, including lamivudine (LAM), telbivudine (TBV), adefovir (ADV), entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF). For high-resistance NAs (LAM, TBV, ADV), they can generate excellent clinical outcomes by using response-guided therapy; however, their pharmacoeconomic profiles remain unclear in China. We aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness between response-guided therapies and monotherapies of NAs for Chinese hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive and -negative CHB patients. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate CHB progression associated with 12 treatment strategies using effectiveness and cost data from the published literature. We measured the lifetime costs, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way sensitivity (especially to extend the range of the TDF price) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore the uncertainties of the model. RESULTS: For both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients, no treatment strategy generated the lowest lifetime costs (US$31,185-US$31,338) and QALYs (7.54-7.58). ETV and TDF monotherapies were not dominated by other treatments, whereas, the ICER of ETV monotherapy was the lowest (US$6112/QALY-US$8533/QALY). For each high-resistance NA, compared with its monotherapy, the ICERs of its response-guided therapies were below the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$22,833/QALY. Additionally, TDF monotherapy was the preferred treatment when its price dropped to US$1820/year or lower. CONCLUSION: Among 12 treatment strategies evaluated, ETV monotherapy is the most cost-effective treatment for treatment-naive CHB patients in China.

For high-resistance NAs (LAM, TBV, ADV), they can generate excellent clinical outcomes by using response-guided therapy; however, their pharmacoeconomic profiles remain unclear in China. We aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness between response-guided therapies and monotherapies of NAs for Chinese hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive and -negative CHB patients. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to simulate CHB progression associated with 12 treatment strategies using effectiveness and cost data from the published literature. We measured the lifetime costs, quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). One-way sensitivity (especially to extend the range of the TDF price) and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore the uncertainties of the model. RESULTS: For both HBeAg-positive and -negative patients, no treatment strategy generated the lowest lifetime costs (US$31,185-US$31,338) and QALYs (7.54-7.58). ETV and TDF monotherapies were not dominated by other treatments, whereas, the ICER of ETV monotherapy was the lowest (US$6112/QALY-US$8533/QALY). For each high-resistance NA, compared with its monotherapy, the ICERs of its response-guided therapies were below the willingness-to-pay threshold of US$22,833/QALY. Additionally, TDF monotherapy was the preferred treatment when its price dropped to US$1820/year or lower. CONCLUSION: Among 12 treatment strategies evaluated, ETV monotherapy is the most cost-effective treatment for treatment-naive CHB patients in China.
