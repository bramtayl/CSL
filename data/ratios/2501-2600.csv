2501,Cost-effectiveness of screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis due to chronic hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND: Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhotic patients using abdominal ultrasonography and alpha-foetoprotein levels is widely practiced. AIM: To evaluate its cost-effectiveness using a Markov decision model. METHODS: Several screening strategies with abdominal ultrasonography or computerized tomography and serum alpha-foetoprotein at 6-12-month intervals in 40-year-old patients with chronic hepatitis C and compensated cirrhosis were simulated from a societal perspective, resulting in discounted costs per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: For the least efficacious strategy, annual alpha-foetoprotein/ultrasonography, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (vs. no screening) was $23 043/quality-adjusted life-year. Biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography, the most commonly used strategy in the United States, was more efficacious, with a cost-effectiveness ratio of $33 083/quality-adjusted life-year vs. annual alpha-foetoprotein/ultrasonography. The most efficacious strategy, biannual alpha-foetoprotein/ultrasonography, resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $73 789/quality-adjusted life-year vs. biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography. Biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual computerized tomography screening resulted in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $51 750/quality-adjusted life-year vs. biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography screening. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is as cost-effective as other accepted screening protocols. Of the strategies evaluated, biannual alpha-foetoprotein/annual ultrasonography gives the most quality-adjusted life-year gain while still maintaining a cost-effectiveness ratio <$50 000/quality-adjusted life-year.

2504,A health economic model to assess the long term effects and cost-effectiveness of PEG IFN alpha-2a in hepatitis C virus infected patients,"OBJECTIVES: Chronic Hepatitis C (CHC) is associated with long-term complications. Treating CHC with Pegylated interferon alpha-2a (PEG IFN alpha-2a) improves response rates and may contribute to less morbidity and mortality compared to standard interferon therapy. The objectives of this study were to estimate the long-term clinical consequences of such treatment as well as the resulting cost-effectiveness. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed in order to predict the clinical and economic outcomes over a 25 year period. Three analyses were conducted: 1. for all Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) genotypes where PEG IFN alpha-2a was compared to interferon alpha-2a (IFN alpha-2a) in monotherapy for 48 weeks; 2. for the HCV genotypes 1-4-5-6 comparing PEG IFN alpha-2a with interferon alpha-2b (IFN alpha-2b) both combined with ribavirin 1000/1200 mg for 48 weeks; and 3, where PEG IFN alpha-2a with 800 mg ribavirin was compared to IFN alpha-2b with ribavirin 1000/1200 mg for 24 weeks in genotypes 2 and 3. RESULTS: In analysis one the cost-effectiveness of PEG IFN alpha-2a is 4,569/quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. In the second analysis, the result was 14,763 euros/QALY, while for the 24 weeks therapy (analysis 3) the result was 903 per QALY gained. In an extensive sensitivity analysis cost-effectiveness was confirmed within reasonable assumptions.

2507,A decision-analytic economic evaluation of valaciclovir prophylaxis for the prevention of cytomegalovirus infection and disease in renal transplantation,"OBJECTIVE: This analysis evaluates the cost-effectiveness of valaciclovir prophylaxis using clinically and economically important health outcomes including graft failure, life-years, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). METHODS: A Markov model was developed using a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of valaciclovir prophylaxis, together with a published epidemiological study and national renal transplant registry data. The model""s population was stratified into two risk groups by donor/recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus at transplantation: donor-positive/recipient-negative (D+R-) and recipient-positive (R+) patients. The model estimated costs and health outcomes over a 30-yr period from the perspective of Australian health care providers. RESULTS: The total health care cost was $3619 lower for D+R- patients receiving valaciclovir prophylaxis compared with those not receiving prophylaxis. D+R- patients receiving valaciclovir gained an extra 0.33 yr of life and 0.27 QALYs. R+ patients receiving valaciclovir prophylaxis gained an extra 0.07 yr of life and 0.05 QALYs, with an incremental cost of $914. This equates to $17 127 per QALY gained, which is highly cost-effective compared with other drugs and health interventions.

2509,Training care givers of stroke patients: economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Training care givers reduces their burden and improves psychosocial outcomes in care givers and patients at one year. However, the cost effectiveness of this approach has not been investigated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of caregiver training by examining health and social care costs, informal care costs, and quality adjusted life years in care givers. DESIGN: A single, blind, randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Stroke rehabilitation unit. SUBJECTS: 300 stroke patients and their care givers. INTERVENTIONS: Caregiver training in basic nursing and facilitation of personal care techniques compared with no care giver training. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health and social care costs, informal care costs, and quality adjusted life years in care givers over one year after stroke. RESULTS: Total health and social care costs over one year for patients whose care givers received training were significantly lower (mean difference -4043 pounds sterling (7249 dollars; 6072 euros), 95% confidence interval -6544 pounds sterling to -595 pounds sterling). Inclusion of informal care costs, which were similar between the two groups, did not alter this conclusion. The cost difference was largely due to differences in length of hospital stay. The EQ-5D did not detect changes in quality adjusted life years in care givers. CONCLUSION: Compared with no training, caregiver training during rehabilitation of patients reduced costs of care while improving overall quality of life in care givers at one year.",2004-01-00315,15130978,BMJ,Anita Patel,2004,328 / 7448,1102,No,15130978,"Anita Patel; Martin Knapp; Andrew Evans; Inigo Perez; Lalit Kalra; Martin Knapp; Andrew Evans; Inigo Perez; Lalit Kalra; Training care givers of stroke patients: economic evaluation, BMJ, 2004-May-08; 328(7448):0959-8138; 1102",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Caregivers training vs. No caregivers training,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2001,Not Stated
2510,Pharmacoeconomic evaluation of testing for angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype before starting beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor therapy in men,"This study aimed to assess the potential cost-effectiveness of screening men for their angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-genotype before starting statin therapy. We used a combination of decision-analytic and Markov modelling techniques to evaluate the long-term incremental clinical and economic effects associated with genetic testing of men with hypercholesterolemia before starting treatment with statins. The study was performed from a health care payer perspective. We used data from the Rotterdam study, a prospective population-based cohort study in the Netherlands, which was started in 1990 and included 7983 subjects aged 55 years and older. Men treated with cholesterol-lowering drugs at baseline or with a baseline total cholesterol > or = 6.5 mmol/l were included. The ratio of difference in lifelong costs between the screening strategy and the no screening strategy to difference in life expectancy between these strategies was calculated. We also performed a cost-utility analysis. The base case was a 55-year-old man with hypercholesterolemia who was initially untreated. Several univariate sensitivity analyses were performed. All costs were discounted with an annual rate of 5%. Screening men for their ACE-genotype was the dominant strategy for the base case analysis, because the screening strategy saved money (851 Euro), but life expectancy was not changed. Screening was the dominant strategy for all age-groups in our cohort. Even in 80-year-old subjects, with the shortest life-expectancy, it was cheaper to screen than to give lifelong treatment to men with a DD genotype without success. Even if all DD subjects were treated with other (non-statin) cholesterol-lowering drugs, screening remained the cost-effective strategy. The results of the cost-utility analysis were similar. Discounting the effects with 5% per year also had no major impact on the conclusions. If other studies confirm that men with the DD genotype do not benefit from treatment with statins, screening for ACE genotype in men most likely will be a cost-effective strategy before initiating statin therapy.",2004-01-00320,15128051,Pharmacogenetics,Anke Hilse Maitland-van der Zee,2004,14 / 1,53-60,No,15128051,"Anke Hilse Maitland-van der Zee; Olaf H Klungel; Bruno H Ch Stricker; David L Veenstra; John J P Kastelein; Albert Hofman; Jacqueline C M Witteman; Hubertus G M Leufkens; Cornelia M van Duijn; Anthonius de Boer; Olaf H Klungel; Bruno H Ch Stricker; David L Veenstra; John J P Kastelein; Albert Hofman; Jacqueline C M Witteman; Hubertus G M Leufkens; Cornelia M van Duijn; Anthonius de Boer; Pharmacoeconomic evaluation of testing for angiotensin-converting enzyme genotype before starting beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor therapy in men, Pharmacogenetics, 2004-Jan; 14(1):0960-314X; 53-60",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) - genotype vs. No screening,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,-850.81,Euro,2002,-1157.16

In the absence of direct evidence, cost-effectiveness models may provide guidance about preferred screening strategies. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of 2 diabetes screening strategies: screening targeted to people with hypertension and universal screening. DESIGN: Markov model. DATA SOURCES: United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, Hypertension Optimal Treatment trial, and recent cost data. TARGET POPULATION: General primary care population in the United States. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Health care system. INTERVENTIONS: Diabetes screening targeted to people with hypertension and universal screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Costs (in 1997 U.S. dollars) and QALYs discounted at a 3% annual rate. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: At all ages, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were more favorable for screening targeted to people with hypertension than for universal screening. For example, at age 55 years, the cost per QALY for targeted screening compared with no screening was 34,375 dollars, whereas the cost per QALY for universal screening compared with targeted screening was 360,966 dollars. Screening was more cost-effective for ages 55 to 75 years than for younger ages. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: In single-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, findings were robust to therapy costs, screening costs, screening lead time, reduced effectiveness of intensive antihypertensive therapy, and increased relative risk reduction for stroke attributable to intensive hypertension control. LIMITATIONS: We did not consider screening targeted to persons with dyslipidemia, and we used studies of people whose diabetes was detected clinically to estimate screening benefits.

2521,Economic evaluation of folate supplementation during methotrexate treatment in rheumatoid arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: To determine cost-effectiveness of folic or folinic acid supplementation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who started methotrexate (MTX) treatment. METHODS: An economic evaluation, performed alongside a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial with followup of 48 weeks. Patients started MTX with placebo (n = 137), folic acid (n = 133), or folinic acid (n = 141). Outcome measures were drug survival and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), measured with the EuroQol questionnaire. Both medical and nonmedical costs were analyzed. RESULTS: Drug survival after 48 weeks was 60% for placebo, 81% for folic acid, and 87% for folinic acid. QALY during a 48 week period were 0.55 (95% CI 0.52-0.58) in the placebo group, 0.55 (95% CI 0.52-0.58) in the folic acid group, and 0.58 (95% CI 0.56-0.60) in the folinic acid group.

2523,A cost-effectiveness analysis of bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for febrile children who have cardiac lesions and undergo urinary catheterization in the emergency department,"OBJECTIVE: To prevent bacterial endocarditis (BE) in those at risk, the American Heart Association recommends antibiotics for patients who have a known urinary tract infection and are about to undergo urinary catheterization (UC). In young children who have cardiac lesions and undergo UC for fever without a source, the problem with prophylaxis only in the presence of infected urine is that the presence of urinary tract infection is unknown before testing. This study was conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of BE prophylaxis before UC in febrile children aged 0-24 months with moderate-risk cardiac lesions. METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BE prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis from the societal perspective. Clinical outcomes were based on BE incidence and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilities were derived from the medical literature. Costs were derived from national and local sources in US dollars for the reference year 2000, using a discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: On the basis of the analysis, prophylaxis prevents 7 BE cases per 1 million children treated. When antibiotic-associated deaths were included, the no-prophylaxis strategy was more effective and less costly than the prophylaxis strategy. When antibiotic-associated deaths were excluded, amoxicillin cost 10 million dollars per QALY gained and 70 million dollars per case prevented. For vancomycin, it was 13 million dollars per QALY gained and 95 million dollars per case prevented. The results were robust to variations in the prophylactic efficacy of antibiotics, incidence of bacteremia after UC, incidence of BE after bacteremia, and costs associated with BE prophylaxis and treatment. CONCLUSION: In the emergency department, BE prophylaxis before UC in febrile children who are aged 0 to 24 months and have moderate-risk cardiac lesions is not a cost-effective use of health care resources.",2004-01-00331,15121944,Pediatrics,A Chantal Caviness,2004,113 / 5,1291-6,No,15121944,"A Chantal Caviness; Scott B Cantor; Coburn H Allen; Mark A Ward; Scott B Cantor; Coburn H Allen; Mark A Ward; A cost-effectiveness analysis of bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for febrile children who have cardiac lesions and undergo urinary catheterization in the emergency department, Pediatrics, 2004-May; 113(5):1098-4275; 1291-6",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Amoxicillin vs. No antibiotic prophylaxis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,-9876600,United States,2000,-14844208.61

2525,A cost-effectiveness analysis of bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis for febrile children who have cardiac lesions and undergo urinary catheterization in the emergency department,"OBJECTIVE: To prevent bacterial endocarditis (BE) in those at risk, the American Heart Association recommends antibiotics for patients who have a known urinary tract infection and are about to undergo urinary catheterization (UC). In young children who have cardiac lesions and undergo UC for fever without a source, the problem with prophylaxis only in the presence of infected urine is that the presence of urinary tract infection is unknown before testing. This study was conducted to determine the cost-effectiveness of BE prophylaxis before UC in febrile children aged 0-24 months with moderate-risk cardiac lesions. METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of BE prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis from the societal perspective. Clinical outcomes were based on BE incidence and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilities were derived from the medical literature. Costs were derived from national and local sources in US dollars for the reference year 2000, using a discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: On the basis of the analysis, prophylaxis prevents 7 BE cases per 1 million children treated. When antibiotic-associated deaths were included, the no-prophylaxis strategy was more effective and less costly than the prophylaxis strategy. When antibiotic-associated deaths were excluded, amoxicillin cost 10 million dollars per QALY gained and 70 million dollars per case prevented. For vancomycin, it was 13 million dollars per QALY gained and 95 million dollars per case prevented. The results were robust to variations in the prophylactic efficacy of antibiotics, incidence of bacteremia after UC, incidence of BE after bacteremia, and costs associated with BE prophylaxis and treatment.

2526,Regionalization of treatment for subarachnoid hemorrhage: a cost-utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that for the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), outcomes are improved but costs are higher at hospitals with a high volume of admissions for SAH. Whether regionalization of care for SAH is cost-effective is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a cost-utility analysis, health outcomes for patients with SAH were modeled for 2 scenarios: 1 representing the current practice in California in which most patients with SAH are treated at the closest hospital and 1 representing the regionalization of care in which patients at hospitals with <20 SAH admissions annually (low volume) would be transferred to hospitals with > or =20 SAH admissions annually (high volume). Using a Markov model, we compared net quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost per QALY. Inputs were chosen from the literature and derived from a cohort study in California. Transferring a patient with SAH from a low- to a high-volume hospital would result in a gain of 1.60 QALYs at a cost of 10,548 dollars/QALY. For transfer to result in only borderline cost-effectiveness (50,000 dollars/QALY), differences in case fatality rates between low- and high-volume hospitals would have to be one fifth as large (2.2%) or risk of death during transfer would have to be 5 times greater (9.8%) than estimated in the base case. CONCLUSIONS: Transfer of patients with SAH from low- to high-volume hospitals appears to be cost-effective, and regionalization of care may be justified.

2527,Comparison of the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap and free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap in postmastectomy reconstruction: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"This study compared the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap and the free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (TRAM) flap in postmastectomy reconstruction using a cost-effectiveness analysis. A decision analytic model was used. Medical costs associated with the two techniques were estimated from the Ontario Ministry of Health Schedule of Benefits for 2002. Hospital costs were obtained from St. Joseph""s Healthcare, a university teaching hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The utilities of clinically important health states related to breast reconstruction were obtained from 32 ""experts"" across Canada and converted into quality-adjusted life years. The probabilities of these various clinically important health states being associated with the DIEP and free TRAM flaps were obtained after a thorough review of the literature. The DIEP flap was more costly than the free TRAM flap ($7026.47 versus $6508.29), but it provided more quality-adjusted life years than the free TRAM flap (28.88 years versus 28.53 years). The baseline incremental cost-utility ratio was $1464.30 per quality-adjusted life year, favoring adoption of the DIEP flap. Sensitivity analyses were performed by assuming that the probabilities of occurrence of hernia, abdominal bulging, total flap loss, operating room time, and hospital stay were identical with the DIEP and free TRAM techniques. By assuming that the probability of postoperative hernia for the DIEP flap increased from 0.008 to 0.054 (same as for TRAM flap), the incremental cost-utility ratio changed to $1435.00 per quality-adjusted life year. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the complication of hernia because the DIEP flap allegedly diminishes this complication. Increasing the probability of abdominal bulge from 0.041 to 0.103 for the DIEP flap changed the ratio to $2731.78 per quality-adjusted life year. When the probability of total flap failure was increased from 0.014 to 0.016, the ratio changed to $1384.01 per quality-adjusted life year. When the time in the operating room was assumed to be the same for both flaps, the ratio changed to $4026.57 per quality-adjusted life year. If the hospital stay was assumed to be the same for both flaps, the ratio changed to $1944.30 per quality-adjusted life year. On the basis of the baseline calculation and sensitivity analyses, the DIEP flap remained a cost-effective procedure. Thus, adoption of this new technique for postmastectomy reconstruction is warranted in the Canadian health care system.",2004-01-00338,15114125,Plast Reconstr Surg,Achilleas Thoma,2004,113 / 6,1650-61,No,15114125,"Achilleas Thoma; Karen Veltri; Dana Khuthaila; Gloria Rockwell; Eric Duku; Karen Veltri; Dana Khuthaila; Gloria Rockwell; Eric Duku; Comparison of the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap and free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap in postmastectomy reconstruction: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Plast Reconstr Surg, 2004-May; 113(6):0032-1052; 1650-61",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Deep inferior epigastric perforator flap vs. Free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,1464.3,Canada,2002,1341.73
2528,Cost-effectiveness analysis of telemedicine to evaluate diabetic retinopathy in a prison population,"OBJECTIVE: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted to investigate the clinical and economic impact of teleophthalmology in evaluating diabetic retinopathy in prison inmates with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on a hypothetical teleophthalmology system to evaluate diabetic retinopathy patients with type 2 diabetes in a prison care setting, a Markov decision model was developed with probability and cost data derived primarily from published epidemiological and outcome studies. A 40-year-old African-American man with type 2 diabetes was used as a reference case subject. The number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained was used as the clinical outcome, and the cost in U.S. dollars from the year 2003 was used as the economic outcome. Teleophthalmology and nonteleophthalmology strategies were compared using an expected QALYs calculation and two types of sensitivity analyses: probabilistic and traditional n-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The teleophthalmology strategy dominates in the cost-effectiveness analysis for the reference case subject: 16,514/18.73 dollars QALYs for teleophthalmology and 17,590/18.58 dollars QALYs for nonteleophthalmology. Ninety percent of the Monte Carlo simulations showed cost effectiveness (annual cost/QALYs < or = 50,000 dollars) in the teleophthalmology strategy based on an assumed inmate population. Teleophthalmology is the better strategy if the number of diabetic inmates in the prison community is >500. CONCLUSIONS: Our cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates that teleophthalmology holds great promise to reduce the cost of inmate care and reduce blindness caused by diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetic patients.",2004-01-00339,15111527,Diabetes Care,Noriaki Aoki,2004,27 / 5,1095-101,No,15111527,"Noriaki Aoki; Kim Dunn; Tsuguya Fukui; J Robert Beck; William J Schull; Helen K Li; Kim Dunn; Tsuguya Fukui; J Robert Beck; William J Schull; Helen K Li; Cost-effectiveness analysis of telemedicine to evaluate diabetic retinopathy in a prison population, Diabetes Care, 2004-May; 27(5):0149-5992; 1095-101",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Teleophthalmology vs. No teleophthalmology,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-7173.33,United States,2003,-10089.88

This economic evaluation was based on detailed data from patient charts and hospital information systems. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean total treatment and follow-up costs of the myeloablative treatment arm were 81,643 euros compared to 68,802 euros for the chemotherapy arm (P=0.09). Costs per quality-adjusted life year were 51,357 euros versus 37,328 euros. In the clinical study, no significant differences were found in overall survival after a median follow-up of 33 months from randomisation.

2530,Hepatitis B immunization: cost calculation in a community-based study in India,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: In India, approximately 65% of mothers deliver at home, and a community-based study evaluating the cost of vaccinating newborns with the first dose of hepatitis B vaccine within 48 hours has not been undertaken previously. This policy planning study was done to evaluate the costs of such immunization in India. METHODS: All mothers delivering in the study area (population 65,000) over a 1-year period were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg; ELISA), and babies of positive mothers were vaccinated starting at birth. The cost of such selective vaccination was calculated. The cost of nursing time required for universal immunization was calculated from the data on nursing time required for vaccination in the selective vaccination program. The national cost of universal immunization without testing was calculated as well as cost-benefit and cost-utility in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. Sensitivity testing considering economies of scale was also factored in. RESULTS: 1100 mothers delivered during the study period. 252 were primiparous. Nationwide universal vaccination would cost Rs 48,000 per QALY saved, which was double the per capita GNP of the country; discounted at 3% the cost was Rs 260,000.

2531,Cost-effectiveness of thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke assessed by a model based on UK NHS costs,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Thrombolytic therapy is licensed for use in highly selected patients with acute ischemic stroke. We aimed to model the health economic impact of limited use of thrombolytic therapy and to assess whether it was likely to be cost-effective when used more widely in the UK National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: The authors formed a discussion panel to develop the decision-analysis model of acute stroke care. It consisted of Markov state-transition processes, with probabilities of different health states determined by certain key variables. The range of estimates of efficacy of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was taken from an update to a Cochrane systematic review of randomized trials of thrombolysis. Data on outcome after stroke were taken from our hospital-based stroke register, supplemented by data derived from relevant literature sources. RESULTS: The model suggested that compared with standard care, if eligible patients were treated with rt-PA up to 6 hours, there was a 78% probability of a gain in quality-adjusted survival during the first year, at a cost of pound 13 581 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Over a lifetime, rt-PA was associated with cost-savings of pound 96 565 per QALY. However, the estimates were imprecise and highly susceptible to the assumptions used in the economic model; under several plausible assumptions, rt-PA was much less cost-effective than standard care, and under others, a great deal more cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: The estimates of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness were imprecise. Although the benefits appeared promising, the data did not support the widespread use of thrombolytic therapy outside the terms of the current restricted license in routine clinical practice in the NHS.

2533,Projected clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of a human papillomavirus 16/18 vaccine,"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine may be commercially available in a few years. We explored the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of introducing an HPV16/18 vaccine in a population with an organized cervical cancer screening program. METHODS: A computer-based model of the natural history of HPV and cervical cancer was used to project cancer incidence and mortality, life expectancy (adjusted and unadjusted for quality of life), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (i.e., the additional cost of a strategy divided by its additional clinical benefit compared with the next most expensive strategy) associated with different cancer prevention policies, including vaccination (initiated at age 12 years), cytologic screening (initiated at 18, 21, 25, 30, or 35 years), and combined vaccination and screening strategies. We assumed that vaccination was 90% effective in reducing the risk of persistent HPV16/18 infections and evaluated alternative assumptions about vaccine efficacy, waning immunity, and risk of replacement with non-16/18 HPV types. RESULTS: Our model showed that the most effective strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than 60 dollars-000 per quality-adjusted life year is one combining vaccination at age 12 years with triennial conventional cytologic screening beginning at age 25 years, compared with the next best strategy of vaccination and cytologic screening every 5 years beginning at age 21 years. This triennial strategy would reduce the absolute lifetime risk of cervical cancer by 94% compared with no intervention. These results were sensitive to alternative assumptions about the underlying patterns of cervical cancer screening, duration of vaccine efficacy, and natural history of HPV infection in older women. CONCLUSIONS: Our model predicts that a vaccine that prevents persistent HPV16/18 infection will reduce the incidence of HPV16/18-associated cervical cancer, even in a setting of cytologic screening.

METHODS: A cost utility analysis was performed using decision analysis including a Markov state transition model. Incremental costs and effects during the children""s remaining lifetime were estimated. The model took into account the costs and success rate of treatment as well as effects of unilateral and bilateral visual impairment caused by amblyopia and other eye diseases coming along later in life on quality of life (utility). Model parameter values were obtained from the literature, and from a survey of experts. For the utility of unilateral visual impairment a base value of 0.96 was assumed. Costs were estimated from a third party payer perspective for the year 2002 in Germany. Costs and effects were discounted at 3%. Uncertainty was assessed by univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Monte-Carlo simulation). RESULTS: The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of treatment was euro2369 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). In univariate sensitivity analysis the ICER was most sensitive to uncertainty concerning the utility of unilateral visual impairment-for example, if this utility was 0.99, the ICER would be euro9148/QALY. Monte-Carlo simulation yielded a 95% uncertainty interval for the ICER of euro710/QALY to euro38 696/QALY; the probability of an ICER smaller than euro20 000/QALY was 95%.

2537,Cost-effectiveness of flexible intensive insulin management to enable dietary freedom in people with Type 1 diabetes in the UK,"AIMS: To determine the cost-effectiveness of a structured treatment and teaching programme (STTP) combining dietary freedom with insulin adjustment for Type 1 diabetes. METHODS: Incremental cost-effectiveness analysis based on effectiveness data from three RCTs in Germany, Austria, and Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) in the UK, to model the long-term microvascular complications of Type 1 diabetes. RESULTS: The STTP approach yields effectiveness gains at a lower cost compared with current standard practice for treatment of Type 1 diabetes. STTPs are likely to save 0.05 life years, yield 0.12 EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) and 0.09 visual analogue scale (VAS) incremental quality-adjusted life years, and save approximately pound 2200 per patient treated discounted over 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Introducing STTPs as standard treatment for people with Type 1 diabetes in the UK may help to achieve the primary goal of the National Service Framework (NSF) for Diabetes by enabling individuals to manage their own lifestyle and condition.

2538,Health and economic impact of combining metformin with nateglinide to achieve glycemic control: Comparison of the lifetime costs of complications in the U.K,"BACKGROUND: To reduce the likelihood of complications in persons with type 2 diabetes, it is critical to control hyperglycaemia. Monotherapy with metformin or insulin secretagogues may fail to sustain control after an initial reduction in glycemic levels. Thus, combining metformin with other agents is frequently necessary. These analyses model the potential long-term economic and health impact of using combination therapy to improve glycemic control. METHODS: An existing model that simulates the long-term course of type 2 diabetes in relation to glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and post-prandial glucose (PPG) was used to compare the combination of nateglinide with metformin to monotherapy with metformin. Complication rates were estimated for major diabetes-related complications (macrovascular and microvascular) based on existing epidemiologic studies and clinical trial data. Utilities and costs were estimated using data collected in the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). Survival, life years gained (LYG), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), complication rates and associated costs were estimated. Costs were discounted at 6% and benefits at 1.5% per year. RESULTS: Combination therapy was predicted to reduce complication rates and associated costs compared with metformin. Survival increased by 0.39 (0.32 discounted) and QALY by 0.46 years (0.37 discounted) implying costs of pound 6,772 per discounted LYG and pound 5,609 per discounted QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed the results to be consistent over broad ranges. CONCLUSION: Although drug treatment costs are increased by combination therapy, this cost is expected to be partially offset by a reduction in the costs of treating long-term diabetes complications.",2004-01-00357,15086954,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Alexandra Ward,2004,2 / 1,2,Yes,15086954,"Alexandra Ward; Maribel Salas; J Jaime Caro; David Owens; Maribel Salas; J Jaime Caro; David Owens; Health and economic impact of combining metformin with nateglinide to achieve glycemic control: Comparison of the lifetime costs of complications in the U.K, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2004-Apr-15; 2(1):1478-7547; 2",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Combination of nateglinide 360mg/day with metformin 1500mg/day,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,6.00,1.50,5609,United Kingdom,1999,14091.49
2539,Quality improvement in an outpatient department for subacute low back pain patients: prospective surveillance by outcome and performance measures in a health technology assessment perspective,"STUDY DESIGN.: Prospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To develop clinical indicators and standards in an outpatients"" department for sub acute low back pain patients. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A systematic quantitative surveillance to assess quality of care was implemented using outcome and performance measures. These measures were developed within the framework of Health Technology Assessment, which comprises the areas of healthcare technology, patient, organization, and economy. METHODS: A multidisciplinary project group defined 1) clinical indicators in terms of outcome and performance measures and 2) the corresponding standards using the available evidence from literature. Observed outcomes were compared with the standards. Associations between process and outcome measures were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 300 patients were included consecutively. In relation to technology, the standards for the field of application were fulfilled (e.g., not too many patients were x-rayed). With respect to effectiveness, the observed rate of patients reaching a 50% cutoff point of improvement of pain and function did not fulfill the standards. In relation to patient aspects, the standards of, for example, proper understanding of patient education and satisfaction, were fulfilled. In relation to organization, nearly one third of the patients were referred later to the department than the recommended 24 weeks. This refer variable showed an association to a reduced chance of scoring ""better"" or ""much better"" in ""patients global assessment."" The chance was reduced by 50% if patients were referred later than 12 weeks after onset of pain. In relation to economy, the cost of gaining a quality adjusted life-year by a course in the department was considerably lower than by comparison with total hip arthroplasty. CONCLUSIONS: Surveillance by clinical indicators in relation to the four areas of health technology assessment provides quantitative information that is meaningful for various stakeholders on important aspects of the quality of care (including consumers), provides a basis for quality improvement, and provides data for analysis of possible important relationships between structure, process, and outcome.",2004-01-00360,15082998,Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Bendt Johansen,2004,29 / 8,925-31,No,15082998,"Bendt Johansen; Jan Mainz; Svend Sabroe; Claus Manniche; Charlotte Leboeuf-Yde; Jan Mainz; Svend Sabroe; Claus Manniche; Charlotte Leboeuf-Yde; Jan Mainz; Svend Sabroe; Claus Manniche; Charlotte Leboeuf-Yde; Quality improvement in an outpatient department for subacute low back pain patients: prospective surveillance by outcome and performance measures in a health technology assessment perspective, Spine (Phila Pa 1976) Spine (Phila Pa 1976) , 2004-Apr-14; 29(8):1528-1159; 925-31",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Outpatient back care vs. Unclear,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,1850,United States,2002,2661.48

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A risk-based Markov model was developed to simulate the onset and progression of diabetic foot disease in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes managed with care according to guidelines for their lifetime. Mean survival time, quality of life, foot complications, and costs were the outcome measures assessed. Current care was the reference comparison. Data from Dutch studies on the epidemiology of diabetic foot disease, health care use, and costs, complemented with information from international studies, were used to feed the model. RESULTS: Compared with current care, guideline-based care resulted in improved life expectancy, gain of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and reduced incidence of foot complications. The lifetime costs of management of the diabetic foot following guideline-based care resulted in a cost per QALY gained of < 25,000 US dollars, even for levels of preventive foot care as low as 10%. The cost-effectiveness varied sharply, depending on the level of foot ulcer reduction attained.

2543,The management of anticoagulants in the periendoscopic period for patients with atrial fibrillation: a decision analysis,"PURPOSE: The management of patients who undergo endoscopy while being treated with warfarin is challenging. We used decision analysis to determine the preferred strategy to manage anticoagulants in the periendoscopic period. METHODS: We designed a Markov model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted survival during a 10-year period in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation undergoing screening colonoscopy. We compared six alternatives to the continue-warfarin strategy, which was to perform colonoscopy while the patient was taking full-dose warfarin. The hold-warfarin strategy was to stop warfarin 5 days before the colonoscopy. The repeat endoscopy strategy was to continue warfarin for a diagnostic colonoscopy, followed by a repeat procedure after cessation of warfarin if polypectomy was required. The dose-reduction strategy was to reduce the warfarin dose before colonoscopy. The low molecular weight heparin strategy was to administer subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin for 2 days before and 2 days after colonoscopy. The unfractionated heparin strategy was to administer intravenous unfractionated heparin for 2 days before and 2 days after the procedure. The vitamin K strategy was to hold warfarin for 4 days and to administer vitamin K if the international normalized ratio (INR) exceeded 2.0 the day before the procedure, or low molecular weight heparin if the INR was less than 1.5. RESULTS: For screening colonoscopy, assuming that polyps would be removed in 35% of examinations, the hold-warfarin and dose-reduction arms were both cost-effective strategies. The hold-warfarin arm was most cost-effective if the likelihood of polypectomy exceeded 60%, or if there was a low risk of stroke despite atrial fibrillation. The continue-warfarin strategy was preferred if the probability of polypectomy was 1% or less. CONCLUSION: Temporary warfarin cessation or halving the warfarin dose for several days before endoscopy was the preferred strategy for most patients.

2545,Screening for Hepatitis C in injecting drug users: a cost utility analysis,"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C is a major public health problem of increasing importance among injecting drug users, among whom screening has been proposed. We therefore estimated the cost utility of screening for hepatitis C infection among people with a history of injecting drug use in contact with drug misuse services. METHODS: A spreadsheet-based model of screening using ELISA followed by polymerase chain reaction tests and treatment using combination therapy with interferon alpha and ribavirin was developed. Parameters were informed by literature review, expert opinion and a survey of current screening practice in England. A range of one-way sensitivity analyses were carried out to explore uncertainty in the results for cost effectiveness. RESULTS: Screening for HCV is likely to yield benefits in the population concerned at around 28,000 pounds per quality adjusted life year. This estimate is reasonably stable when explored in extensive one-way sensitivity analysis but appeared sensitive to the proportion of HCV positive people who accept biopsy or treatment and the utility gains associated with successful drug treatment. Important other areas of uncertainty include the effects of mortality from other causes on the cost effectiveness of screening in this population and the time at which symptoms would have led to presentation in the absence of a screening programme. CONCLUSION: Screening for HCV in this population is moderately cost effective, although some caution must remain in accepting this estimate given the current uncertainties in this field, and further research is required.",2004-01-00375,15044577,J Public Health (Oxf),Ken Stein,2004,26 / 1,61-71,No,15044577,"Ken Stein; K Dalziel; Andrew Walker; Becky Jenkins; Ali Round; Pam Royle; Kim Dalziel; Andrew Walker; Becky Jenkins; Alison Round; Pam Royle; Screening for Hepatitis C in injecting drug users: a cost utility analysis, J Public Health (Oxf), 2004-Mar; 26(1):1741-3842; 61-71",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for Hepatitis C vs. No Screening,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,6.00,1.50,28120,United Kingdom,2001,59161.04

2550,Cost-effectiveness of different combinations of bupropion SR dose and behavioral treatment for smoking cessation: a societal perspective,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the differential cost effectiveness of 2 dosing regimens of bupropion sustained release (SR) in combination with behavioral interventions of minimal intensity (tailored mailings [TM]) or moderate intensity (proactive telephone calls [PTC]) for smoking cessation in an actual practice setting. STUDY DESIGN: Open-label, randomized trial, with 1-year follow-up, conducted in a large health system based in Seattle, Washington. METHODS: A total of 1524 adult smokers interested in quitting smoking were randomly assigned to receive 150 mg bupropion SR daily and PTC (n = 382), 150 mg bupropion SR daily and TM (n = 381), 300 mg bupropion SR daily and PTC (n = 383), or 300 mg bupropion SR daily and TM (n = 378). Sufficient medication for 8 weeks of dosing was provided to patients. The primary outcome measure was self-reported point-prevalence 7-day nonsmoking status at 12 months after the target quit date. RESULTS: Although the 300-mg dose was associated with a higher 12-month nonsmoking rate relative to the 150-mg dose with both PTC and TM, the additional cost resulted in lower cost effectiveness. The PTC behavioral intervention was more expensive than TM, but the additional effectiveness resulted in almost equivalent cost effectiveness at the 150-mg dose. Costs per additional 12-month nonsmoker (above that expected for placebo) for the 150-mg dose groups averaged 950 dollars and per additional lifetime quitter averaged 1508 dollars; for the 300-mg groups these costs were 1342 dollars and 2129 dollars, respectively. Cost per life-year and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved varied substantially by age and treatment, but were no greater than 1100 dollars for all treatment groups when averaged across the age and sex distribution for the study population. CONCLUSIONS: Although the cost per life-year and QALYs saved were sufficiently low for all doses to rate these smoking cessation interventions as among the most cost effective of life-saving medical treatments, within the regimens tested 150 mg bupropion combined with either PTC or TM was the most cost effective.",2004-01-00381,15032259,Am J Manag Care,Harold S Javitz,2004,10 / 3,217-26,No,15032259,"Harold S Javitz; Gary E Swan; Susan M Zbikowski; Susan J Curry; Timothy A McAfee; Donna L Decker; Richard Patterson; Lisa M Jack; Gary E Swan; Susan M Zbikowski; Susan J Curry; Timothy A McAfee; Donna L Decker; Richard Patterson; Lisa M Jack; Gary E Swan; Susan M Zbikowski; Susan J Curry; Timothy A McAfee; Donna L Decker; Richard Patterson; Lisa M Jack; Cost-effectiveness of different combinations of bupropion SR dose and behavioral treatment for smoking cessation: a societal perspective, Am J Manag Care, 2004-Mar; 10(3):1096-1860; 217-26",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bupropion SR (150mg daily) and proactive telephone calls vs. Bupropion SR (150mg daily) and tailored mailing,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,3.00,669,United States,2003,941

2553,Low back pain: influence of early MR imaging or CT on treatment and outcome--multicenter randomized trial,"PURPOSE: To establish whether early use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or computed tomography (CT) influences treatment and outcome of patients with low back pain (LBP) and whether it is cost-effective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a multicenter randomized study, two imaging policies for LBP were compared in 782 participants with symptomatic lumbar spine disorders who were referred to orthopedists or neurosurgeons. Participants were randomly allocated to early (393 participants; mean age, 43.9 years; range, 16-82 years) or delayed selective (389 participants; mean age, 42.8 years; range, 14-82 years) imaging groups. Delayed selective imaging referred to imaging restricted to patients in whom a clear clinical need subsequently developed. Main outcome measures were Aberdeen Low Back Pain (ALBP) score, Short Form 36 (SF-36) score (for multidimensional health status), EuroQol (EQ-5D) score (for quality-adjusted life-year [QALY] estimates), and healthcare resource use at 8 and 24 months after randomization. Data were evaluated with analysis of covariance, ordinal logistic regression analysis, and chi(2) and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: Both groups showed improvement in ALBP score, but this was greater in the early group (adjusted mean difference between groups, -3.05 points [95% CI: -5.16, -0.95; P =.005] and -3.62 points [95% CI: -5.92, -1.32; P =.002] at 8 and 24 months, respectively). Scores for SF-36 (bodily pain domain) and EQ-5D were also significantly better at 24 months. Clinical treatment was similar in both groups. Differences in total costs reflected cost of imaging. Imaging provided an adjusted mean additional QALY of 0.041 during 24 months at a mean incremental cost per QALY of $2,124. CONCLUSION: Early use of imaging does not appear to affect treatment overall. Decisions about the use of imaging depend on judgments concerning whether the small observed improvement in outcome justifies additional cost.",2004-01-00383,15031430,Radiology,F J Gilbert,2004,231 / 2,343-51,No,15031430,"F J Gilbert; A M Grant; M G C Gillan; Luke D Vale; M K Campbell; N W Scott; David J Knight; D Wardlaw; Fiona J Gilbert; Adrian M Grant; Maureen G C Gillan; Luke D Vale; Marion K Campbell; Neil W Scott; David J Knight; Douglas Wardlaw; Low back pain: influence of early MR imaging or CT on treatment and outcome--multicenter randomized trial, Radiology, 2004-May; 231(2):0033-8419; 343-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Early imaging vs. Delayed imaging,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,6.00,Not Stated,2124,United States,2002,3055.67
2554,Cost utility of screening and treatment for early age related macular degeneration with zinc and antioxidants,"AIM: To assess the cost effectiveness of high dose zinc and antioxidants for delaying and reducing the progression of early age related macular degeneration (AMD). BACKGROUND: AMD is the leading cause of severe vision impairment and blindness in older people throughout the developed world. It currently affects around 420 000 people in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A cost utility analysis (CUA) was conducted to estimate the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for screening a cohort of men and women, aged 55 years and over, for early AMD and then treating them with zinc and antioxidants. The incremental CUA was based on a decision analytic model, comparing screening with a no screening comparator (current practice). Extensive one way sensitivity analysis of parameters was conducted to determine the robustness of the model. RESULTS: In this model the cost effectiveness of screening for early AMD was pound 22 722 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) saved. The cost per QALY decreased to pound 18 948 if photodynamic therapy with verteporfin savings were included.

2558,Cost-effectiveness of screening with B-type natriuretic peptide to identify patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction,"OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening patients with a B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) blood test to identify those with depressed left ventricular systolic function. BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic patients with depressed ejection fraction (EF) may have less progression to heart failure if they can be identified and treated. METHODS: We used a decision model to estimate economic and health outcomes for different screening strategies using BNP and echocardiography to detect left ventricular EF <40% for men and women age 60 years. We used published data from community cohorts (gender-specific BNP test characteristics, prevalence of depressed EF) and randomized trials (benefit from treatment). RESULTS: Screening 1,000 asymptomatic patients with BNP followed by echocardiography in those with an abnormal test increased the lifetime cost of care (176,000 US dollars for men, 101,000 US dollars for women) and improved outcome (7.9 quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] for men, 1.3 QALYs for women), resulting in a cost per QALY of 22,300 US dollars for men and 77,700 US dollars for women. For populations with a prevalence of depressed EF of at least 1%, screening with BNP followed by echocardiography increased outcome at a cost < 50,000 US dollars per QALY gained. Screening would not be attractive if a diagnosis of left ventricular dysfunction led to significant decreases in quality of life or income.

DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: General practices in England and Wales. PARTICIPANTS: 401 patients with chronic headache, predominantly migraine. Interventions Patients were randomly allocated to receive up to 12 acupuncture treatments over three months from appropriately trained physiotherapists, or to usual care alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Total costs during the one year period of the study were on average higher for the acupuncture group (403 pounds sterling; 768 dollars; 598 euros) than for controls (217 pounds sterling) because of the acupuncture practitioners"" costs. The mean health gain from acupuncture during the one year of the trial was 0.021 quality adjusted life years (QALYs), leading to a base case estimate of 9180 pounds sterling per QALY gained. This result was robust to sensitivity analysis. Cost per QALY dropped substantially when the analysis incorporated likely QALY differences for the years after the trial.

2561,Cost-effectiveness of organ donation: evaluating investment into donor action and other donor initiatives,"Initiatives aimed at increasing organ donation can be considered health care interventions, and will compete with other health care interventions for limited resources. We have developed a model capable of calculating the cost-utility of organ donor initiatives and applied it to Donor Action, a successful international program designed to optimize donor practices. The perspective of the payer in the Canadian health care system was chosen. A Markov model was developed to estimate the net present value incremental lifetime direct medical costs and quality adjusted life years (QALYs) as a consequence of increased kidney transplantation rates. Cost-saving and cost-effectiveness thresholds were calculated. The effects of changing the success rate and time frame of the intervention was examined as a sensitivity analysis. Transplantation results in a gain of 1.99 QALYs and a cost savings of Can$104,000 over the 20-year time frame compared with waiting on dialysis.

2562,Cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with prostate cancer,"PURPOSE: We estimated the cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid vs placebo for decreasing skeletal complications in men with prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis alongside a multinational clinical trial of zoledronic acid. Cost estimation was based on prospectively collected resource use data for 85.3% of enrolled patients. Cost-effectiveness ratios were based on within-trial data on clinical outcomes, quality of life and study medication cost. RESULTS: Patients receiving zoledronic acid experienced fewer hospital days during a mean followup of 9 months (average 5.6 vs 8.0 days; p = 0.1910). Mean direct costs excluding study medication were US dollars 5365 for patients receiving zoledronic acid and US dollars 5689 for patients receiving placebo, a difference of US dollars 324 (95% CI US dollars 1781 to US dollars 1146). The global average cost of zoledronic acid plus its administration during the trial was US dollars 5677 (US dollars 450 per dose). The nominal cost per skeletal complication avoided was US dollars 112300 (95% CI US dollars 6900 to US dollars 48700) and the cost per additional patient free of skeletal complications was US dollars 51400 (95% CI US dollars 26900 to US dollars 243700). Nominal within-trial cost per quality adjusted life-year was US dollars 159200, which varied widely in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The nominal base case estimate of the cost per quality adjusted life-year for zoledronic acid in the prevention of skeletal complications of prostate cancer is consistent with that of bisphosphonates in breast cancer. However, the cost-effectiveness ratios for bisphosphonates are higher than commonly cited thresholds for conferring cost-effectiveness.",2004-01-00394,15017215,J Urol,Shelby D Reed,2004,171 / 4,1537-42,No,15017215,"Shelby D Reed; Jasmina I Radeva; G Alastair Glendenning; Fred Saad; Kevin A Schulman; Jasmina I Radeva; G Alastair Glendenning; Fred Saad; Kevin A Schulman; Cost-effectiveness of zoledronic acid for the prevention of skeletal complications in patients with prostate cancer, J Urol, 2004-Apr; 171(4):0022-5347; 1537-42",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Zoledronic acid vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,15 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,159200,United States,2000,239272.42

2567,Cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce vertical HIV transmission from pregnant women who have not received prenatal care,"To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of rapid HIV testing followed by treatment with zidovudine, nevirapine, or combination therapy for women presenting in the United States in active labor without prenatal care, the authors developed a decision analytic model from a societal perspective comparing 2 basic strategies: 1) not testing for HIV and 2) offering rapid HIV testing and treatment to women testing positive. HIV transmission rates, test characteristics, and costs were derived from the literature and local sources. Outcomes included number of infected infants, costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness in dollars per quality-adjusted life year saved. The authors found that offering rapid HIV testing and administering zidovudine treatment to women testing positive would prevent 27 cases of HIV each year and save $3,000,000/year compared with no intervention. If more expensive treatments were used (e.g., zidovudine rather than nevirapine, or combination therapy rather than monotherapy), the relative risk reduction in HIV transmission for the more expensive strategies would need to be only slightly better to make the more expensive strategies relatively cost effective in comparison with the less expensive strategies. In an analysis including empiric nevirapine prophylaxis, the authors found that empiric therapy would prevent 32 HIV cases and save $2.1 million per year compared with no intervention. In conclusion, rapid HIV testing and treatment for women presenting in labor without prior prenatal care would prevent HIV infections and save costs. At sites where rapid HIV testing is not possible, empiric treatment would also prevent HIV infection and saves costs and is thus preferred to a strategy of neither testing nor treating. Effectiveness in reducing transmission drives the cost-effectiveness ratio much more so than drug cost and should be the basis on which a particular prophylactic regimen is selected.",2004-01-00398,15005952,Med Decis Making,Joseph M Mrus,2004,24 / 1,30-9,No,15005952,"Joseph M Mrus; Joel Tsevat; Joel Tsevat; Cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce vertical HIV transmission from pregnant women who have not received prenatal care, Med Decis Making, 2004Jan-Feb; 24(1):0272-989X; 30-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,HIV test and subsequent treatment vs. No HIV test,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2000,Not Stated

The simulation model is based on 25 birth cohorts followed up to age 24 years, and seven epidemiological scenarios including low and high level endemicity, and one to five epidemics over a 49-year period. Epidemiological and cost data were mainly collected in the province of Quebec, Canada. Results indicate that the most effective strategy is a three-dose routine program, with the least effective strategy being mass immunization. A one-dose routine program is the most cost-effective strategy in most likely scenarios. In a societal perspective with a vaccine purchase price of CDN$ 50 per dose, the average incremental cost of the one-dose strategy would be $ 190,000 per case averted, US$ 23,000 per life-year gained, and US$ 42,000 per QALY gained.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the changes in the efficiency of neonatal intensive care for ELBW infants in Victoria, Australia over 2 decades. DESIGN: Economic evaluation (cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses) in a population-based cohort study of consecutive ELBW infants born during 4 distinct eras (1979-1980, 1985-1987, 1991-1992, and 1997) followed to at least 2 years of age.

2574,HER-2 testing and trastuzumab therapy for metastatic breast cancer: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"PURPOSE: Trastuzumab therapy has been shown to benefit metastatic breast cancer patients whose tumors exhibit HER-2 protein overexpression or gene amplification. Several tests of varying accuracy and cost are available to identify candidates for trastuzumab. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of alternative HER-2 testing and trastuzumab treatment strategies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a decision analysis using a state-transition model to simulate clinical practice in a hypothetical cohort of 65-year-old metastatic breast cancer patients. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), lifetime cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Interventions included testing with the HercepTest (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) immunohistochemical assay alone, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) alone, and both tests, followed by trastuzumab and chemotherapy for patients with positive test results and chemotherapy alone for patients with negative test results. RESULTS: In the base case, initial HercepTest with FISH confirmation of all positive results had an ICER of $125,000 per QALY gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness of initial FISH was $145,000 per QALY gained. Other strategies yielded the same or poorer effectiveness at a higher cost, or lower effectiveness at a lower cost, but with a less favorable ICER. These findings persisted under a range of assumptions, and only changes in test characteristics substantially altered results. CONCLUSION: It is more cost-effective to use FISH alone or as confirmation of all positive HercepTest results, rather than using FISH to confirm only weakly positive results or using HercepTest alone.

RESULTS: In the base case, initial HercepTest with FISH confirmation of all positive results had an ICER of $125,000 per QALY gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness of initial FISH was $145,000 per QALY gained. Other strategies yielded the same or poorer effectiveness at a higher cost, or lower effectiveness at a lower cost, but with a less favorable ICER. These findings persisted under a range of assumptions, and only changes in test characteristics substantially altered results. CONCLUSION: It is more cost-effective to use FISH alone or as confirmation of all positive HercepTest results, rather than using FISH to confirm only weakly positive results or using HercepTest alone.

2580,Cost-effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease according to disease severity,"PURPOSE: Inhaled corticosteroids reduce exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but their cost-effectiveness is not known. METHODS: We used a Markov model to determine, from a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of four treatment strategies involving inhaled corticosteroids: no use regardless of COPD severity; use in all disease stages; use in patients with stage 2 or 3 disease (forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV(1)] <50% of predicted); and use in patients with stage 3 disease (FEV(1) <35% of predicted). Data from the literature were used to estimate mortality, exacerbation, and disease progression rates, as well as the costs associated with care and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), according to disease stage and use or nonuse of inhaled corticosteroids. A time horizon of 3 years was used. RESULTS: Use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with stage 2 or 3 disease was associated with a cost of 17,000 dollars per QALY gained. In stage 3 patients, use resulted in a cost of 11,100 dollars per QALY gained. Providing inhaled corticosteroids to all COPD patients was associated with a less favorable cost-effectiveness ratio.

2583,"Cost-effectiveness of nucleic acid test screening of volunteer blood donations for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus in the United States","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of adding nucleic acid testing (NAT) to serological (antibody and antigen) screening protocols for donated blood in the United States (US) with the purpose of reducing the risks of transfusion-transmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The costs, health consequences and cost-effectiveness of adding either minipool or individual-donor NAT to serological screening (SS) testing were estimated using a decision-analysis model. RESULTS: With the given modelling assumptions, adding minipool NAT would avoid an estimated 37, 128 and eight cases of HBV, HCV and HIV, respectively, and save approximately 53 additional years of life and 102 additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with SS, at a net cost of $154 million.

2585,Cost-effectiveness of cognitive behaviour therapy for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome,"BACKGROUND: There is some evidence that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is efficacious in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), but little data on its cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: Prospective economic analysis alongside a randomized clinical trial. METHODS: CFS patients were randomly assigned to CBT, guided support groups (SG), or the ""natural course"" (NC, no protocol-based interventions). Patients were treated for 8 months and followed-up for another 6 months. Costs per patient showing clinically significant improvement, based on the CIS fatigue scale, and costs per quality-adjusted life year, were determined for a time period of 14 months. RESULTS: Data were available for 171 patients at 8 months and for 128 at 14 months. At 8 and 14 months, the percentages of improved patients were 31% and 27% for CBT, 9% and 11% for SG, and 12% and 20% for NC. Mean QALYs gained at 14 months were, for CBT, SG and NC, respectively, 0.0737, -0.0018 and 0.0458. CBT and SG mean treatment costs were euro1490 and euro424.

2587,Payment for living donor (vendor) kidneys: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"The supply of kidneys does not meet the demand. As a consequence, the waiting time for a cadaver kidney continues to lengthen, and there is renewed debate about payment for living donors. To facilitate this debate, we studied what amount of payment would be cost-effective for society, i.e. what costs would be saved (if any) by removing a patient from the waiting list using a paid (living unrelated: LURD) donor-vendor. A Markov model was developed to calculate the expected average cost and outcome benefits of increasing the organ supply and reducing waiting times by adding paid LURD organs to the available pool. We found that a LURD transplant saved $94,579 (US dollars, 2002), and 3.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were gained. Adding the value of QALYs, a LURD transplant saved $269 319, assuming society values additional QALYs from transplantation at the rate paid per QALY while on dialysis.

2588,Cost effectiveness of peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin versus interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin as initial therapy for treatment-naive chronic hepatitis C,"INTRODUCTION: In adults with previously untreated chronic hepatitis C (CHC), the combination of peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin produces a higher rate of sustained virological response (SVR) than interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin, but it is still unproven whether this increase is cost effective. The objective of this study was to determine if the gain in SVR with peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin is worth the incremental cost. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model of disease progression in which cohorts of patients received peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin or interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin for 48 weeks (hepatitis C virus [HCV] genotype 1 and non-1 patients with fibrosis) or 24 weeks (genotype non-1 patients without fibrosis), and were followed for their expected lifetimes. The reference patient was a 45-year-old male with CHC without cirrhosis. The SVRs with peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin and interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin used to populate the model were 46% and 36% for patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and 76% and 61% for patients infected with HCV non-1 genotypes, respectively. QOL and costs for each health state were based on literature estimates and on Italian treatment patterns. Costs were in 2002 euros and benefits were discounted at 3%. Sensitivity analyses on key clinical and economic parameters were performed. The analysis was reported from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service. RESULTS: In patients infected with HCV genotype 1, peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin increased life-years (LYs) by 0.78 years and QALYs by 0.67 years, compared with interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin.

However, use of aspirin is associated with numerous potential complications, including gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic strokes. We used a modeling approach to determine and compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of aspirin with and without endoscopic surveillance to prevent esophageal adenocarcinoma. METHODS: A Markov Monte Carlo decision model was constructed to compare four strategies for management of Barrett""s esophagus: aspirin therapy, endoscopic surveillance with biopsies, both, or neither. Patients who took a daily enteric-coated aspirin were modeled to have a 50% reduction in the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma but could have complications related to therapy, at which point the aspirin was discontinued. Potential cardiac benefits of aspirin and its role in the chemoprevention of other cancers were not included in the analysis. The analysis was from a societal perspective from age 55 years until death. Sensitivity analyses were performed to investigate the effects of changes in model parameters on estimated costs and effectiveness outcomes across a wide range of assumptions. RESULTS: Aspirin therapy was more effective and less costly than no therapy, resulting in 0.19 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The combination of aspirin and endoscopic surveillance produced 0.27 more QALYs than no therapy at a cost of 13,400 U.S. dollars more, for an associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 49,600 U.S. dollars/QALY.

2595,Cost-utility analysis of orthoptic screening in kindergarten: a Markov model based on data from Germany,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical screening program for untreated amblyopia in 3-year-old children conducted by orthoptists in all German kindergartens in the year 2000. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was performed for which a decision tree was combined with a Markov model. Incremental costs and effects during the children""s remaining lifetime were estimated. The model took into account the probability of treatment without screening, age-specific treatment success rates, costs of screening and treatment, as well as effects of unilateral and bilateral visual impairment caused by amblyopia and other eye diseases coming along later in life on quality of life (utility). Model parameter values were obtained from a field study of orthoptic screening in kindergarten, from the literature, and from expert interviews. Costs were estimated from a third-party payer perspective. Uncertainty was assessed by univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (Monte Carlo simulation). RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of orthoptic screening was 7397 Euro (euro) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) when costs and effects were discounted at 5%. In univariate sensitivity analysis, the ICER was sensitive to the uncertainty regarding the utility of unilateral visual impairment and to the discount rate for effects; besides uncertainty regarding the prevalence of untreated amblyopia, the odds ratio of success of treatment when started late, and the probability of treatment without screening had a noticeable but much smaller effect. Monte Carlo simulation yielded a 90% uncertainty interval for the ICER of 3452 euro/QALY to 72 637 euro/QALY; the probability of an ICER <25 000 euro/QALY was 84%. CONCLUSIONS: The ICER of orthoptic screening seems to fall within a range that warrants careful consideration by decision-makers. Much of the uncertainty in results comes from the uncertainty regarding the effect of amblyopia on quality of life. To reduce this uncertainty, the impact of amblyopia on utility should be investigated.",2004-01-00445,14754978,Pediatrics,H-H König,2004,113 / 2,e95-108,No,14754978,"H-H König; J-C Barry; Hans-Helmut König; Jean-Cyriaque Barry; Cost-utility analysis of orthoptic screening in kindergarten: a Markov model based on data from Germany, Pediatrics, 2004-Feb; 113(2):1098-4275; e95-108",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Orthoptic screening for amblyopia including cover tests, exam of eye motility and head posture, and uncorrected monocular visual acuity testing",Not Stated,3 Years,3 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,7397,Euro,2000,10263.44
2596,Preferences and willingness to pay for health states prevented by pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,"OBJECTIVE: To measure parents"" and other adults"" values for preventing disease associated with pneumococcal infection and to evaluate how including these values changes the economic appraisal of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. METHODS: Data on preferences and willingness to pay to reduce risk of illness were collected for 6 illnesses that are preventable by pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (simple otitis media, complex otitis media, moderate pneumonia, severe pneumonia, bacteremia, and meningitis) and 1 vaccine-related adverse event (fever and fussiness after vaccine). Interviews were conducted with 2 groups of respondents: 1) parents of children who had experienced 1 or more of the outcomes described in the survey (n = 101) and 2) a US community sample (n = 109). The 30-minute telephone interview used modified time trade-off questions and willingness-to-pay questions. Values from the interview were incorporated in an existing decision-analytic model that simulated the cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in a hypothetical cohort of newborns. RESULTS: Among parents, the median amount of time that respondents said that they would be willing to trade to avoid diseases ranged from 0 days for otitis media to 1 year for severe pneumonia and 2 years for meningitis. Among the US community sample, the median amounts of time traded were higher, ranging from 7 days for otitis media to 3 years for meningitis. Median willingness-to-pay amounts varied from 100 dollars to prevent 1 episode of otitis media and 500 dollars to reduce the risk of meningitis from 21 in 100 000 to 6 in 100 000 and were similar between parents and community members. Incorporating time trade-off amounts into the existing economic model for pneumococcal conjugate vaccine resulted in cost-effectiveness ratios <10 000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year at a vaccine cost of 58 dollars per dose. CONCLUSIONS: Both parents and community members assign relatively high values to preventing meningitis, pneumonia, and complex otitis media.

2597,Cost utility of prenatal diagnosis and the risk-based threshold,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal testing guidelines recommend offering amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling to women aged 35 years or older, or who have been found by screening to be at a similarly high risk of giving birth to an infant with Down""s syndrome or another chromosomal abnormality. This threshold was chosen, in part, because 35 was the approximate age at which amniocentesis was cost beneficial when testing guidelines were developed in the USA in the 1970s. We aimed to assess the economic validity of thresholds based on age or risk for offering invasive prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: We did a cost-utility analysis of chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis versus no invasive testing using data from randomised trials, case registries, and a utility assessment of 534 diverse pregnant women aged 16-47 years. FINDINGS: In the USA, compared with no diagnostic testing, amniocentesis costs less than US15000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year gained for women of all ages and risk levels. The results do not depend on maternal age or risk of Down""s syndrome-affected birth. The cost-utility ratio for any individual woman depends on her preferences for reassurance about the chromosomal status of her fetus, and, to a lesser extent, for miscarriage.

The results do not depend on maternal age or risk of Down""s syndrome-affected birth. The cost-utility ratio for any individual woman depends on her preferences for reassurance about the chromosomal status of her fetus, and, to a lesser extent, for miscarriage. INTERPRETATION: Prenatal diagnostic testing can be cost effective at any age or risk level. Current guidelines should be changed to offer testing to all pregnant women, not just those whose risk of carrying an affected fetus exceeds a specified threshold.",2004-01-00450,14751700,Lancet,Ryan A Harris,2004,363 / 9405,276-82,No,14751700,"Ryan A Harris; A Eugene Washington; Robert F Nease; Miriam Kuppermann; A Eugene Washington; Robert F Nease; Miriam Kuppermann; Cost utility of prenatal diagnosis and the risk-based threshold, Lancet, 2004-Jan-24; 363(9405):0140-6736; 276-82",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Amniocentesis vs. No testing,Not Stated,20 Years,20 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,14200,United States,2003,19973.46
2599,Cost utility of prenatal diagnosis and the risk-based threshold,"BACKGROUND: Prenatal testing guidelines recommend offering amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling to women aged 35 years or older, or who have been found by screening to be at a similarly high risk of giving birth to an infant with Down""s syndrome or another chromosomal abnormality. This threshold was chosen, in part, because 35 was the approximate age at which amniocentesis was cost beneficial when testing guidelines were developed in the USA in the 1970s. We aimed to assess the economic validity of thresholds based on age or risk for offering invasive prenatal diagnosis.
