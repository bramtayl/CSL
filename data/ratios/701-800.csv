701,Cost-effectiveness of treatments for major depression in primary care practice,"BACKGROUND: This study augments a randomized controlled trial to analyze the cost-effectiveness of 2 standardized treatments for major depression relative to each other and to the ""usual care"" provided by primary care physicians. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in which primary care patients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for current major depression were assigned to pharmacotherapy (where nortriptyline hydrochloride was given) or interpersonal psychotherapy provided in a standardized framework or a primary physician's usual care. Two outcome measures, depression-free days and quality-adjusted days, were developed using information on depressive symptoms over time. The costs of care were calculated. Cost-effectiveness ratios comparing the incremental outcomes with the incremental costs for the different treatments were estimated. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In terms of both economic costs and quality-of-life outcomes, patients assigned to the pharmacotherapy group did slightly better than those assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy. Both standardized therapies provided better outcomes than primary physician's usual care, but each consumed more resources. No meaningful cost-offsets were found. The incremental direct cost per additional depression-free day for pharmacotherapy relative to usual care ranges from $12.66 to $16.87 which translates to direct cost per quality-adjusted year gained from $11270 to $19510. CONCLUSIONS: Standardized treatments for depression lead to better outcomes than usual care but also lead to higher costs. However, the estimates of the cost per quality-of-life year gained for standardized pharmacotherapy are comparable with those found for other treatments provided in routine practice.",1998-01-01968,9672056,Arch Gen Psychiatry,J R Lave,1998,55 / 7,645-51,No,9672056,"J R Lave; R G Frank; H C Schulberg; M S Kamlet; Cost-effectiveness of treatments for major depression in primary care practice, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 1998-Jul; 55(7):0003-990X; 645-51",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,interpersonal psychotherapy vs. Primary physician usual care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,28700,United States,1995,48739.34
702,Cost-effectiveness of therapies for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: The most appropriate treatment(s) for patients with atrial fibrillation remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of anti-thrombotic and antiarrhythmic treatment strategies for atrial fibrillation. METHODS: We performed decision and cost-effectiveness analyses using a Markov state transition model. We gathered data from the English-language literature using MEDLINE searches and bibliographies from selected articles. We obtained financial data from nationwide physician-fee references, a medical center's cost accounting system, and one of New England's larger managed care organizations. We examined strategies that included combinations of cardioversion, antiarrhythmic therapy with quinidine, sotalol hydrochloride, or amiodarone, and anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy. RESULTS: For a 65-year-old man with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, any intervention results in a significant gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) compared with no specific therapy. Use of aspirin results in the largest incremental gain (1.2 QALYs). Cardioversion followed by the use of amiodarone and warfarin together is the most effective strategy, yielding a gain of 2.3 QALYs compared with no specific therapy. The marginal cost-effectiveness ratios of cardioversion followed by aspirin, with or without amiodarone, are $33800 per QALY and $10800 per QALY, respectively. Cardioversion followed by amiodarone and warfarin has a marginal cost-effectiveness ratio of $92400 per QALY compared with amiodarone and aspirin. Strategies that include cardioversion followed by either quinidine or sotalol are both more expensive and less effective than competing strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Cardioversion of patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation followed by the use of aspirin alone or with amiodarone has a reasonable marginal cost-effectiveness ratio. While cardioversion followed by the use of amiodarone and warfarin results in the greatest gain in quality-adjusted life expectancy, it is expensive (ie, has a high marginal cost-effectiveness ratio) compared with aspirin and amiodarone.

Combinatietherapie Bij Reumatoïde Artritis","OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of early intervention in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, with combined step-down prednisolone, methotrexate and sulphasalazine, compared to sulphasalazine alone. METHODS: Multicentre 56 week randomized double-blind trial with full economic analysis of direct costs and utility analysis with rating scale and standard gamble measurement techniques. RESULTS: The combined-treatment group included 76 patients and the sulphasalazine group 78 patients. The mean total costs per patient in the first 56 weeks of follow-up were $5519 for combined treatment and $6511 for treatment with sulphasalazine alone (P = 0.37). Out-patient care, in-patient care and non-health care each contributed about one-third to the total costs. The combined-treatment group appeared to generate savings in the length of hospital stay for RA, non-protocol drugs and costs of home help, but comparisons were not statistically significant. Protocol drugs and monitoring were slightly more expensive in the combined-treatment group. Clinical, radiographic and functional outcomes significantly favoured combined treatment at week 28 (radiography also at week 56). Utility scores also favoured combined treatment.

708,A cost-utility analysis comparing omeprazole with ranitidine in the maintenance therapy of peptic esophageal stricture,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that patients receiving omeprazole for prophylaxis against peptic esophageal stricture recurrence have less dysphagia and require fewer repeat dilations than patients receiving ranitidine. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental utility gain and associated incremental cost of omeprazole compared with those of ranitidine for the maintenance therapy of patients with peptic stricture who required esophageal dilation. METHODS: Decision analysis using SMLTREE software was used to compare the incremental cost-utility of omeprazole 20 mg once daily with that of ranitidine 150 mg bid for one year. Variables were estimated from the literature, hospital data, and utility analyses involving patients with peptic stricture and health professionals. The primary outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: The incremental cost of omeprazole compared with that of ranitidine was $556 per patient treated. The incremental utility gain of omeprazole was 0.0112 QALYs. Overall, the incremental cost:utility ratio of omeprazole in the maintenance therapy of patients with peptic stricture was $49,600 per QALY gained. A sensitivity analysis revealed that the estimates with the greatest impact on the cost:utility ratio were disutility associated with dysphagia and dilation, the probability of requiring redilation and the cost of medications. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole 20 mg once daily is associated with greater utility and higher cost than ranitidine 150 mg bid when used as prophylaxis against stricture recurrence.

715,Cost-effectiveness of lung transplantation in The Netherlands: a scenario analysis,"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To calculate cost-effectiveness of scenarios concerning lung transplantation in The Netherlands. DESIGN: Microsimulation model predicting survival, quality of life, and costs with and without transplantation program, based on data of the Dutch lung transplantation program of 1990 to 1995. SETTING: Netherlands, University Hospital Groningen. PATIENTS: Included were 425 patients referred for lung transplantation, of whom 57 underwent transplantation. INTERVENTION: Lung transplantation. RESULTS: For the baseline scenario, the costs per life-year gained are G 194,000 (G=Netherlands guilders) and the costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained are G 167,000. Restricting patient inflow (""policy scenario"") lowers the costs per life-year gained: G 172,000 (costs per QALY gained: G 144,000). The supply of more donor lungs could reduce the costs per life-year gained to G 159,000 (G 135,000 per QALY gained; G1 =US $0.6, based on exchange rate at the time of the study). CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation is an expensive but effective intervention: survival and quality of life improve substantially after transplantation. The costs per life-year gained are relatively high, compared with other interventions and other types of transplantation. Restricting the patient inflow and/or raising donor supply improves cost-effectiveness to some degree.

RESULTS: For the baseline scenario, the costs per life-year gained are G 194,000 (G=Netherlands guilders) and the costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained are G 167,000. Restricting patient inflow (""policy scenario"") lowers the costs per life-year gained: G 172,000 (costs per QALY gained: G 144,000).

CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation is an expensive but effective intervention: survival and quality of life improve substantially after transplantation. The costs per life-year gained are relatively high, compared with other interventions and other types of transplantation.

718,A 1-year community-based health economic study of ciprofloxacin vs usual antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: the Canadian Ciprofloxacin Health Economic Study Group,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the costs, consequences, effectiveness, and safety of ciprofloxacin vs standard antibiotic care in patients with an initial acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) as well as recurrent AECBs over a 1-year period. DESIGN: Randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, open-label study. SETTING: Outpatient general practice. PATIENTS: A total of 240 patients, 18 years or older with chronic bronchitis, with a history of frequent exacerbations (three or more in the past year) presenting with a type 1 or 2 AECB (two or more of increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume, or sputum purulence). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The assessment included AECB symptoms, antibiotics prescribed, concomitant medications, adverse events, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, outpatient resources such as diagnostic tests, procedures, and patient and caregiver out-of-pocket expenses. Patients completed the Nottingham Health Profile, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, and the Health Utilities Index. The parameters were recorded with each AECB and at regular quarterly intervals for 1 year. These variables were compared between the ciprofloxacin-treated group and the usual-care-treated group. RESULTS: Patients receiving ciprofloxacin experienced a median of two AECBs per patient compared to a median of three AECBs per patient receiving usual care. The mean annualized total number of AECB-symptom days was 42.9+/-2.8 in the ciprofloxacin arm compared to 45.6+/-3.0 days in the usual-care arm (p=0.50). The overall duration of the average AECB was 15.2+/-0.6 days for the ciprofloxacin arm compared to 16.3+/-0.6 days for the usual-care arm. Treatment with ciprofloxacin tended to accelerate the resolution of all AECBs compared to usual care (relative risk=1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91 to 1.58; p=0.19). Treatment assignment did not affect the interexacerbation period but a history of severe bronchitis, prolonged chronic bronchitis, and an increased number of AECBs in the past year were associated with shorter exacerbations-free periods. There was a slight, but not statistically significant, improvement in all quality of life measures with ciprofloxacin over usual care. The only factors predictive of hospitalization were duration of chronic bronchitis (odds ratio=4.6; 95% CI, 1.6, 13.0) and severity of chronic bronchitis (odds ratio=4.3; 95% CI, 0.8, 24.6). The incremental cost difference of $578 Canadian in favor of usual care was not significant (95% CI, -$778, $1,932). The cost for the ciprofloxacin arm over the usual care arm was $18,588 Canadian per quality-adjusted life year gained. When the simple base case analysis was expanded to examine the effect of risk stratification, the presence of moderate or severe bronchitis and at least four AECBs in the previous year changed the economic and clinical analysis to one favorable to ciprofloxacin with the ciprofloxacin-treated group having a better clinical outcome at lower cost (""win-win"" scenario). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with ciprofloxacin tended to accelerate the resolution of all AECBs compared to usual care; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Further, usual care was found to be more reflective of best available care rather than usual first-line agents such as amoxicillin, tetracycline, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole as originally expected. Despite the similar antimicrobial activities and broad-spectrum coverage of both ciprofloxacin and usual care, the trends in clinical outcomes and all quality of life measurements favor ciprofloxacin. In patients suffering from an AECB with a history of moderate to severe chronic bronchitis and at least four AECBs in the previous year, ciprofloxacin treatment offered substantial clinical and economic benefits. In these patients, ciprofloxacin may be the preferred first antimicrobial choice.",1998-01-01976,9440580,Chest,R Grossman,1998,113 / 1,131-41,No,9440580,"R Grossman; J Mukherjee; D Vaughan; C Eastwood; R Cook; J LaForge; N Lampron; A 1-year community-based health economic study of ciprofloxacin vs usual antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis: the Canadian Ciprofloxacin Health Economic Study Group, Chest, 1998-Jan; 113(1):0012-3692; 131-41",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg bid) vs. Usual care (antibiotic or combination of antibiotics other than a quinolone),Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,18588,Canada,1996,22483.22

722,Potential cost-effectiveness of public access defibrillation in the United States,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 360,000 Americans experience sudden cardiac arrest each year; current treatments are expensive and not very effective. Public access defibrillation (PAD) is a novel treatment for out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest that refers to use of automated external defibrillators by the lay public or by nonmedical personnel such as police. A clinical trial has been proposed to evaluate the effectiveness of public access defibrillation, but it is unclear whether such early defibrillation will offer sufficient value for money. Our objective was to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of public access defibrillation by use of decision analysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: A decision model compared the potential cost-effectiveness of standard emergency medical services (EMS) systems with that of EMS supplemented by PAD. We considered defibrillation by lay responders or police, using an analysis with a US health-care perspective. Input data were derived from published data or fiscal databases. Future costs and effects were discounted at 3%. Monte Carlo simulation was performed to estimate the variability in the costs and effects of each program. Sensitivity analyses assessed the robustness of the results to changes in input data. A standard EMS system had a median cost of $5900 per cardiac arrest patient (interquartile range, IQR, $3200 to $10,900) and yielded a median of 0.25 quality-adjusted life years (IQR, 0.20 to 0.30). PAD by lay responders had a median incremental cost of $44,000 per additional quality-adjusted life year (IQR, $29,000 to $68,900). PAD by police had a median incremental cost of $27,200 per additional quality-adjusted life year (IQR, $15,700 to $47,800). The results were sensitive to changes in the cost and relative survival benefit of PAD.

725,Adjunctive lamotrigine therapy in patients with refractory seizures: a lifetime cost-utility analysis,"OBJECTIVE: Lamotrigine as add-on treatment (500 mg per day) is effective in patients with refractory epilepsy, but its high cost requires a pharmacoeconomic analysis. We conducted a retrospective lifetime cost utility study in which clinical data were derived from a recent placebo-controlled clinical trial, cost-of-illness data were drawn from a previous ad-hoc study, and quality-of-life values were obtained by prospectively interviewing a separate group of 81 patients referred to our institution with epilepsy. RESULTS: Our analysis showed that chronic lamotrigine treatment implies an incremental lifetime cost of about $1,600,000 for every 100 patients. Incremental lifetime utility was around 40 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for every 100 patients. On the basis of these data, adjunctive lamotrigine was estimated to cost approximately $41,000 per QALY gained. Sensitivity testing suggested a range of $25,000-$85,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Adjunctive lamotrigine (500 mg per day) in refractory epilepsy seems to have a worse pharmacoeconomic profile than many pharmacological treatments commonly used in areas other than epilepsy. Further data are needed to determine if lamotrigine can be equally effective at lower (and less costly) daily doses which could markedly improve its pharmacoeconomic characteristics.",1998-01-01980,9551700,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,A Messori,1998,53 / 6,421-7,No,9551700,"A Messori; S Trippoli; P Becagli; M Cincotta; M G Labbate; G Zaccara; Adjunctive lamotrigine therapy in patients with refractory seizures: a lifetime cost-utility analysis, Eur J Clin Pharmacol, 1998-Feb; 53(6):0031-6970; 421-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lamotrigine vs. No Lamotrigine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,6.00,6.00,41343,United States,1992,76265.31
726,Domiciliary liquid oxygen versus concentrator treatment in chronic hypoxaemia: a cost-utility analysis,"Whether long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves quality of life in chronic hypoxaemia has been questioned. LTOT with an oxygen concentrator (C/C) and gas cylinders for ambulation is considered cumbersome compared to mobile liquid oxygen equipment (L). The hypothesis for this study was that LTOT with liquid oxygen treatment (L) improves patients' health-related quality of life, but that it is also more expensive compared to concentrator (C/C) treatment. A prospective, randomized multicentre trial comparing C/C with L for LTOT was conducted during a six-month period. Fifty-one patients (29 on L and 22 on C/C) with chronic hypoxaemia, regularly active outside the home, participated in the study initially. Costs for oxygen were obtained from the pharmacies. Patient diaries and telephone contacts with members of the healthcare sector were used to estimate costs. Health-related quality of life was measured by the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the EuroQol, instruments at the start and after 6 months. The average total cost per patient for group C/C for the six-month period was US$1,310, and for group L it was US$4,950. Health-related quality of life measured by the SIP instrument showed significant differences in favour of group L in the categories/dimensions of physical function, body care, ambulation, social interaction and total SIP score. In conclusion, liquid-oxygen treatment was more expensive compared to concentrator treatment.

729,Economic evaluation of end stage renal disease treatment,"This paper examines the cost-effectiveness of end stage renal disease (ESRD) treatments. Empirical data on costs of treatment modalities and quality of life of patients were gathered alongside a clinical trial and combined with data on patient and technique survival from the Dutch Renal Replacement Registry. A Markov-chain model, based on the actual Dutch ESRD program as of January 1st 1997, predicted the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of dialysis and transplantation over the 5-year period 1997-2001. Total annual costs amounted to DFL 650 million (1.1% of the health care budget). Centre Haemodialysis was found to be the least cost-effective treatment, while transplantation and Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) were the most cost-effective treatments. The Markov-chain model was used to study the influence of substitutive policies on the overall cost-effectiveness of the ESRD treatment program. The influence of such policies was found to be modest in the Dutch context, where a high percentage of patients is already being treated with more cost-effective treatment modalities. In countries where Centre Haemodialysis is still the only or the major treatment option for ESRD patients, substitutive policies might have a more substantial impact on cost-effectiveness of ESRD treatment.",1998-01-01983,10182294,Health Policy,G A de Wit,1998,44 / 3,215-32,No,10182294,"G A de Wit; P G Ramsteijn; F T de Charro; Economic evaluation of end stage renal disease treatment, Health Policy, 1998-Jun; 44(3):0168-8510; 215-32",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,End stage renal disease treatments vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,98300,Netherlands,1996,96194.93
730,Multiple outcome assessment in a study of the cost-effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVE: To develop new methods for combining results from multiple outcome domains and to demonstrate their application in a study of the cost-effectiveness of clozapine in treating hospitalized patients with refractory schizophrenia. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Interview assessments, and administrative utilization and cost data, concerning 423 patients with refractory schizophrenia who had been hospitalized for 30-364 days during the year before study entry, at 15 VA medical centers. STUDY DESIGN: A 12-month double-blind trial compared clozapine (n = 205) and haloperidol (n = 218) in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data from standard assessment instruments, gathered at baseline and at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, were used to develop a Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia, a measure that addresses outcome in six domains, weighted by patient or provider preferences. Cumulative improvement was estimated by computing the area under the improvement curve. This measure was then combined with cost data, reflecting consumption of societal resources to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Clozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol on measures of symptoms (p = .02) and side effects (p < .0001), with nonsignificant trends in the positive direction on community role functioning (p = .06), family relationships (p = .23), social relationships (p = .30), and daily activities (p = .20). Clozapine was also more effective than haloperidol on the one-year cumulative Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia (p < .0001 for all weighting schemes). After converting this measure to a 0-1 Worst Health-Good Health Scale analogous to Quality Adjusted Life Years, clozapine was found to yield a small improvement of .049 Worst Health-Good Health Units as compared to an improvement of only .027 Units for haloperidol (p < .0001). Average annual costs were $2,733 lower for clozapine (95% C.I. = -$9,220 to $3,754). Although clozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol, the summary cost-effectiveness ratio had a wide 95 percent confidence interval ranging from -$431,585 to $177,352.

731,Multiple outcome assessment in a study of the cost-effectiveness of clozapine in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study Group on Clozapine in Refractory Schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVE: To develop new methods for combining results from multiple outcome domains and to demonstrate their application in a study of the cost-effectiveness of clozapine in treating hospitalized patients with refractory schizophrenia. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Interview assessments, and administrative utilization and cost data, concerning 423 patients with refractory schizophrenia who had been hospitalized for 30-364 days during the year before study entry, at 15 VA medical centers. STUDY DESIGN: A 12-month double-blind trial compared clozapine (n = 205) and haloperidol (n = 218) in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Data from standard assessment instruments, gathered at baseline and at 6 weeks, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, were used to develop a Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia, a measure that addresses outcome in six domains, weighted by patient or provider preferences. Cumulative improvement was estimated by computing the area under the improvement curve. This measure was then combined with cost data, reflecting consumption of societal resources to estimate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Clozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol on measures of symptoms (p = .02) and side effects (p < .0001), with nonsignificant trends in the positive direction on community role functioning (p = .06), family relationships (p = .23), social relationships (p = .30), and daily activities (p = .20). Clozapine was also more effective than haloperidol on the one-year cumulative Composite Health Index for Schizophrenia (p < .0001 for all weighting schemes). After converting this measure to a 0-1 Worst Health-Good Health Scale analogous to Quality Adjusted Life Years, clozapine was found to yield a small improvement of .049 Worst Health-Good Health Units as compared to an improvement of only .027 Units for haloperidol (p < .0001). Average annual costs were $2,733 lower for clozapine (95% C.I. = -$9,220 to $3,754). Although clozapine was significantly more effective than haloperidol, the summary cost-effectiveness ratio had a wide 95 percent confidence interval ranging from -$431,585 to $177,352. CONCLUSIONS: Methods demonstrate an approach to using conventional disease-specific measures to evaluate the cumulative effectiveness of novel treatments for psychotic disorders and for expressing their economic effect as cost-effectiveness ratios.

734,A cost-utility analysis of abdominal hysterectomy versus transcervical endometrial resection for the surgical treatment of menorrhagia,"Menorrhagia, or heavy regular menstrual bleeding, represents a major health burden to women. Trials comparing abdominal hysterectomy (AH) with transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) for the condition have shown that, although the duration and severity of convalescence is less with TCRE, AH produces a permanent solution to heavy bleeding while TCRE fails in a proportion of women by 2 years. However, by 2 years, TCRE costs only 71% that of AH. This paper presents a cost-utility analysis to assess which procedure is more cost-effective overall. Under most plausible parameter values and on the basis of health state values elicited from a sample of women with menorrhagia, AH is likely to be considered more cost-effective than TCRE if purchasers are willing to pay an additional cost of at least 6,500 Pounds per extra quality-adjusted life-year generated by AH.",1998-01-01987,9611905,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,M Sculpher,1998,14 / 2,302-19,No,9611905,"M Sculpher; A cost-utility analysis of abdominal hysterectomy versus transcervical endometrial resection for the surgical treatment of menorrhagia, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 1998; 14(2):0266-4623; 302-19",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Abdominal hysterectomy vs. Transcervical resection of the endometrium using diathermy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,2 Years,6.00,6.00,1500,United Kingdom,1994,4012.76

736,Economic evaluation of an HIV prevention intervention for gay and bisexual male adolescents,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an HIV prevention intervention for gay and bisexual male adolescents. The intervention included individualized risk assessment and counseling, peer education, optional HIV testing, and referrals to needed services. From 1989 to 1994, 501 male volunteers, 13 to 21 years of age, who self-identified as gay/bisexual or as having had sex with men, completed preintervention and postintervention surveys to assess changes in HIV risk behavior. An HIV transmission model was constructed to project the HIV seroprevalence in the target population over a 10-year period from the self-reported number of partners for unprotected anal intercourse. Cost-effectiveness was analyzed from a societal perspective. Total costs of the intervention, including medical treatment costs saved, were projected to be $1.1 million U.S. for the 10-year period. The number of HIV infections averted and the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved were projected to be 13 and 180, respectively. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was projected to be $6180 U.S. per QALY saved. The intervention was found to be cost-effective from the societal perspective. In addition, HIV prevalence in the target population was projected to be 6.1% without and 5.6% with intervention by the end of the 10-year period.

737,Cost-effectiveness analysis of invasive and noninvasive tests in high risk patients treated with amiodarone after acute myocardial infarction,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate 1) the cost-effectiveness of amiodarone therapy in postinfarction patients; and 2) the influence of alternative diagnostic strategies (noninvasive only vs. noninvasive and electrophysiologic testing) on survival benefit and cost-effectiveness ratio of amiodarone therapy. BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of amiodarone therapy in postinfarction patients is still unknown, and no study has determined which diagnostic strategy should be used to maximize amiodarone survival benefit while improving its cost-effectiveness ratio. METHODS: We designed a postinfarction scenario wherein heart rate variability analysis on 24-h Holter monitoring was used as a screening test for 2-year amiodarone therapy in a cohort of survivors (mean age 57 years) of a recent myocardial infarction. Three different therapeutic strategies were compared: 1) no amiodarone; 2) amiodarone in patients with depressed heart rate variability; 3) amiodarone in patients with depressed heart rate variability and a positive programmed ventricular stimulation. Total variable costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy during a 20-year period were predicted with use of a Markov simulation model. Costs and charges were calculated with reference to an Italian and American hospital. RESULTS: Amiodarone therapy in patients with depressed heart rate variability and a positive programmed ventricular stimulation was dominated by a blend of the two alternatives. Compared with the no-treatment strategy, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of amiodarone therapy in patients with depressed heart rate variability was $10,633 and $39,422 per gained quality-adjusted life-year using Italian costs and American charges, respectively.

739,Economic evaluation of chemotherapy with mitoxantrone plus prednisone for symptomatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer: based on a Canadian randomized trial with palliative end points,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the economic consequences of the use of chemotherapy in patients with symptomatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer (HRPC) in the context of a previously published Canadian open-label, phase III, randomized trial with palliative end points. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The trial randomized 161 patients to initial treatment with mitoxantrone and prednisone (M + P) or to prednisone alone (P) and showed better palliation with M + P. There was no significant difference in survival. A detailed retrospective chart review was performed of resources used from randomization until death of 114 of 161 patients enrolled at the three largest centers: these included hospital admissions, outpatient visits, investigations, therapies (which included all chemotherapy and radiation), and palliative care. Cancer center and community hospital costs were calculated by using the hotel approximation method and case costing from the Ontario Case Cost Project, respectively. Cost-utility analysis was performed by transforming the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 global quality-of-life item measured every 3 weeks on trial to an estimate of utility, and extending the last known value through to death or last follow-up. RESULTS: The mean total cost until death or last follow-up by intention-to-treat was M + P CDN $27,300; P CDN $29,000. The 95% confidence intervals on the observed cost difference ranged from a saving of $9,200 for M + P (with palliative benefit) to an increased cost of $5,800 for M + P. The major proportion of cost (M + P 53% v P 66%; CDN $14,500 v $19,100) was for inpatient care. Initial M + P was consistently less expensive in whichever time period was used to compare costs. Cost-utility analysis showed M + P to be the preferred strategy with an upper 95% confidence interval for the incremental cost-utility ratio of CDN $19,700 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). CONCLUSION: A treatment that reduces symptoms and improves quality of life has the potential to reduce costs in other areas.

740,Cost-effectiveness of routine radiation therapy following conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer,"PURPOSE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of radiation therapy following conservative surgery for early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: Using a Markov model, a cost-utility analysis was performed to compare a strategy of radiation therapy versus no radiation therapy in a hypothetical cohort of 60-year-old women following conservative surgery. Local recurrence, distant recurrence, and survival rates used in the model were derived from randomized trial data. Utilities for the nonmetastatic health states were collected from actual patients. Direct medical costs were estimated using data from a single institution. Transportation and time costs were also estimated. Years of life, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), costs, and incremental cost/QALY over a 10-year time horizon were calculated by the model for each strategy. RESULTS: The addition of radiation therapy results in a cost increase of $9,800 per patient, no change in life expectancy, and an increase of 0.35 QALYs per patient, which leads to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28,000/QALY, which is well below $50,000/QALY, a commonly cited threshold for cost-effective care. Sensitivity analysis shows the ratio to be heavily influenced by the cost of radiation therapy and the quality-of-life benefit that results from decreased risk of local recurrence. CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy following conservative surgery is cost-effective compared with other accepted medical interventions.

741,Computer simulation to estimate the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the benefit of carotid endarterectomy relative to medical treatment, by comparing the outcome for different groups of patients following transient ischaemic attacks. METHODS: A Markov model was used to describe the survival and quality of life of patients treated for a transient ischaemic attack. The benefit is measured in terms of quality adjusted life months (QALMs). The outcome was estimated using a computer simulation with parameters based on published studies on the probability of events following treatment. The benefit of carotid endarterectomy was explored using a baseline set of parameters and a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: The baseline scenario of a 65-year-old male patient with the model factors set at an intermediate level showed a benefit for surgery of 3 QALMs compared with medical treatment alone. The sensitivity analysis showed that the most favourable combination of factors had a benefit of 13.4 QALMs and the least favourable a loss of 2 QALMs. Of all 128 factor combinations, 79.9% showed a benefit for surgery, 5.5% showed equal benefit, and 15.6% showed a benefit for medical treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Computer simulations have the potential for deriving estimates of benefit for different patient groups from the results of clinical trials. Combined with reliable information on costs, the technique could also demonstrate variations in cost-effectiveness for these groups.

For patients following a transient ischaemic attack, the results from this simulation and limited cost information suggest that carotid endarterectomy is unlikely to be a cost-effective intervention in the UK for many patient groups despite a reduction in the risk of stroke.",1998-01-01993,10180392,J Health Serv Res Policy,M Lavender,1998,3 / 1,6-11,No,10180392,"M Lavender; N Craig; R Kerr; D Howel; Computer simulation to estimate the effectiveness of carotid endarterectomy, J Health Serv Res Policy, 1998-Jan; 3(1):1355-8196; 6-11",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Carotid endarterectomy vs. Medical treatment,Not Stated,85 Years,85 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,6.00,89860,United Kingdom,1992,292790.78
745,ALS/MND and the perspective of health economics,"In health care, choices are constantly being made about alternative uses of scarce resources, and health economics offers a framework for analysing these choices and for improving resource allocation. In cost-effectiveness analysis, the costs and consequences of alternatives are systematically measured and compared, with the objective of achieving maximum health gain with the available resources. Treatment options for patients with ALS/MND are severely limited, but riluzole has been shown to offer modest improvements in survival. However, decision-makers are likely to want convincing evidence on the cost-effectiveness of this therapy before recommending widespread adoption. Here, some initial estimates of cost-effectiveness are provided, using published effectiveness data and considering only the costs of therapy and of tracheostomy. Compared with placebo, the incremental cost per life year gained of 50 mg/day of riluzole is pound sterling 45630, and of 100 mg/day is pound sterling 44890. Increasing the estimated costs of tracheostomy reduces the cost per life year gained of 50 mg/day to pound sterling 34940. However, if quality of life during the increased period of survival is 80% of full health, the cost per quality adjusted life year gained of 50 mg/day becomes pound sterling 57040. These cost-effectiveness ratios are well in excess of the range that is normally considered to be acceptable in UK health technology assessment. However, the comparatively small number of ALS/MND patients and the lack of treatment alternatives should also be considered. Meanwhile, better information on costs is required in order to produce more precise estimates of cost-effectiveness.",1998-01-01994,9851642,J Neurol Sci,A M Gray,1998,160 Suppl 1 /,S2-5,No,9851642,"A M Gray; ALS/MND and the perspective of health economics, J Neurol Sci, 1998-Oct; 160 Suppl 1():0022-510X; S2-5",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Riluzole 50 mg/day vs. Placebo,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,18 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,57040,United Kingdom,1997,150627.56
746,A cost-effectiveness analysis on different surgical strategies for intracranial aneurysms,"BACKGROUND: Economical studies on surgery of intracranial aneurysms have considered only the significant benefit of surgical approach on unruptured aneurysms and no studies have been performed comparing cost/benefit analysis of early vs delayed surgery. The present study was retrospectively performed in order to verify whether different treatment options in aneurysm surgery have a different cost/benefit ratio. METHODS: We have analysed a series of 137 patients which underwent surgery for intracranial aneurysms (21 unruptured aneurysms, 56 early surgery and 60 delayed surgery). In the analysis we assumed that each state of an operated patient has an assigned quality of life value and an associated medical cost. We expressed the outcome of each patient as the expected length of survival adjusted for quality, and referred to it as ""quality-adjusted life years"" (QALY). We considered for each patient the direct cost of Hospitalisation (obtained from DRG reimbursement), the Rehabilitation cost and the correction due to QALY adjusted for age and deficit. RESULTS: Significantly higher costs are reported in patients which present as major complication the hydrocephalus and which are treated with nimodipine; moreover, the costs for patients operated for unruptured aneurysms is significantly lower than that of patients which presented with SAH. Meanwhile, the average QALY adjusted for post-operative neurological deficit at three months follow-up is higher in patients operated for unruptured aneurysms than in patients operated after SAH. The cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies did not significantly differ considering age and neurological deficit adjustment; thus, after SAH, the choice of early or delayed surgery may depend on clinical and logistic conditions related to the neurosurgical department and its organisation, because there is no significant economical advantage leading to recommend early versus delayed surgery.

Which screening strategy is most appropriate is still unclear. This study assessed the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening for asymptomatic carotid stenosis. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed with a Markov model and with data from ACAS and other studies. RESULTS: For 60-year-old patients with a 5% prevalence of 60% to 99% asymptomatic stenosis, duplex ultrasound screening increased average quality-adjusted life years (QALY; 11.485 vs 11.473) and lifetime cost of care ($5500 vs $5012) under base-case assumptions. The incremental cost per QALY gained (cost-effectiveness ratio) was $39,495. Screening was cost-effective with the following conditions: disease prevalence was 4.5% or more, the specificity of the screening test (ultrasound) was 91% or more, the stroke rate of patients who were medically treated was 3.3% or more, the relative risk reduction of surgery was 37% or more, the stroke rate associated with surgery was 160% or less than that of the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial or ACAS perioperative complication rates, and the cost of ultrasound screening was $300 or less. A one-time screening, compared with a screening every 5 years, had more QALY (11.485 vs 11.482) and lower cost ($5500 vs $5790).

Data were obtained from clinical trials, epidemiologic studies, and population surveys, and a single-payer perspective was assumed. Costs and benefits are discounted at 3% and costs are expressed in 1995 US dollars. SETTING: Single-payer health care system. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of 10000 persons with newly diagnosed diabetes from the general US population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost per additional life-year gained and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The incremental cost of opportunistic screening among all persons aged 25 years or older is estimated at $236449 per life-year gained and $56649 per QALY gained. Screening is more cost-effective among younger people and among African Americans. The benefits of early detection and treatment accrue more from postponement of complications and the resulting improvement in quality of life than from additional life-years. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and treatment through opportunistic screening of type 2 diabetes may reduce the lifetime incidence of major microvascular complications and result in gains in both life-years and QALYs. Incremental increases in costs attributable to screening and earlier treatment are incurred but may well be in the range of acceptable cost-effectiveness for US health care systems, especially for younger adults and for some subpopulations (eg, minorities) who are at relatively high risk of developing the major complications of type 2 diabetes.

However, because of differences in incidence rates as well as drug efficacy, toxicity, and costs, the role of different types of prophylaxis remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of strategies for preventing opportunistic infections in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. DESIGN: We developed a Markov simulation model to compare different strategies for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), toxoplasmosis, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, fungal infections, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in HIV-infected patients. Data for the model were derived from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, randomized controlled trials, and the national AIDS Cost and Services Utilization Survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Projected life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, total lifetime direct medical costs, and cost-effectiveness in dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. RESULTS: For patients with CD4 cell counts of 0.200 to 0.300 x 10(9)/L (200-300/microL) who receive no prophylaxis, we projected a quality-adjusted life expectancy of 39.08 months and average total lifetime costs of $40288. Prophylaxis for PCP and toxoplasmosis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for patients with CD4 cell counts of 0.200 x 10(9)/L (200/microL) or less increased quality-adjusted life expectancy to 42.56 months, implying an incremental cost of $16000 per QALY saved. Prophylaxis for MAC for patients with CD4 cell counts of 0.050 x 10(9)/L (50/microL) or less produced smaller gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy; incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were $35000 per QALY saved for azithromycin and $74000 per QALY saved for rifabutin. Oral ganciclovir for the prevention of CMV infection was the least cost-effective prophylaxis ($314000 per QALY saved). Results were most sensitive to the risk of developing an opportunistic infection, the impact of opportunistic infection history on long-term survival, and the cost of prophylaxis.

However, because of differences in incidence rates as well as drug efficacy, toxicity, and costs, the role of different types of prophylaxis remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical impact, cost, and cost-effectiveness of strategies for preventing opportunistic infections in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. DESIGN: We developed a Markov simulation model to compare different strategies for prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), toxoplasmosis, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection, fungal infections, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease in HIV-infected patients.

769,A Monte Carlo simulation of advanced HIV disease: application to prevention of CMV infection,"BACKGROUND: Disagreement exists among decision makers regarding the allocation of limited HIV patient care resources and, specifically, the comparative value of preventing opportunistic infections in late-stage disease. METHODS: A Monte Carlo simulation framework was used to evaluate a state-transition model of the natural history of HIV illness in patients with CD4 counts below 300/mm3 and to project the costs and consequences of alternative strategies for preventing AIDS-related complications. The authors describe the model and demonstrate how it may be employed to assess the cost-effectiveness of oral ganciclovir for prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. RESULTS: Ganciclovir prophylaxis confers an estimated additional 0.7 quality-adjusted month of life at a net cost of $10,700, implying an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of roughly $173,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Sensitivity analysis reveals that this baseline result is stable over a wide range of input data estimates, including quality of life and drug efficacy, but it is sensitive to CMV incidence and drug price assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: The Monte Carlo simulation framework offers decision makers a powerful and flexible tool for evaluating choices in the realm of chronic disease patient care. The authors have used it to assess HIV-related treatment options and continue to refine it to reflect advances in defining the pathogenesis and treatment of AIDS. Compared with alternative interventions, CMV prophylaxis does not appear to be a cost-effective use of scarce HIV clinical care funds.

770,Decision and cost-utility analyses of surgical versus transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus: should you let a smile be your umbrella?,"Decision and cost-utility analyses considered the tradeoffs of treating patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) using conventional surgery versus transcatheter implantation of the Rashkind occluder. Physicians and informed lay parents assigned utility scores to procedure success/complications combinations seen in prognostically similar pediatric patients with isolated PDA treated from 1982 to 1987. Utility scores multiplied by outcome frequencies from a comparative study generated expected utility values for the two approaches. Cost-utility analyses combined these results with simulated provider cost estimates from 1989. On a 0-100 scale (worst to best observed outcome), the median expected utility for surgery was 99.96, versus 98.88 for the occluder. Results of most sensitivity analyses also slightly favored surgery. Expected utility differences based on 1987 data were minimal. With a mean overall simulated cost of $8,838 vs $12,466 for the occluder, surgery was favored in most cost-utility analyses. Use of the inherently less invasive but less successful, more risky, and more costly occluder approach conferred no apparent net advantage in this study.

771,Cost-effectiveness of tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke. NINDS rt-PA Stroke Study Group,"Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been shown to improve 3-month outcome in stroke patients treated within 3 hours of symptom onset. The costs associated with this new treatment will be a factor in determining the extent of its utilization. Data from the NINDS rt-PA Stroke Trial and the medical literature were used to estimate the health and economic outcomes associated with using tPA in acute stroke patients. A Markov model was developed to estimate the costs per 1,000 patients eligible for treatment with tPA compared with the costs per 1,000 untreated patients. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses (using Monte Carlo simulation) were performed to estimate the overall uncertainty of the model results. In the NINDS rt-PA Stroke Trial, the average length of stay was significantly shorter in tPA-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients (10.9 versus 12.4 days; p = 0.02) and more tPA patients were discharged to home than to inpatient rehabilitation or a nursing home (48% versus 36%; p = 0.002). The Markov model estimated an increase in hospitalization costs of $1.7 million and a decrease in rehabilitation costs of $1.4 million and nursing home cost of $4.8 million per 1,000 eligible treated patients for a health care system that includes acute through long-term care facilities. Multiway sensitivity analysis revealed a greater than 90% probability of cost savings. The estimated impact on long-term health outcomes was 564 (3 to 850) quality-adjusted life-years saved over 30 years of the model per 1,000 patients.

772,"Cost-effectiveness of new treatments for overactive bladder: the example of tolterodine, a new muscarinic agent: a Markov model","Economic analyses of interventions for chronic diseases require evaluations over a long timeframe to illustrate the benefits and costs of treatments. Clinical trials are generally short and carried out in strictly controlled conditions. They are therefore of limited value for economic evaluation aimed at facilitating decisions about resource allocation. The objective of this study was to develop a simulation model that allows integration of data from different sources to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of new treatments for overactive bladder. The model compares tolterodine, a new treatment that aims at alleviating symptoms and improving patients' quality of life, to no treatment. Simulations for Sweden are presented as an example. The Markov model combines clinical, observational, and economic data. Markov states are defined based on severity of symptoms of overactive bladder (frequency of voids and leaks). Specific costs for drug treatment and use of sanitary protections as well as utilities are assigned for each state. The effectiveness of tolterodine is based on controlled clinical trials and open long-term extensions of these trials. Outcome is measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and as the number of months spent in a state with no or very limited symptoms. During the course of 1 year, patients treated with tolterodine spend more time in states with no or limited symptoms compared to those receiving no treatment. Tolterodine-treated patients having a better quality of life during the year. The mean utility of the treated cohort is 0.70, compared to 0.67 in the no-treatment cohort, which is equivalent to the entire cohort moving by one level to a state with less severe symptoms. Mean total costs per patient in the tolterodine arm are SEK8,595 (US $1,131; 1 US$ = 7.6 SEK) compared to SEK3,286 (US$432) in the no-treatment arm. The extra cost due to tolterodine is SEK380 (US$50) per month, which falls within the range of monthly amounts that patients were willing to pay out of pocket for a 25 or 50% improvement of their symptoms in a previous study. The cost for pads is reduced by 23%. The marginal cost per QALY gained with tolterodine is estimated at SEK213,000 (US$28,000).

A decision-analytical model,"OBJECTIVE: The value of early detection of subclinical hypothyroidism is the object of a long lasting debate. In this study, we assessed the cost effectiveness of a policy based upon screening for this condition through thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) serum level measurements in the elderly. DESIGN: A Markov model was developed where hypothetical elderly patients (i.e. > or = 60 years of age), who attend general practitioner (GP) clinics for periodic health examinations in a primary-care setting in Italy, made transitions between health states at annual interval for 15 years, thus allowing an estimation of the average cost and of the expected average number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). In this model, patients were assumed to be seen at annual intervals by GPs for clinical examination and serum cholesterol level measurement, to which a TSH, T3 and T4 serum measurement was added. In the base-case analysis, TSH was measured every 5 years and, if abnormal, T3 and T4 serum levels were also determined. Costs were analysed from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS) and reflected 1996 values. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, the additional benefit estimated from testing a female population for subclinical hypothyroidism every 5 years was 0.36 QALY, with a cost per QALY gained of 668,298 lire (L). The expected gain in QALY for men was 0.20 and the cost per QALY gained was L270,322. In general, the best cost-effectiveness profile was seen with testing every 3 years. Results were sensitive to variations in the prevalence of disease among the target population, both in men and women.

775,Cost effectiveness of pramipexole in Parkinson's disease in the US,"OBJECTIVE: Pramipexole was recently approved in the US for treatment of the symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Although pramipexole has been found to be safe and efficacious when compared with placebo, little data are yet available on its cost effectiveness when compared with baseline treatment. The aim of this study was to estimate the costs and cost effectiveness (cost utility) of pramipexole compared with baseline treatment in patients with early and advanced PD. DESIGN AND SETTING: We developed a cost-effectiveness (CE) model in the US setting that linked Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II (activities of daily life) and III (motor) scores to disease progression, costs and patient utility. Data for the model were obtained from clinical trials, a literature review and a survey of 193 patients' health resource use and utility. We used cost and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimates from the model to estimate the incremental cost effectiveness of pramipexole relative to baseline treatment patterns. We performed separate analyses for patients with early and advanced PD. We also performed extensive sensitivity analyses by adding other dopamine agonists to the no-pramipexole treatment regimen and varying disease progression parameters. The study was conducted from the societal perspective, although data presentation allows interpretation of cost effectiveness from either the societal or payer perspective. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: For patients with both early and advanced PD, treatment with pramipexole had higher costs but was more effective than baseline treatment. For patients with early onset of PD, the incremental total CE ratio for pramipexole was $US8837/QALY. For patients with advanced PD, the incremental CE ratio was $US12 294/QALY (1997 costs).

777,Endoscopic versus open carpal tunnel release: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"Endoscopic carpal tunnel release is a controversial procedure used in the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. Although endoscopic carpal tunnel release is associated with less incisional pain and faster recovery time than the open carpal tunnel release, opponents of endoscopic carpal tunnel release suggest that its benefits are outweighed by its higher complication rates from median nerve transection and transient numbness of the fingers. Because of the huge economic and social impact of carpal tunnel syndrome in this country, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release using guidelines established by the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine of the U.S. Public Health Service. A decision analytic model was used to measure differences in cost and effectiveness--expressed as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)--between endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release. The societal perspective was chosen, and probabilities for various outcomes for the two procedures were obtained from published randomized-controlled trials. Cost data were derived from the Medicare Resource-Based Relative Value Units published in the Federal Register. QALYs were obtained from two groups of health care providers using a utility-assessment questionnaire. Using probabilities for various outcomes from the two published randomized-controlled trials comparing endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release, we constructed a decision tree to derive both the cost and the QALYs for the two procedures. The incremental cost difference between endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release was $46, using Medicare cost and probabilities of various outcomes derived from a study by Brown et al. in 1993.

The societal perspective was chosen, and probabilities for various outcomes for the two procedures were obtained from published randomized-controlled trials. Cost data were derived from the Medicare Resource-Based Relative Value Units published in the Federal Register. QALYs were obtained from two groups of health care providers using a utility-assessment questionnaire. Using probabilities for various outcomes from the two published randomized-controlled trials comparing endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release, we constructed a decision tree to derive both the cost and the QALYs for the two procedures. The incremental cost difference between endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release was $46, using Medicare cost and probabilities of various outcomes derived from a study by Brown et al. in 1993. We calculated QALYs for five age groups--25, 35, 45, 55, 65--assuming a life expectancy of 75 years. The marginal effectiveness (QALY of endoscopic carpal tunnel release minus QALY of open carpal tunnel release) ranged from 0.235 QALY for the 25-year-old age group to 0.066 QALY for the 65-year-old age group, giving a cost-effectiveness ratio of $195/QALY and $693/QALY, respectively. When compared with other accepted medical interventions such as breast cancer screening ($4836/QALY) and exercise to prevent coronary heart disease ($13,508/QALY), endoscopic carpal tunnel release seems to be cost-effective. However, our sensitivity analysis indicated that the cost-effectiveness ratio was very sensitive to a major complication such as median nerve injury. For endoscopic carpal tunnel release to be a cost-effective procedure, the incidence of median nerve injury must be one percentage point less for endoscopic carpal tunnel release than for open carpal tunnel release. Based on the data from the randomized-controlled trials, endoscopic carpal tunnel release seems to be a cost-effective procedure; however, before it can be recommended, greater emphasis must be given to the training of surgeons in this new technique, so that major complications such as median nerve injuries can be avoided. In addition, future studies must better define the actual incidence of nerve injuries for both endoscopic carpal tunnel release and open carpal tunnel release in the community setting.",1998-01-02005,9734428,Plast Reconstr Surg,K C Chung,1998,102 / 4,1089-99,No,9734428,"K C Chung; M R Walters; M L Greenfield; M E Chernew; Endoscopic versus open carpal tunnel release: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Plast Reconstr Surg, 1998-Sep; 102(4):0032-1052; 1089-99",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endoscopic carpal tunnel release vs. Open carpal tunnel release,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,693,United States,1997,1117.48
787,Iliac arterial occlusive disease: cost-effectiveness analysis of stent placement versus percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Dutch Iliac Stent Trial Study Group,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the relative benefits and cost-effectiveness of treating iliac arterial occlusive disease with various interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cost-effectiveness was analyzed in a hypothetical cohort of patients with intermittent claudication caused by an iliac arterial stenosis. Primary stent placement, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), and PTA with selective stent placement were analyzed. Reduction in the risk of failure after primary stent placement versus that after PTA with selective stent placement, quality of life, and cost data were derived from results of a randomized, controlled trail. Complication rates, patency results, and the reduction in risk of failure were derived from a published meta-analysis. RESULTS: PTA with selective stent placement yielded equivalent complication rates, patency results, and quality-of-life outcomes compared with those of primary stent placement, and the latter cost +957 less (95% confidence interval = +726, +1,188). PTA with selective stent placement was more expensive than PTA alone but yielded higher patency results (relative risk of long-term failure, 0.61; 95% confidence interval = 0.49, 0.75) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (0.2 quality-adjusted life year [QALY] gained) and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of less than +20,000 per QALY gained.

793,Cost-effectiveness of preference-based antithrombotic therapy for patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent atrial fibrillation guidelines recommend the incorporation of patient preferences into the selection of antithrombotic therapy. However, no trial has examined how incorporating such preferences would affect quality-adjusted survival or medical expenditure. We compared 10-year projections of quality-adjusted survival and medical expenditure associated with two atrial fibrillation treatment strategies: warfarin-for-all therapy versus preference-based therapy. The preference-based strategy prescribed whichever antithrombotic therapy, warfarin or aspirin, had the greater projected quality-adjusted survival. METHODS: We used decision analysis stratified by the number of stroke risk factors (history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease). The base case focused on compliant 65-year-old patients who had nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and no contraindications to antithrombotic therapy. RESULTS: In patients whose only risk factor for stroke was atrial fibrillation, preference-based therapy improved projected quality-adjusted survival by 0.05 quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and saved $670. For patients who had atrial fibrillation and one additional risk factor for stroke, preference-based therapy improved quality-adjusted survival by 0.02 QALY and saved $90. In patients who had atrial fibrillation and multiple additional risk factors for stroke, preference-based therapy increased medical expenditures and did not improve quality-adjusted survival substantially. The benefits of preference-flexible therapy arose from the minority of patients who would have had a longer quality-adjusted survival if they had been prescribed aspirin rather than warfarin.

796,Is routine duplex ultrasound surveillance after carotid endarterectomy cost-effective?,"BACKGROUND: Although duplex ultrasound surveillance of patients after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is routinely performed, the use of this policy has been questioned. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. METHODS: Using a decision-analytic Markov model that depicts the natural history of patients after CEA, we compared a strategy of duplex ultrasound surveillance to a strategy of no surveillance. Probability estimates were derived from the literature and costs were obtained from the hospital's cost accounting system. Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness and stability of our base-case conclusion to variations in the underlying assumptions. RESULTS: Using baseline estimates we determined that duplex ultrasound surveillance after CEA reduced the incidence of stroke; however, this required significant additional expense, which resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $126,950. This ratio could decrease to a more acceptable level (less than $100,000) if a subset of patients could be identified whose rate of progression to greater than 80% stenosis exceeded 6% per year or whose stroke rate associated with uncorrected asymptomatic stenosis exceeded 2.6% per year. Also, the cost-effectiveness ratio was reduced to less than $100,000 if patients were younger than 55 years old at the time of initial CEA or if the cost of CEA could be reduced to less than $7,000. CONCLUSIONS: Duplex ultrasound surveillance after CEA is associated with an unfavorable cost-effectiveness ratio.

797,Cost-utility model comparing docetaxel and paclitaxel in advanced breast cancer patients,"Relevant data from direct comparisons in clinical trials are not available for economic evaluations of docetaxel and paclitaxel in the management of metastatic breast cancer. A modified Markov model is used to estimate the incremental cost in US$ per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for docetaxel versus paclitaxel in managing metastatic breast cancer patients in the US. The model incorporates the latest available clinical trial data (response rates of 47.8% for docetaxel and 25% for paclitaxel, chemotherapy-specific toxicities, time to progression, and 1-year survival) from studies against other comparators. Medical care resources were estimated by US oncologists and costed using US data sources. Utility scores were obtained from 29 US oncology nurses. The base case and subsequent sensitivity analyses show that docetaxel management of advanced breast cancer is more costly per patient but yields higher health benefits than paclitaxel therapy. The cost per QALY gained by docetaxel is $8615, and ranges between $3943 and $9416 in sensitivity analyses.

798,The costs and cost-effectiveness of unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia,"Unrelated donor transplantation prolongs survival in some patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. However, there are growing concerns about the intensive resources required for this procedure given health care budget constraints. To address this issue, we conducted a study of the costs and cost-effectiveness of unrelated donor transplantation for chronic phase CML. The costs of transplantation were derived from 157 patients from the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Estimates of the effectiveness of transplantation were taken from our previous work using data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry and the National Marrow Donor Program. The median cost of the first 6 months of care including donor identification, marrow collection, patient hospitalization for transplantation and all outpatient medications and readmissions through 6 months postmarrow infusion was $178,500 (range, $85,000 to $462,400) and the mean was $196,200. Mean costs for patients surviving beyond 6 months posttransplant were significantly lower than for patients dying within that period ($189,700 v $211,000, respectively, P =.03). Posttransplant follow-up costs were high for months 6 to 18, then decreased.

799,The costs and cost-effectiveness of unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia,"Unrelated donor transplantation prolongs survival in some patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in chronic phase. However, there are growing concerns about the intensive resources required for this procedure given health care budget constraints. To address this issue, we conducted a study of the costs and cost-effectiveness of unrelated donor transplantation for chronic phase CML. The costs of transplantation were derived from 157 patients from the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Estimates of the effectiveness of transplantation were taken from our previous work using data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry and the National Marrow Donor Program. The median cost of the first 6 months of care including donor identification, marrow collection, patient hospitalization for transplantation and all outpatient medications and readmissions through 6 months postmarrow infusion was $178,500 (range, $85,000 to $462,400) and the mean was $196,200. Mean costs for patients surviving beyond 6 months posttransplant were significantly lower than for patients dying within that period ($189,700 v $211,000, respectively, P =.03). Posttransplant follow-up costs were high for months 6 to 18, then decreased. The incremental cost-effectiveness of transplantation within 1 year of diagnosis versus -interferon therapy without transplant in the base case of a 35-year-old patient was $51,800/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.

800,Cost-effectiveness of recombinant human erythropoietin in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced anaemia,"Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) has been advocated for the treatment of anaemia in patients submitted to cancer chemotherapy. We used decision analysis to compare the cost-effectiveness of rHuEPO supplemented with red blood cell (RBC) transfusions with conventional treatment with RBC transfusions alone. At baseline, we analysed the use of rHuEPO as secondary prophylaxis according to effectiveness estimates from a community-based oncology study. In order to reduce the probability of transfusions from 21.9% to 10.4%, and the number of RBC units per patient per month from 0.55 to 0.29, 150 units kg(-1) s.c. rHuEPO three times per week for 4 months resulted in an incremental cost of $189,652 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). In patients treated with cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, rHuEPO added $190,142 per QALY. In a hypothetical scenario of a transfusion pattern that maintained the same haemoglobin level of rHuEPO-responsive patients, the marginal cost of rHuEPO was always greater than $100,000 per QALY. Results were stable with regard to variations in the probability of blood-borne infections, quality of life of responding patients and cancer-related mortality. The additional cost could be lowered to less than $100,000 per QALY by saving 4.5 RBC units over 4 months for any patient treated. In conclusion, according to current use, rHuEPO is not cost-effective in the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anaemia. More tailored utilization of the drug and better consideration of predictive response indicators may lead to an effective, blood-sparing alternative.",1998-01-02012,9743301,Br J Cancer,G Barosi,1998,78 / 6,781-7,No,9743301,"G Barosi; M Marchetti; N L Liberato; Cost-effectiveness of recombinant human erythropoietin in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced anaemia, Br J Cancer, 1998-Sep; 78(6):0007-0920; 781-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Prophylactic recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO) vs. Red blood cell transfusions alone,Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,3.00,189652,United States,1996,312836.35
