22801,Cost-effectiveness of direct anti-viral agents for hepatitis C virus infection and a combined intervention of syringe access and medication assisted therapy for opioid use disorders in an injection drug use population,"BACKGROUND: There are too many plausible permutations and scale-up scenarios of combination hepatitis C (HCV) interventions for exhaustive testing in experimental trials. Therefore, we used computer simulation to project the health and economic impact of alternative combination intervention scenarios for people who inject drugs (PWID), focusing on direct anti-viral agents (DAA) and medication-assisted treatment combined with syringe access programs (MAT+). METHODS: We performed an allocative efficiency study using a mathematical model simulating the progression of HCV in PWID and its related consequences. Two previously validated simulations were combined to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intervention strategies that included a range of coverage levels. Analyses were performed from a health sector and societal perspective with a 15-year time horizon and a discount rate of 3%. RESULTS: From a health-sector perspective (excluding criminal justice system-related costs), four potential strategies fell on the cost-efficiency frontier. DAA at 20% coverage had an ICER of $27,251/QALY. Combinations of DAA 20% with MAT+ at 20%, 40%, and 80% coverage had ICERs of $165,985/QALY, $325,860/QALY, and $399,189/QALY, respectively. When analyzed from a societal perspective (including criminal justice system-related costs), DAA 20% with MAT+ 80% was most effective and was cost saving. While DAA 20% with MAT+ 80% was more expensive (e.g., less cost-saving) than MAT+ 80% alone without DAA, it offered favorable value compared to MAT+ 80% alone ($23,932/QALY).

22809,Cost-effectiveness of abiraterone versus docetaxel in the treatment of metastatic hormone naive prostate cancer,"PURPOSE: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the US. Since 2015, landmark studies have demonstrated improved survival outcomes with the use of docetaxel (DCT) or abiraterone (AA) in addition to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) in the metastatic hormone-naive setting. These treatment strategies have not been prospectively compared but have similar overall survival benefits despite differing mechanisms of action, toxicity, and cost. We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis to provide insight into the value of AA vs. DCT in the first-line treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed Markov models by using a US-payer perspective and a 3-year time horizon to estimate costs (2018 US$) and progression-free quality-adjusted life years (PF-QALYs) for ADT alone, DCT, and AA. Health states were defined as initial state, treatment states according to experience of an adverse event, and progressed disease/death. State transition probabilities were derived from rates for drug discontinuation, frequency of adverse events, disease progression, and death from the randomized phase III trials ChemoHormonal Therapy Versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer (CHAARTED) and LATITUDE. Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate model uncertainty. RESULTS: DCT resulted in an increase of 0.32 PF-QALYs and $16,100 in cost and AA resulted in an increase of 0.52 PF-QALYs and $215,800 in cost compared to ADT alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for DCT vs. ADT was $50,500/PF-QALY and for AA vs. DCT was $1,010,000/PF-QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/PF-QALY AA was highly unlikely to be cost-effective.

22811,Cost-effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery for People with Morbid Obesity in South Korea,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of bariatric surgery (BS) compared to non-surgical treatment (NST) in Korean people with morbid obesity according to comorbidities and body mass index (BMI) severity. METHODS: The target cohort was people with morbid obesity, defined as BMI of >/= 35 kg/m(2), or obese people with BMI of 30-34.9 kg/m(2) having obesity-related comorbidities. A decision-tree model for 1-year obesity treatment and Markov model for the rest of life were used. In the decision-tree model, the comorbidity remission rate and BMI change after 1-year treatment were decided based on a prospective clinical trial. In the Markov model, the transition probabilities were calculated considering the BMI level and age. The starting age of 20 years, a cycle length of 1 year, a time horizon of 80 years, and a 5% discount rate were applied for the base case from the healthcare system perspective. RESULTS: In the base case, BS improved quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and was the cost-effective option in total cohort (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of BS vs. NST was 674 USD/QALY). It was shown to be cost-effective in all subgroup analyses based on BMI level. In particular, BS was a dominant alternative for the subgroup with basal BMI of 35.0-37.4 kg/m(2). Various sensitivity analyses showed the robustness of results indicating the cost-effectiveness of BS. CONCLUSION: BS at BMI of > 30 kg/m(2) was more effective than NST for a reduction in BMI and remission of obesity-related comorbidities and was cost-effective in Korea.",2019-01-32204,31396789,Obes Surg,Sena An,2019,/,,No,31396789,"Sena An; Yuta Yokoya; Ataru Igarashi; Akihito Uda; Hisato Deguchi; Toshihisa Takeuchi; Kazuhide Higuchi; Cost-effectiveness of Bariatric Surgery for People with Morbid Obesity in South Korea, Obes Surg, 2019 Jun 18; ():0960-8923",QALY,South Korea,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Pharmaceutical, Surgical",bariatric surgery vs. Standard/Usual Care- non-surgical treatment + diet + exercise + medication,"BMI of = 35 kg/m2, or obese people with BMI of 30– 34.9 kg/m2 having obesity-related comorbidities.",100 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,80 Years,5.00,5.00,674,United States,2017,711.65

In the Markov model, the transition probabilities were calculated considering the BMI level and age. The starting age of 20 years, a cycle length of 1 year, a time horizon of 80 years, and a 5% discount rate were applied for the base case from the healthcare system perspective. RESULTS: In the base case, BS improved quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and was the cost-effective option in total cohort (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of BS vs. NST was 674 USD/QALY). It was shown to be cost-effective in all subgroup analyses based on BMI level. In particular, BS was a dominant alternative for the subgroup with basal BMI of 35.0-37.4 kg/m(2).

22817,Cost-utility analysis of a 'vonoprazan-first' strategy versus 'esomeprazole- or rabeprazole-first' strategy in GERD,"BACKGROUND: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can be treated using a vonoprazan-first strategy (first-line treatment with vonoprazan), or esomeprazole-first/rabeprazole-first strategies (first-line treatment with proton-pump inhibitors [PPIs], esomeprazole/rabeprazole, followed by a switch to vonoprazan). This cost-utility analysis used long-term simulation modeling to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a vonoprazan-first strategy compared with the esomeprazole-first and rabeprazole-first strategies. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vonoprazan-first, esomeprazole-first, and rabeprazole-first strategies, comprising healing and maintenance therapies, over 5 years (4-week cycles). Healing therapy began with the administration of a normal dose of drug per real-world practice. If patients were not healed endoscopically, either a longer duration of healing therapy was provided (vonoprazan), the dose was increased (rabeprazole), or patients were switched to vonoprazan (immediately for esomeprazole, and after dose-escalation for rabeprazole, respectively). Healed patients received maintenance (lower/same dose as healing therapy). Recurrence resulted in re-challenge with healing therapy. Transition probabilities were derived from the results of indirect comparisons (network meta-analysis) and costs calculated from the Japanese payer perspective. Outcomes were defined as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), with utilities based on published values. RESULTS: Expected costs of the vonoprazan-, esomeprazole-, and rabeprazole-first strategies were yen36,194, yen76,719, and yen41,105, respectively, over 5 years. QALY gains for vonoprazan-first strategy versus the esomeprazole- and rabeprazole-first strategies were 0.014 and 0.003, respectively.

22819,An economic evaluation of a computer-tailored e-learning program to promote smoking cessation counseling guideline adherence among practice nurses,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct an economic evaluation of a tailored e-learning program, which successfully improved practice nurses'' smoking cessation guideline adherence. METHODS: The economic evaluation was embedded in a randomized controlled trial, in which 269 practice nurses recruited 388 smoking patients. Cost-effectiveness was assessed using guideline adherence as effect measure on practice nurse level, and continued smoking abstinence on patient level. Cost-utility was assessed on patient level, using patients'' Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) as effect measure. RESULTS: The e-learning program was likely to be cost-effective on practice nurse level, as adherence to an additional guideline step cost euro1,586. On patient level, cost-effectiveness was slightly likely after six months (cost per additional quitter: euro7,126), but not after twelve months. The cost-utility analysis revealed slight cost-effectiveness (cost per QALY gained: euro18,431) on patient level. CONCLUSION: Providing practice nurses with a tailored e-learning program is cost-effective to improve their smoking cessation counseling. Though, cost-effectiveness on patient level was not found after twelve months, potentially resulting from smoking relapse. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Widespread implementation of the e-learning program can improve the quality of smoking cessation care in general practice.

An analysis of the public health and economic impact of improvement in the UK,"OBJECTIVES: Early treatment of HIV-1 infection at all CD4 levels has demonstrated clinical and public health benefits. This analysis examined the costs, health outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of increased HIV-1 screening and early treatment initiation in the UK. METHODS: A Markov model followed theoretical cohorts of men who have sex with men (MSM), heterosexuals, and people who inject drugs (PWID) with initially undiagnosed HIV-1 infection over their remaining lifetimes. The analysis examined increased HIV-1 screening (resulting in 10-50% improvements in diagnosis rates) versus current screening in sexual health services (SHS) and other settings, with all individuals initiating treatment within 3 months of diagnosis. Health status was modelled by viral load and CD4 cell count as individuals progressed to diagnosis and treatment. Individuals accrued quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incurred costs for screening and HIV-related clinical management, and were at risk of transmitting HIV-1 infection to their partners. Input parameter data were taken primarily from UK-specific published sources. All outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: The model estimated that increased screening and early treatment resulted in fewer onward HIV transmissions, more QALYs, and higher total costs. For SHS, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for heterosexuals (~ pound22 000/QALY gained) were within typical UK willingness-to-pay thresholds and were well below these thresholds for MSM (~ pound9500/QALY gained) and PWID (~ pound6500/QALY gained).

The analysis examined increased HIV-1 screening (resulting in 10-50% improvements in diagnosis rates) versus current screening in sexual health services (SHS) and other settings, with all individuals initiating treatment within 3 months of diagnosis. Health status was modelled by viral load and CD4 cell count as individuals progressed to diagnosis and treatment. Individuals accrued quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incurred costs for screening and HIV-related clinical management, and were at risk of transmitting HIV-1 infection to their partners. Input parameter data were taken primarily from UK-specific published sources. All outcomes were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: The model estimated that increased screening and early treatment resulted in fewer onward HIV transmissions, more QALYs, and higher total costs. For SHS, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for heterosexuals (~ pound22 000/QALY gained) were within typical UK willingness-to-pay thresholds and were well below these thresholds for MSM (~ pound9500/QALY gained) and PWID (~ pound6500/QALY gained).

22829,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of a HMGA2 Prognostic Test for Acute Myeloid Leukemia in a Canadian Setting,"BACKGROUND: Current strategies for risk stratification of patients with acute myeloid leukemia assign approximately 40% of patients to the intermediate-risk group, where uncertainty about optimal therapy still persists. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of a HMGA2 prognostic test based on HMGA2(+)/HMGA2(-) expression, which improves genetic risk stratification in acute myeloid leukemia, and compare this test with the current standard of care in Canada. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed from the Canadian National Healthcare Service and societal perspective using data from the Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, published literature, and physician surveys. The model includes a lifetime horizon assessing the HMGA2 test vs. standard of care. RESULTS: The HMGA2 test outperformed the standard of care at all time horizons culminating with estimated improvements of 1.92 and 3.12 months in leukemia-free survival and overall survival, respectively. Costs associated with the HMGA2 test were consistently lower, except diagnostic costs, routine medical costs, and costs related to infections and false positives. From a societal perspective, total lifetime costs were $161,358 CAD and $151,908 CAD with the standard of care and the HMGA2 test, respectively. The incremental quality-adjusted life-year gain was 0.138, which led to dominance over the standard of care. Deterministic sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the base-case scenario. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed that for a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 CAD, the probability of cost effectiveness was 87.19%.

22830,Cost-effectiveness of coronary artery bypass grafting plus mitral valve repair versus coronary artery bypass grafting alone for moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation,"OBJECTIVE: The Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network reported that left ventricular reverse remodeling at 2 years did not differ between patients with moderate ischemic mitral regurgitation randomized to coronary artery bypass grafting plus mitral valve repair (n = 150) or coronary artery bypass grafting alone (n = 151). To address health resource use implications, we compared costs and quality-adjusted survival. METHODS: We used individual patient data from the Cardiothoracic Surgical Trials Network trial on survival, hospitalizations, quality of life, and US hospitalization costs to estimate cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life years. A microsimulation model was developed to extrapolate to 10 years. Bootstrap and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to address uncertainty. RESULTS: In-hospital costs were $59,745 for coronary artery bypass grafting plus mitral valve repair versus $51,326 for coronary artery bypass grafting alone (difference $8419; 95% uncertainty interval, 2259-18,757). Two-year costs were $81,263 versus $67,341 (difference 13,922 [2370 to 28,888]), and quality-adjusted life years were 1.35 versus 1.30 (difference 0.05; -0.04 to 0.14), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $308,343/quality-adjusted life year for coronary artery bypass grafting plus mitral valve repair. At 10 years, its costs remained higher ($107,733 vs $88,583, difference 19,150 [-3866 to 56,826]) and quality-adjusted life years showed no difference (-0.92 to 0.87), with 5.08 versus 5.08.

22834,Value Assessment and Quantitative Benefit-Risk Modelling of Biosimilar Infliximab for Crohn's Disease,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Regulatory approval of biosimilars often depends on extrapolating evidence from one clinical indication to all of those of the originator biologic. We aimed to develop a quantitative benefit-risk analysis to assess whether the resulting increase in the uncertainty in the clinical performance of biosimilars (i.e. risk) may be countered by their lower pricing (benefit). METHODS: A 1-year decision-analytic model was developed for the biosimilar infliximab (Inflectra((R))) for Crohn''s disease. The perspective was that of the National Health Service in the UK and costs were valued to 2015/16. A hypothetical cohort of biologic-naive patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn''s disease was simulated through the model. Immunogenicity to infliximab was a key modifier, influencing rates of non-response and infusion reactions. Net health benefit was estimated based on quality-adjusted life-years. A range of sensitivity analyses tested the robustness of the results and explored how the biosimilar price must respond to varying immunogenicity to remain the preferred option. RESULTS: The base-case analysis predicted a positive incremental net health benefit of 0.04 (95% central range 0.00-0.09) favouring the biosimilar, based on 0.803 quality-adjusted life-years, and costs of pound18,087 and pound19,176 for the biosimilar and originator, respectively. Two-way sensitivity analyses suggested that if 50% of patients developed antibodies, the value-based price of pound410 per vial must be lower than that of the originator ( pound420), but remain higher than the actual market price ( pound378).

22842,Analysis to determine cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic use in adult patients with suspected bacterial infection and sepsis,"PURPOSE: Results of a study incorporating real-world results into a predictive model to assess the cost-effectiveness of procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic use in intensive care unit patients with sepsis are reported. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted to determine whether reductions in antibiotic therapy duration and other care improvements resulting from PCT testing and use of an associated treatment pathway offset the costs of PCT testing. Selected base-case cost outcomes in adults with sepsis admitted to a medical intensive care unit (MICU) were assessed in preintervention and postintervention cohorts using a decision analytic model. Cost-minimization and cost-utility analyses were performed from the hospital perspective with a 1-year time horizon. Secondary and univariate sensitivity analyses tested a variety of clinically relevant scenarios and the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Base-case modeling predicted that use of a PCT-guided treatment algorithm would results in hospital cost savings of $45 per patient and result in a gain of 0.0001 quality-adjusted life-year. After exclusion of patients in the postintervention cohort for PCT test ordering outside of institutional guidelines, the mean inpatient antibiotic therapy duration was significantly reduced in the postintervention group relative to the preintervention group (6.2 days versus 4.9 days, p = 0.04) after adjustment for patient sex and age, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, study period, vasopressor use, and ventilator use. Total annual hospital cost savings of $4,840 were predicted.

The present study aims to investigate the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of using Enoxaparin compared to Heparin in VTE prophylaxis in medical inpatients, from Iranian payer''s perspective. METHODS: Decision tree modeling technique was used to evaluate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of the compared interventions. The main considered outcomes were Life Years Gained (LYG) for Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) for Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA). Costs and consequences of the interventions were evaluated for a three-month period and reported as Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICERs). One-way and Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA) were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the model due to uncertainty in the input data. RESULTS: In base case scenario (i.e. public tariff), incremental cost was $10.32, and incremental QALY and incremental LYG were 0.0001 and 0.0002 per patients respectively.

CONCLUSION: As the estimated ICER per QALY is more than three times the reported Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita by world bank for Iran in 2017 ($5415), the use of Enoxaparin for VTE prophylaxis in medical in patients doesn''t seem to be a cost-effective intervention compared to the use of Heparin in Iran.",2019-01-32255,31368091,Daru,Mohammadreza Amirsadri,2019,27 / 2,627-634,No,31368091,"Mohammadreza Amirsadri; Kibum Kim; Daniel R Touchette; Larisa H Cavallari; Amer K Ardati; Robert J DiDomenico; The cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis of the use of enoxaparin compared with heparin for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in medical inpatients in Iran, Daru, 2019 Dec; 27(2):1560-8115; 627-634",QALY,Iran,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,enoxaparin vs. Standard/Usual Care- Heparin,at risk for venous thromboembolism,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,3 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,55953.16,United States,2017,59078.38
22846,Cost-Effectiveness of Strategies to Personalize the Selection of P2Y12 Inhibitors in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome,"PURPOSE: Perform a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing strategies for selecting P2Y12 inhibitors in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). METHODS: Six strategies for selection of P2Y12 inhibitors in ACS were compared from the US healthcare system perspective: (1) clopidogrel for all (universal clopidogrel); (2) ticagrelor guided by platelet reactivity assay (PRA; clopidogrel + phenotype); (3) ticagrelor use only in CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (genotype + conservative ticagrelor); (4) ticagrelor use in both CYP2C19 intermediate and poor metabolizers (genotype + liberal ticagrelor); (5) ticagrelor use only in patients with CYP2C19 polymorphisms and clopidogrel nonresponse by PRA (genotype + phenotype); and (6) ticagrelor for all (universal ticagrelor). A decision model was developed to model major adverse cardiovascular events and bleeding during 1 year of treatment with a P2Y12 inhibitor. Model inputs were identified from the literature. Lifetime costs were adjusted to 2017 US dollars; quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were projected using a Markov model. The primary endpoint was the incremental cost-effectiveness compared to the next best option along the cost-effectiveness continuum. Sensitivity analyses were performed on all model inputs to assess their influence on the incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) for the clopidogrel + phenotype, genotype + liberal ticagrelor, and universal ticagrelor strategies were $12,119/QALY, $29,412/QALY, and $142,456/QALY, respectively.

22851,"In primary care, is measuring free-thyroxine plus thyroid-stimulating hormone to detect hypopituitarism cost-effective? A cost utility analysis using Markov chain models","OBJECTIVE: We examined whether it is cost-effective to measure free thyroxine (FT4) in addition to thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)) on all requests for thyroid function tests from primary care on adult patients. BACKGROUND: Hypopituitarism occurs in about 4 people per 100 000 per year. Loss of thyrotropin (TSH) secretion may lead to secondary hypothyroidism with a low TSH and low FT4, and this pattern may help to diagnose hypopituitarism that might otherwise be missed. DESIGN: Markov model simulation. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), the ratio of cost in pounds to benefit in quality-adjusted life years of this strategy. RESULTS: The ICER for this strategy was pound71 437. Factors with a large influence on the ICER were the utilities of the treated hypopituitary state, the likelihood of going to the general practitioner (GP) and of the GP recognising a hypopituitary patient. The ICER would be below pound20 000 at a cost to the user of an FT4 measurement of pound0.61.

22852,Routine fixation of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures is not cost-effective: a cost analysis from a randomized controlled trial,"AIMS: The primary aim of this study was to establish the cost-effectiveness of the early fixation of displaced midshaft clavicle fractures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cost analysis was conducted within a randomized controlled trial comparing conservative management (n = 92) versus early plate fixation (n = 86) of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to express the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). The Six-Dimension Short-Form Health Survey (SF-6D) score was used as the preference-based health index to calculate the cost per QALY at 12 months after the injury. RESULTS: The mean 12-month SF-6D was 0.9522 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9355 to 0.9689) following conservative management and 0.9607 (95% CI 0.9447 to 0.9767) following fixation, giving an advantage for fixation of 0.0085, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.46). The mean cost per patient was pound1322.69 for conservative management and pound5405.32 for early fixation. This gave an ICER of pound480 309.41 per QALY. For a threshold of pound20 000 per QALY, the benefit of fixation would need to be present for 24 years to be cost-effective compared with conservative treatment. Linear regression analysis identified nonunion as the only factor to adversely influence the SF-6D at 12 months (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Routine plate fixation of displaced midshaft clavicular fractures is not cost-effective. Nonunion following conservative management has an increased morbidity with comparable expense to early fixation. This may suggest that a targeted approach of fixation in patients who are at higher risk of nonunion would be more cost-effective than the routine fixation of all displaced fractures.

22853,Cost-effectiveness of an environmental cleaning bundle for reducing healthcare associated infections,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remain a significant patient safety issue, with point prevalence estimates being approximately 5% in high-income countries. In 2016 - 17, the Researching Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals (REACH) trial implemented an environmental cleaning bundle targeting communication, staff training, improved cleaning technique, product use and audit of frequent touch point cleaning. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the environmental cleaning bundle for reducing the incidence of HAIs. METHODS: A stepped-wedge cluster randomised trial was conducted in eleven hospitals recruited from six Australian states and territories. Bundle effectiveness was measured by the numbers of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB), Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) infections prevented in the intervention phase, based on estimated reductions in the relative risk of infection. Changes to costs were defined as the cost of implementing the bundle minus cost savings from fewer infections. Health benefits gained from fewer infections were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and net monetary benefit of adopting the cleaning bundle over existing hospital cleaning practices. RESULTS: Implementing the cleaning bundle cost AUD$349,000 and generated $147,500 in cost savings. Infections prevented under the cleaning bundle returned a net monetary benefit of AUD$1.02 million and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $4,684 per QALY gained. There was an 86% chance that the bundle was cost-effective compared with existing hospital cleaning practices.

22854,"Comparative Cost-effectiveness of Surgery, Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum, and Penile Traction Therapy in Men with Peyronie's Disease in an Era of Effective Clinical Treatment","BACKGROUND: Traditionally, surgery has been considered the gold standard treatment for Peyronie''s disease (PD). Less-invasive alternatives, such as collagenase Clostridium histolyticum (CCH) and traction therapy, have been proposed and proven effective. AIM: To compare cost-effectiveness of management options for PD. METHODS: A Markov analytic model was created to compare the cost-effectiveness of treatment with a novel traction device, RestoreX (RXPTT), vs CCH vs surgery. Outcomes were derived from single-institution, prospective data of 63 men treated with RXPTT, 115 with CCH, and 23 with plication or incision and grafting. Costs were based on 2017 Medicare reimbursement and utility values from the literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Model outcomes included complications for each treatment arm, as well as the probability of success, which was defined as >/=20% improvement in curvature. Univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Overall success rates were 96% (surgery), 66% (CCH), and 48% (RXPTT). At 10 years after treatment, RXPTT was the most cost-effective, with mean costs per patient of $883 (RXPTT), $11,419 (surgery), and $33,628 (CCH). CCH and surgery both resulted in a gain of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to RXPTT (9.44 and 9.36 vs 9.27, respectively). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated greater cost-effectiveness for surgery if lower (</=46%) rates of postoperative erectile dysfunction or length loss (</=3%). CCH became more cost-effective at lower costs (</=$16,726) or higher success rates (>/=76%). On multivariable sensitivity analysis at a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, the most cost-effective strategy was RXPTT in 49%, surgery in 48%, and CCH in 3% of simulations. At a willingness to treat threshold of $150,000/QALY, the most cost-effective treatment option was RXPTT in 33%, surgery in 55%, and CCH in 12% of simulations. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In an era of value-based care, this model can guide cost-effective treatment selection on the basis of provider, patient, and payer characteristics. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: The current study represents the first cost-effectiveness comparison of treatment modalities for PD and is strengthened by prospective data collection, large CCH and traction sample sizes, and robust sensitivity analyses. Consistent with cost-effective models, the model is limited by assumptions and may not apply to all scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: RXPTT represents a more cost-effective method for achieving >/=20% curvature improvement compared with surgery or CCH. Depending on treatment goals, rate of surgical complications, and willingness to pay threshold, surgery and CCH may become more cost-effective in select scenarios. Wymer K, Kohler T, Trost L.

Costs were based on 2017 Medicare reimbursement and utility values from the literature. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Model outcomes included complications for each treatment arm, as well as the probability of success, which was defined as >/=20% improvement in curvature. Univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: Overall success rates were 96% (surgery), 66% (CCH), and 48% (RXPTT). At 10 years after treatment, RXPTT was the most cost-effective, with mean costs per patient of $883 (RXPTT), $11,419 (surgery), and $33,628 (CCH). CCH and surgery both resulted in a gain of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) relative to RXPTT (9.44 and 9.36 vs 9.27, respectively). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated greater cost-effectiveness for surgery if lower (</=46%) rates of postoperative erectile dysfunction or length loss (</=3%). CCH became more cost-effective at lower costs (</=$16,726) or higher success rates (>/=76%). On multivariable sensitivity analysis at a willingness to pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, the most cost-effective strategy was RXPTT in 49%, surgery in 48%, and CCH in 3% of simulations. At a willingness to treat threshold of $150,000/QALY, the most cost-effective treatment option was RXPTT in 33%, surgery in 55%, and CCH in 12% of simulations. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In an era of value-based care, this model can guide cost-effective treatment selection on the basis of provider, patient, and payer characteristics. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: The current study represents the first cost-effectiveness comparison of treatment modalities for PD and is strengthened by prospective data collection, large CCH and traction sample sizes, and robust sensitivity analyses. Consistent with cost-effective models, the model is limited by assumptions and may not apply to all scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: RXPTT represents a more cost-effective method for achieving >/=20% curvature improvement compared with surgery or CCH. Depending on treatment goals, rate of surgical complications, and willingness to pay threshold, surgery and CCH may become more cost-effective in select scenarios. Wymer K, Kohler T, Trost L.

Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of (18)F-choline PET/multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) versus mpMRI alone for the detection of primary prostate cancer with a Gleason score of greater than or equal to 3 + 4 in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. Methods: A Markov model of prostate cancer onset and progression was used to estimate the health and economic consequences of (18)F-choline PET/mpMRI for the detection of primary prostate cancer with a Gleason score of greater than or equal to 3 + 4 in men with elevated prostate-specific antigen levels. Multiple simultaneous hybrid (18)F-choline PET/mpMRI strategies were evaluated using Likert or Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System version 2 (PI-RADSv2) scoring; the first was biopsy for Likert 5 mpMRI lesions or Likert 3-4 lesions with (18)F-choline target-to-background ratios of greater than or equal to 1.58, and the second was biopsy for PI-RADSv2 5 mpMRI lesions or PI-RADSv2 3-4 mpMRI lesions with (18)F-choline target-to-background ratios of greater than or equal to 1.58. These strategies were compared with universal standard biopsy, mpMRI alone with biopsy only for PI-RADSv2 3-5 lesions, and mpMRI alone with biopsy only for Likert 4-5 lesions. For each mpMRI strategy, either no biopsy or standard biopsy could be performed after negative mpMRI results were obtained. Deaths averted, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated for each strategy. Results: When the results of (18)F-choline PET/mpMRI were negative, performing a standard biopsy was more expensive and had lower QALYs than performing no biopsy. The best screening strategy among those considered in this study performed hybrid (18)F-choline PET/mpMRI with Likert scoring on men with elevated PSA, performed combined biopsy (targeted biopsy and standard 12-core biopsy) for men with positive imaging results, and no biopsy for men with negative imaging results ($22,706/QALY gained relative to mpMRI alone); this strategy reduced the number of biopsies by 35% in comparison to mpMRI alone.

22859,Cost-effectiveness of advanced life support and prehospital critical care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in England: a decision analysis model,"OBJECTIVES: This research aimed to answer the following questions: What are the costs of prehospital advanced life support (ALS) and prehospital critical care for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA)? What is the cost-effectiveness of prehospital ALS? What improvement in survival rates from OHCA would prehospital critical care need to achieve in order to be cost-effective? SETTING: A single National Health Service ambulance service and a charity-funded prehospital critical care service in England. PARTICIPANTS: The patient population is adult, non-traumatic OHCA. METHODS: We combined data from previously published research with data provided by a regional ambulance service and air ambulance charity to create a decision tree model, coupled with a Markov model, of costs and outcomes following OHCA. We compared no treatment for OHCA to the current standard of care of prehospital ALS, and prehospital ALS to prehospital critical care. To reflect the uncertainty in the underlying data, we used probabilistic and two-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Costs of prehospital ALS and prehospital critical care were pound347 and pound1711 per patient, respectively. When costs and outcomes of prehospital, in-hospital and postdischarge phase of OHCA care were combined, prehospital ALS was estimated to be cost-effective at pound11 407/quality-adjusted life year. In order to be cost-effective in addition to ALS, prehospital critical care for OHCA would need to achieve a minimally economically important difference (MEID) in survival to hospital discharge of 3%-5%. CONCLUSION: This is the first economic analysis to address the question of cost-effectiveness of prehospital critical care following OHCA. While costs of either prehospital ALS and/or critical care per patient with OHCA are relatively low, significant costs are incurred during hospital treatment and after discharge in patients who survive. Knowledge of the MEID for prehospital critical care can guide future research in this field.

However, China has not released national PrEP guidelines, and HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM) is unchanged despite substantial scale-up of ART. We evaluated reductions in HIV transmission that may be achieved through early initiation of ART plus partners'' PrEP. METHODS: Six intervention scenarios were evaluated in terms of their impact on HIV transmission and their cost-effectiveness for 36 months post-infection. Three scenarios were based on observed data: non-ART, standard-ART, and early-ART. Another three scenarios were based on observed and hypothetical data: non-ART plus partners'' PrEP, standard-ART plus partners'' PrEP, and early-ART plus partners'' PrEP. The number of onward transmissions was calculated according to viral load and self-reported sexual behaviors, and calibrated by the prevalence and incidence of HIV among Chinese MSM. Cost-effectiveness outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost-utility ratio (CUR). RESULTS: The estimated number of onward transmissions by every 100 HIV-positive cases 36 months post-infection was 41.83 (95% credible interval: 30.75-57.69) in the non-ART scenario, 7.95 (5.85-10.95) in the early-ART scenario, and 0.79 (0.58-1.09) in the early-ART plus partners'' PrEP scenario. Compared with non-ART, the early-ART and early-ART plus partners'' PrEP scenarios were associated with an 81.0 and 98.1% reduction in HIV transmission, and had a CUR of $12,864/QALY and $16,817/QALY, respectively.

The number of onward transmissions was calculated according to viral load and self-reported sexual behaviors, and calibrated by the prevalence and incidence of HIV among Chinese MSM. Cost-effectiveness outcomes were quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and cost-utility ratio (CUR). RESULTS: The estimated number of onward transmissions by every 100 HIV-positive cases 36 months post-infection was 41.83 (95% credible interval: 30.75-57.69) in the non-ART scenario, 7.95 (5.85-10.95) in the early-ART scenario, and 0.79 (0.58-1.09) in the early-ART plus partners'' PrEP scenario. Compared with non-ART, the early-ART and early-ART plus partners'' PrEP scenarios were associated with an 81.0 and 98.1% reduction in HIV transmission, and had a CUR of $12,864/QALY and $16,817/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated delivery of early ART and sexual partners'' PrEP could nearly eliminate HIV transmission and reduce costs during the first 36 months of HIV infection.

METHODS: A patient-level simulation model was developed to predict costs and outcomes associated with four biological drugs (abatacept, tocilizumab, rituximab and TNF inhibitors) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Following lack of efficacy or adverse events, the patients were switched to another biological drug until all four options were exhausted. After that, the patients were assumed to receive a 6th line treatment until death. The patients'' baseline characteristics and regression models used in the simulation were based on observational data from the National Register for Biological Treatments in Finland. Direct costs comprised drug costs, administration costs, costs of switching, and outpatient and inpatient care, while indirect costs included disability pension and sick leaves due to rheumatoid arthritis. Several subgroup and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Drug costs were the lowest for rituximab, but when administration costs and costs of switching were included, drug costs were the lowest for TNF inhibitors. Abatacept was associated with the highest drug costs, whereas rituximab was associated with the highest healthcare costs. In total, TNF inhibitors had the lowest direct costs, while rituximab had the highest direct costs. The amount of quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained ranged from 9.405 for rituximab to 9.661 for TNF inhibitors. TNF inhibitors, abatacept, and tocilizumab were dominant in comparison to RTX.

METHODS: A total of 106 obese T2D individuals who underwent RYGB and 106 T2D patients treated with CMM were enrolled from three academic medical centers. Total health related costs, Glycated Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) and BMI was recorded. Cost-Utility Analysis (CUA) was used. Utility values according to results of A1c were obtained from published studies. RESULTS: Improvements were observed in A1C (8.6% at baseline to 6.2% in the first year, p < 0.001) and BMI (30.7 kg/m(2) at baseline to 24.3 kg/m(2) in the first year, p < 0.001), and the effect lasted for 4 years after RYGB. In the CMM group, A1C fluctuated in four years. The health utility for RYGB group scores 3.756, whereas CMM group scores 3.594 in four years. The total healthcare costs decreased sharply from the second year after RYGB ($8,483 [ yen52,596] in the first year to $672[ yen4,164] in the second year, p < 0.001) and maintained for 3 years. In the CMM group, the total healthcare costs changed without significance. RYGB costs US$19,359 ( yen125,836) per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained (incremental cost-utility ratio [ICUR]) compared to CMM, which was lower than a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of $20,277/QALY.

22869,FDA Sodium Reduction Targets and the Food Industry: Are There Incentives to Reformulate? Microsimulation Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"Policy Points The World Health Organization has recommended sodium reduction as a ""best buy"" to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Despite this, Congress has temporarily blocked the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) from implementing voluntary industry targets for sodium reduction in processed foods, the implementation of which could cost the industry around $16 billion over 10 years. We modeled the health and economic impact of meeting the two-year and ten-year FDA targets, from the perspective of people working in the food system itself, over 20 years, from 2017 to 2036. Benefits of implementing the FDA voluntary sodium targets extend to food companies and food system workers, and the value of CVD-related health gains and cost savings are together greater than the government and industry costs of reformulation. CONTEXT: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set draft voluntary targets to reduce sodium levels in processed foods. We aimed to determine cost effectiveness of meeting these draft sodium targets, from the perspective of US food system workers. METHODS: We employed a microsimulation cost-effectiveness analysis using the US IMPACT Food Policy model with two scenarios: (1) short term, achieving two-year FDA reformulation targets only, and (2) long term, achieving 10-year FDA reformulation targets. We modeled four close-to-reality populations: food system ""ever"" workers; food system ""current"" workers in 2017; and subsets of processed food ""ever"" and ""current"" workers. Outcomes included cardiovascular disease cases prevented and postponed as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained from 2017 to 2036. FINDINGS: Among food system ever workers, achieving long-term sodium reduction targets could produce 20-year health gains of approximately 180,000 QALYs (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 150,000 to 209,000) and health cost savings of approximately $5.2 billion (95% UI: $3.5 billion to $8.3 billion), with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $62,000 (95% UI: $1,000 to $171,000) per QALY gained. For the subset of processed food industry workers, health gains would be approximately 32,000 QALYs (95% UI: 27,000 to 37,000); cost savings, $1.0 billion (95% UI: $0.7bn to $1.6bn); and ICER, $486,000 (95% UI: $148,000 to $1,094,000) per QALY gained. Because many health benefits may occur in individuals older than 65 or the uninsured, these health savings would be shared among individuals, industry, and government.

22873,Cost-Utility of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Fibromyalgia versus a Multicomponent Intervention and Usual Care: A 12-Month Randomized Controlled Trial (EUDAIMON Study),"Fibromyalgia (FM) is a prevalent, chronic, disabling, pain syndrome that implies high healthcare costs. Economic evaluations of potentially effective treatments for FM are needed. The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-utility of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) as an add-on to treatment-as-usual (TAU) for patients with FM compared to an adjuvant multicomponent intervention (""FibroQoL"") and to TAU. We performed an economic evaluation alongside a 12 month, randomized, controlled trial; data from 204 (68 per study arm) of the 225 patients (90.1%) were included in the cost-utility analyses, which were conducted both under the government and the public healthcare system perspectives. The main outcome measures were the EuroQol (EQ-5D-5L) for assessing Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and improvements in health-related quality of life, and the Client Service Receipt Inventory (CSRI) for estimating direct and indirect costs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were also calculated. Two sensitivity analyses (intention-to-treat, ITT, and per protocol, PPA) were conducted.

22876,The clinical and cost-effectiveness of total versus partial knee replacement in patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis (TOPKAT): 5-year outcomes of a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Late-stage isolated medial knee osteoarthritis can be treated with total knee replacement (TKR) or partial knee replacement (PKR). There is high variation in treatment choice and little robust evidence to guide selection. The Total or Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial (TOPKAT) therefore aims to assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of TKR versus PKR in patients with medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee, and this represents an analysis of the main endpoints at 5 years. METHODS: Our multicentre, pragmatic randomised controlled trial was done at 27 UK sites. We used a combined expertise-based and equipoise-based approach, in which patients with isolated osteoarthritis of the medial compartment of the knee and who satisfied general requirements for a medial PKR were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive PKR or TKR by surgeons who were either expert in and willing to perform both surgeries or by a surgeon with particular expertise in the allocated procedure. The primary endpoint was the Oxford Knee Score (OKS) 5 years after randomisation in all patients assigned to groups. Health-care costs (in UK 2017 prices) and cost-effectiveness were also assessed. This trial is registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN03013488) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01352247). FINDINGS: Between Jan 18, 2010, and Sept 30, 2013, we assessed 962 patients for their eligibility, of whom 431 (45%) patients were excluded (121 [13%] patients did not meet the inclusion criteria and 310 [32%] patients declined to participate) and 528 (55%) patients were randomly assigned to groups. 94% of participants responded to the follow-up survey 5 years after their operation. At the 5-year follow-up, we found no difference in OKS between groups (mean difference 1.04, 95% CI -0.42 to 2.50; p=0.159). In our within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis, we found that PKR was more effective (0.240 additional quality-adjusted life-years, 95% CI 0.046 to 0.434) and less expensive (- pound910, 95% CI -1503 to -317) than TKR during the 5 years of follow-up. This finding was a result of slightly better outcomes, lower costs of surgery, and lower follow-up health-care costs with PKR than TKR. INTERPRETATION: Both TKR and PKR are effective, offer similar clinical outcomes, and result in a similar incidence of re-operations and complications. Based on our clinical findings, and results regarding the lower costs and better cost-effectiveness with PKR during the 5-year study period, we suggest that PKR should be considered the first choice for patients with late-stage isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis.

22879,Cost-Effectiveness of Extended Thromboprophylaxis in Patients Undergoing Colorectal Surgery from a Canadian Health Care System Perspective,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence to support extended thromboprophylaxis after colorectal surgery to minimize the incidence of postdischarge venous thromboembolic events. However, the absolute number of events is small, and extended thromboprophylaxis requires significant resources from the health care system. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of extended thromboprophylaxis in patients undergoing colorectal surgery for malignancy or IBD. DESIGN: An individualized patient microsimulation model (1,000,000 patients; 1-month cycle length) comparing extended thromboprophylaxis (28-day course of enoxaparin) to standard management (inpatient administration only) after colorectal surgery was constructed. SETTINGS: The sources for this study were The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project Participant User File and literature searches. OUTCOMES: Costs (Canadian dollars), quality-adjusted life-years, and venous thromboembolism-related deaths prevented over a 1-year time horizon starting with hospital discharge were determined. The results were stratified by malignancy or IBD. RESULTS: In patients with malignancy, extended prophylaxis was associated with higher costs (+113$; 95% CI, 102-123), but increased quality-adjusted life-years (+0.05; 95% CI, 0.04-0.06), resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2473$/quality-adjusted life-year. For IBD, extended prophylaxis also had higher costs (+116$; 95% CI, 109-123), more quality-adjusted life-years (+0.05; 95% CI, 0.04-0.06), and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2475$/quality-adjusted life-year. Extended prophylaxis prevented 16 (95% CI, 4-27) venous thromboembolism-related deaths per 100,000 patients and 22 (95% CI, 6-38) for malignancy and IBD. There was a 99.7% probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 50,000$/quality-adjusted life-year. To account for statistical uncertainty around variables, sensitivity analysis was performed and found that extended prophylaxis is associated with lower overall costs when the incidence of postdischarge venous thromboembolic events reaches 1.8%. LIMITATIONS: Significant differences in health care systems may affect the generalizability of our results. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the rarity of venous thromboembolic events, extended thromboprophylaxis is a cost-effective strategy. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/DCR/A976.

This gene therapy is associated with high up-front costs and high efficacy, although of unknown duration, and its cost-effectiveness has not been assessed with RPE65 IRD-specific, longitudinal, patient-observation-level data. Objective: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl compared with standard care for RPE65-mediated inherited retinal disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic analysis, a health state transition model based on visual acuity and field with a lifetime horizon was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl. The model was populated with data from a clinical trial of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl to evaluate treatment outcome and a natural history study of RPE65-mediated IRD to examine disease progression. Direct costs were derived from the literature. Indirect costs, including educational attainment, productivity, caregiver burden, and governmental programs, were estimated using published literature and data analysis of public national surveys. A health utility vignette study specific to RPE65-mediated IRD was used for health utility inputs. The cost-effectiveness study described in this article was conducted from September 15, 2017, to August 23, 2018. Exposures: Bilateral voretigene neparvovec-rzyl therapy or standard care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: The model population included 70 patients with RPE65-mediated IRD, with a mean age of 15 years; 42 of 70 patients (60%) were female. In the base case, voretigene neparvovec-rzyl compared with standard care was associated with lower total costs ($2.2 million vs $2.8 million) and higher quality-adjusted life-years (18.1 vs 8.6). Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl remains cost-effective if at least 8.8% of the long-term treatment effect continues after year 3 when including indirect costs and 43.3% when excluding indirect costs, assuming a cost threshold of $150000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

This gene therapy is associated with high up-front costs and high efficacy, although of unknown duration, and its cost-effectiveness has not been assessed with RPE65 IRD-specific, longitudinal, patient-observation-level data. Objective: To assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl compared with standard care for RPE65-mediated inherited retinal disease. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic analysis, a health state transition model based on visual acuity and field with a lifetime horizon was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl. The model was populated with data from a clinical trial of voretigene neparvovec-rzyl to evaluate treatment outcome and a natural history study of RPE65-mediated IRD to examine disease progression. Direct costs were derived from the literature. Indirect costs, including educational attainment, productivity, caregiver burden, and governmental programs, were estimated using published literature and data analysis of public national surveys. A health utility vignette study specific to RPE65-mediated IRD was used for health utility inputs. The cost-effectiveness study described in this article was conducted from September 15, 2017, to August 23, 2018. Exposures: Bilateral voretigene neparvovec-rzyl therapy or standard care. Main Outcomes and Measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results: The model population included 70 patients with RPE65-mediated IRD, with a mean age of 15 years; 42 of 70 patients (60%) were female. In the base case, voretigene neparvovec-rzyl compared with standard care was associated with lower total costs ($2.2 million vs $2.8 million) and higher quality-adjusted life-years (18.1 vs 8.6). Voretigene neparvovec-rzyl remains cost-effective if at least 8.8% of the long-term treatment effect continues after year 3 when including indirect costs and 43.3% when excluding indirect costs, assuming a cost threshold of $150000 per quality-adjusted life-year.

22883,Phase I/II Clinical Trial-Based Early Economic Evaluation of Acalabrutinib for Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to construct an early economic evaluation for acalabrutinib for relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to assist early reimbursement decision making. Scenarios were assessed to find the relative impact of critical parameters on incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). METHODS: A partitioned survival model was constructed comparing acalabrutinib and ibrutinib from a UK national health service perspective. This model included states for progression-free survival (PFS), post-progression survival (PPS) and death. PFS and overall survival (OS) were parametrically extrapolated from ibrutinib publications and a preliminary hazard ratio based on phase I/II data was applied for acalabrutinib. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, and 1296 scenarios were assessed. RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound61,941/QALY, with 3.44 incremental QALYs and incremental costs of pound213,339. Deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated that survival estimates, utilities and treatment costs of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib and resource use during PFS have the greatest influence on the ICER. Probabilistic results under different development scenarios indicated that greater efficacy of acalabrutinib would decrease the likelihood of cost effectiveness (from 63% at no effect to 2% at maximum efficacy). Scenario analyses showed that a reduction in PFS did not lead to great QALY differences (- 8 to - 14% incremental QALYs) although it did greatly affect costs (- 47 to - 122% incremental pounds). For OS, the opposite was true (- 89 to - 93% QALYs and - 7 to - 39% pounds). CONCLUSIONS: Acalabrutinib is not likely to be cost effective compared with ibrutinib under current development scenarios. The conflicting effects of OS, PFS, drug costs and utility during PFS show that determining the cost effectiveness of acalabrutinib without insight into all parameters complicates health technology assessment decision making. Early assessment of the cost effectiveness of new products can support development choices and reimbursement processes through effective early dialogues between stakeholders.",2019-01-32374,31317510,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Rick A Vreman,2019,17 / 6,883-893,Yes,31317510,"Rick A Vreman; Sandra Diekmann; Laura Horster; Silvia Evers; Mickael Hiligsmann; Gotz Gelbrich; Klaus Groschel; Rolf Wachter; Gerhard F Hamann; Pawel Kermer; Jan Liman; Mark Weber-Kruger; Jurgen Wasem; Anja Neumann; Find-AFRANDOMISED Investigators; Phase I/II Clinical Trial-Based Early Economic Evaluation of Acalabrutinib for Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2019 Dec; 17(6):1179-1896; 883-893",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,acalabrutinib vs. Ibrutinib,Chronic lymphocytic disease,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,61941,United Kingdom,2018,85308.14
22884,"Cost effectiveness of Gene Expression Profiling in Patients with Early-Stage Breast Cancer in a Middle-Income Country, Turkey: Results of a Prospective Multicenter Study","Objective: Breast cancer is a heterogenous disease, and genetic profiling helps to individualize adjuvant treatment. The Oncotype DX is a validated test to predict benefit of adjuvant systemic treatment. The aims of this study are to determine the costs of chemotherapy in government hospitals in Turkey and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Oncotype DX from the national insurance perspective. Materials and Methods: A Markov model was developed to make long term projections of distant recurrence, survival, quality adjusted life expectancy, and direct costs for patients with ER+, HER2-, node-negative or up to 3 node-positive early stage breast cancer. Turkish decision impact study patient data were captured for model reference. In that study, ten academic centers across Turkey participated in a prospective trial. Of 165 patients with pT1-3, pN0-N1mic, ER-positive, and HER-2 negative tumors, 57% had low recurrence score (RS), 35% had intermediate RS, and 8% had high RS, respectively. The overall rate of change in chemotherapy treatment decisions following Oncotype DX was 33%. Results: The cost of adjuvant chemotherapy in public hospitals was estimated at $3.649, and Oncotype Dx test was $5.141. Based on the cost-effectiveness analysis, Oncotype DX testing was estimated to improve life expectancy (+0.86 years) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (+0.68 QALYs) versus standard care. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICERs) of Oncotype DX was estimated to be $7207.9 per QALY gained and $5720.6 per LY gained versus current clinical practice. Conclusion: As Oncotype DX was found both cost-effective and life-saving from a national perspective, the test should be introduced to standard care in patients with ER+, HER-2 negative early-stage breast cancer in Turkey.",2019-01-32379,31312795,Eur J Breast Health,Vahit Ozmen,2019,15 / 3,183-190,No,31312795,"Vahit Ozmen; C L Niedzwiedz; Cost effectiveness of Gene Expression Profiling in Patients with Early-Stage Breast Cancer in a Middle-Income Country, Turkey: Results of a Prospective Multicenter Study, Eur J Breast Health, 2019 Jul; 15(3):2587-0831; 183-190",QALY,Turkey,Not Stated,"Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical, Screening",oncotype dx testing with adjuvant systemic treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- Standard endocrine therapy and chemotherapy regimens,"ER+, HER2-, node-negative or up to 3 node-positive early stage breast cancer",Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,30 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,7207.9,United States,2016,7772.62

22892,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Erenumab Versus OnabotulinumtoxinA for Patients with Chronic Migraine Attacks in Greece,"BACKGROUND: Migraine is a common, chronic neurovascular brain disorder with non-negligible multifaceted economic costs. Existing preventive treatments involve the selective use of onabotulinumtoxinA, which aims at migraine morbidity reduction for patients who have failed initial preventive treatment with oral agents. Erenumab is a new preventive treatment for migraines. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differences in costs and outcomes of the preventive treatment with erenumab versus onabotulinumtoxinA in patients with chronic migraines (CM) in Greece to assess the economic value of this treatment. METHODS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis from both the payer and the societal perspective using a decision-tree analytic model. Outcomes were expressed in migraines avoided and in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We obtained model inputs from the existing literature. The decision path adjusted for variation in the probability of adherence and the resulting differential effectiveness between the two treatments. Direct costs included the cost of the two drugs and administration costs, the costs of acute drugs used under usual care, and the costs of hospitalization, physician, and emergency department visits. Indirect costs for the societal perspective analyses included wages lost on workdays. The time-horizon of the analysis was 1 year and all costs were calculated in 2019 euros (euro). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to control for parameter uncertainty and to evaluate the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: Our results indicate that treatment of CM with erenumab compared to onabotulinumtoxinA resulted in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of euro218,870 and euro231,554 per QALY gained and euro620 and euro656 per migraine avoided, from the societal and the payer''s perspective, respectively. Using a common cost-effectiveness threshold equal to three times the local gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (euro49,000), for the erenumab ICERs to fall below this threshold, the erenumab price would have to be no more than euro192 (societal perspective) or euro173 (payer perspective). CONCLUSION: The prophylactic treatment of CM with erenumab in Greece might be cost effective compared to the existing alternative of onabotulinumtoxinA from both the payer and the societal perspective, but only at a highly discounted price. Nevertheless, erenumab could be considered a therapeutic option for patients who fail treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA.",2019-01-32404,31302899,Clin Drug Investig,Theodoros V Giannouchos,2019,39 / 10,979-990,Yes,31302899,"Theodoros V Giannouchos; Iman Alaie; Sara Brolin Laftman; Ulf Jonsson; Hannes Bohman; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Erenumab Versus OnabotulinumtoxinA for Patients with Chronic Migraine Attacks in Greece, Clin Drug Investig, 2019 Oct; 39(10):1173-2563; 979-990",QALY,Greece,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,erenumab vs. OnabotulinumtoxinA,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,218870,Euro,2019,248187.17
22893,"Cost-effectiveness of meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine in Australian adolescents","OBJECTIVES: The incidence of invasive meningitis disease (IMD) is increasing in Australia. A conjugate vaccine of meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups A, C, W and Y (MenACWY) is currently indicated for infants aged 12months on the Australian National Immunisation Program. This study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of a broader MenACWY vaccination program for Australians aged 15 to 19years. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the incidence and consequences of IMD in Australians aged 0-84years, with follow up until age 85years. The model comprised four health states: ''Alive with no previous IMD'', ''Alive, post IMD without long-term complications'', ''Alive, post IMD with long-term complications'' and ''Dead''. Decision analysis compared the clinical consequences and costs of a vaccination program versus no vaccination from the perspective of the Australian health care system. Age-specific incidence of IMD and fatality rates were derived from Australian surveillance data. Vaccine coverage, vaccine efficacy and herd immunity were based on published data. The total cost for MenACWY vaccination was AU$56 per dose. Costs and health outcomes were discounted by 5% per annum (in the base-case analysis). RESULTS: Compared to no vaccination, a MenACWY vaccination program targeted at Australians aged 15-19years was expected to prevent 1664 IMD cases in the Australian population aged 0-84years followed up until age 85years. The program would lead to 1131 life years (LYs) and 2058 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained at a total cost of AU$115 million (all discounted values). These equated to incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of AU$101,649 per LY gained and AU$55,857 per QALY gained. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated a likelihood of cost-effectiveness of 34.6%, assuming a willingness to pay threshold of AU$50,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The likelihood of this program being cost-effective under a willingness to pay threshold AU$50,000 per QALY gained is 35%.",2019-01-32408,31301916,Vaccine,Si Si,2019,37 / 35,5009-5015,Yes,31301916,"Si Si; Jennifer Freeman; Wendy Hendrie; Louise Jarrett; Annie Hawton; Andrew Barton; Rachel Dennett; Ben Jones; John Zajicek; Siobhan Creanor; Cost-effectiveness of meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups A, C, W-135 and Y conjugate vaccine in Australian adolescents, Vaccine, 2019 Aug 14; 37(35):1873-2518; 5009-5015",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Immunization,"meningococal polysaccharide serogroups a, c, w and y(menacwy) vaccination vs. None",Not Stated,19 Years,15 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,55857,Australia,2018,43032.14
22894,"Assessment of a home-based standing frame programme in people with progressive multiple sclerosis (SUMS): a pragmatic, multi-centre, randomised, controlled trial and cost-effectiveness analysis","BACKGROUND: People severely impaired with progressive multiple sclerosis spend much of their day sitting, with very few options to improve motor function. As a result, secondary physical and psychosocial complications can occur. Effective and feasible self-management strategies are needed to reduce sedentary behaviour and enhance motor function. In this study, we aimed to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a home-based, self-managed, standing frame programme. METHODS: SUMS was a pragmatic, multicentre, randomised controlled superiority trial of people with progressive multiple sclerosis and severe mobility impairment, undertaken in eight centres from two regions in the UK. The study had assessor-blinded outcome assessments with use of clinician-rated and patient-rated measures at baseline, 20 weeks, and 36 weeks. After baseline assessment, participants were randomised (1:1) by computer-generated assignment to either a standing frame programme plus usual care or usual care alone. The intervention consisted of two home-based physiotherapy sessions (60 min each) to set up the standing frame programme, supported by six follow-up telephone calls (15 min per call). Participants were asked to stand for 30 min, three times per week over 20 weeks, and encouraged to continue in the longer term, although no further physiotherapy support was provided. The primary clinical outcome was motor function measured by the Amended Motor Club Assessment (AMCA) score at week 36, analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population (excluding only patients who were deemed ineligible after randomisation, those who withdrew from the trial and were unwilling for their previously collected data to be used, or those who did not provide baseline and week 36 measurements). A 9-point AMCA score change was considered clinically meaningful a priori. Adverse events were collected through a daily preformatted patient diary throughout the 36 weeks and analysed in the modified intention-to-treat population. An economic assessment established the resources required to provide the standing frame programme, estimated intervention costs, and estimate cost effectiveness. This trial is registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials, number ISRCTN69614598. FINDINGS: Between Sept 16, 2015, and April 28, 2017, 285 people with progressive multiple sclerosis were screened for eligibility, and 140 were randomly assigned to either the standing frame group (n=71) or the usual care group (n=69). Of these, 122 completed the primary outcome assessment (61 participants in both groups) for the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The use of the standing frame resulted in a significant increase in AMCA score compared with that for usual care alone, with a fully adjusted between-group difference in AMCA score at 36 weeks of 4.7 points (95% CI 1.9-7.5; p=0.0014). For adverse events collected through patient diaries, we observed a disparity between the two groups in the frequency of short-term musculoskeletal pain (486 [41%] of 1188 adverse events in the standing frame group vs 160 [22%] of 736 adverse events in the usual care group), which was potentially related to the intervention. The musculoskeletal pain lasted longer than 7 days in five participants (two in the standing frame group and three in the usual care group). No serious adverse events related to the study occurred. The standing frame group had a mean 0.018 (95% CI -0.014 to 0.051) additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with those of the usual care group, and the estimated incremental cost-per-QALY was approximately pound14 700. INTERPRETATION: The standing frame programme significantly increased motor function in people with severe progressive multiple sclerosis, although not to the degree that was considered a priori as clinically meaningful. The standing frame is one of the first physiotherapy interventions to be effective in this population. We suggest that the programme is feasible as a home-based, self-managed intervention that could be routinely implemented in clinical practice in the UK.

22895,Cardiovascular magnetic resonance in emergency patients with multivessel disease or unobstructed coronary arteries: a cost-effectiveness analysis in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To identify the key drivers of cost-effectiveness for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) when patients activate the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) pathway. DESIGN: Economic decision models for two patient subgroups populated from secondary sources, each with a 1 year time horizon from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) and personal social services in the UK. SETTING: Usual care (with or without CMR) in the NHS. PARTICIPANTS: Patients who activated the PPCI pathway, and for Model 1: underwent an emergency coronary angiogram and PPCI, and were found to have multivessel coronary artery disease. For Model 2: underwent an emergency coronary angiogram and were found to have unobstructed coronary arteries. INTERVENTIONS: Model 1 (multivessel disease) compared two different ischaemia testing methods, CMR or fractional flow reserve (FFR), versus stress echocardiography. Model 2 (unobstructed arteries) compared CMR with standard echocardiography versus standard echocardiography alone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Key drivers of cost-effectiveness for CMR, incremental costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: In both models, the incremental costs and QALYs between CMR (or FFR, Model 1) versus no CMR (stress echocardiography, Model 1 and standard echocardiography, Model 2) were small (CMR: - pound64 (95% CI - pound232 to pound187)/FFR: pound360 (95% CI - pound116 to pound844) and CMR/FFR: 0.0012 QALYs (95% CI -0.0076 to 0.0093)) and ( pound98 (95% CI - pound199 to pound488) and 0.0005 QALYs (95% CI -0.0050 to 0.0077)), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of the tests was the key driver of cost-effectiveness for both patient groups. CONCLUSIONS: If CMR were introduced for all subgroups of patients who activate the PPCI pathway, it is likely that diagnostic accuracy would be a key determinant of its cost-effectiveness.

22898,Cost-utility analysis of focal high-intensity focussed ultrasound vs active surveillance for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer using a Markov multi-state model,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the relative cost-effectiveness of focal high-intensity focussed ultrasound (F-HIFU) compared to active surveillance (AS) in patients with low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer, in France. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A Markov multi-state model was elaborated for this purpose. Our analyses were conducted from the French National Health Insurance perspective, with a time horizon of 10 years and a 4% discount rate for cost and effectiveness. A secondary analysis used a 30-year time horizon. Costs are presented in 2016 Euros (euro), and effectiveness is expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Model parameters'' value (probabilities for transitions between health states, and cost and utility of health states) is supported by systematic literature reviews (PubMed) and random effect meta-analyses. The cost of F-HIFU in our model was the temporary tariff attributed by the French Ministry of Health to the overall treatment of prostate cancer by HIFU (euro6047). Our model was analysed using Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA, USA). Uncertainty about the value of the model parameters was handled through probabilistic analyses. RESULTS: The five health states of our model were as follows: initial state (AS or F-HIFU), radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, metastasis, and death. Transition probabilities from the initial F-HIFU state relied on four articles eligible for our meta-analyses. All were non-comparative studies. Utilities relied on a single cohort in San Diego, CA, USA. For a fictive cohort of 1000 individuals followed for 10 years, F-HIFU would be euro207 520 more costly and would yield 382 less QALYs than AS, which means that AS is cost-effective when compared to F-HIFU. For a threshold value varying from euro0 to 100 000/QALY, the probability of AS being cost-effective compared to F-HIFU varied from 56.5% to 60%. This level of uncertainty was in the same range with a 30-year time horizon. CONCLUSION: Given existing published data, our results suggest that AS is cost-effective compared to F-HIFU in patients with low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer, but with high uncertainty. This uncertainty must be scaled down by continuing to supply the model with new published data and ideally through a randomised clinical trial that includes cost-effectiveness analyses.",2019-01-32416,31298775,BJU Int,Antoine Benard,2019,124 / 6,962-971,No,31298775,"Antoine Benard; Claudia Buntrock; Fanny Kahlke; Filip Smit; David Daniel Ebert; Cost-utility analysis of focal high-intensity focussed ultrasound vs active surveillance for low- to intermediate-risk prostate cancer using a Markov multi-state model, BJU Int, 2019 Dec; 124(6):1464-4096; 962-971",QALY,French Republic,Not Stated,"Medical Device, Medical Procedure",focal high-intensity focussed ultrasound vs. Standard/Usual Care- Active surveillance,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Male,Full,"10 Years, 30 years",4.00,4.00,-2670.8,Euro,2016,-3186.95

We incorporated their screening frequency and screening and diagnostic costs. RESULTS: Within the NBCCEDP, Program with PN (vs. No PN) resulted in a greater number of mammograms per woman (4.23 vs. 4.14), lower lifetime mortality from breast cancer (3.53% vs. 3.61%), and fewer missed diagnostic resolution per woman (0.017 vs. 0.025).
