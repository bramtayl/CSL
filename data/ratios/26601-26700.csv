26601,"Costs, health effects and cost-effectiveness of alcohol and tobacco control strategies in Estonia","OBJECTIVE: To assess the population-level costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of different alcohol and tobacco control strategies in Estonia. DESIGN: A WHO cost-effectiveness modelling framework was used to estimate the total costs and effects of interventions. Costs were assessed in Estonian Kroon (EEK) for the year 2000, while effects were expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Regional cost-effectiveness estimates for Eastern Europe, were used as baseline and were contextualised by including country-specific input data. RESULTS: Increased excise taxes are the most cost-effective intervention to reduce both hazardous alcohol consumption and smoking: 759 EEK (euro 49) and 218 EEK (euro 14) per DALY averted, respectively. Imposing additional advertising bans would cost 1331 EEK (euro 85) per DALY averted to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption and 304 EEK (euro 19) to reduce smoking. Compared to WHO-CHOICE regional estimates, interventions were less costly and thereby more cost-effective in Estonia. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions in alcohol and tobacco control are cost-effective, and broad implementation of these interventions to upgrade current situation is warranted from the economic point of view. First priority is an increase in taxation, followed by advertising bans and other interventions.

26615,"Costs, health effects and cost-effectiveness of alcohol and tobacco control strategies in Estonia","OBJECTIVE: To assess the population-level costs, effects and cost-effectiveness of different alcohol and tobacco control strategies in Estonia. DESIGN: A WHO cost-effectiveness modelling framework was used to estimate the total costs and effects of interventions. Costs were assessed in Estonian Kroon (EEK) for the year 2000, while effects were expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. Regional cost-effectiveness estimates for Eastern Europe, were used as baseline and were contextualised by including country-specific input data. RESULTS: Increased excise taxes are the most cost-effective intervention to reduce both hazardous alcohol consumption and smoking: 759 EEK (euro 49) and 218 EEK (euro 14) per DALY averted, respectively. Imposing additional advertising bans would cost 1331 EEK (euro 85) per DALY averted to reduce hazardous alcohol consumption and 304 EEK (euro 19) to reduce smoking.

26622,Why invest in a national public health program for stroke? An example using Australian data to estimate the potential benefits and cost implications,"OBJECTIVES: Stroke is the world's second leading cause of death in people aged over 60 years. Approximately 50,000 strokes occur annually in Australia with numbers predicted to increase by about one third over 10-years. Our objectives were to assess the economic implications of a public health program for stroke by: (1) predicting what potential health-gains and cost-offsets could be achieved; and (2) determining the net level of annual investment that would offer value-for-money. METHODS: Lifetime costs and outcomes were calculated for additional cases that would benefit if 'current practice' was feasibly improved, estimated for one indicative year using: (i) local epidemiological data, coverage rates and costs; and (ii) pooled effect sizes from systematic reviews. Interventions: blood pressure lowering; warfarin for atrial fibrillation; increased access to stroke units; intravenous thrombolysis and aspirin for ischemic events; and carotid endarterectomy. Value-for-money threshold: AUD$30,000/DALY recovered. RESULTS: Improved, prevention and management could prevent about 27,000 (38%) strokes in 2015. In present terms (2004), about 85,000 DALYs and AUD$1.06 billion in lifetime cost-offsets could be recovered. The net level of annual warranted investment was AUD$3.63 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Primary prevention, in particular blood pressure lowering, was most effective.

26623,Cost-effectiveness of a folic acid fortification program in Chile,"OBJECTIVE: Periconceptional intake of folic acid reduces the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs), a frequent birth defect that can cause significant infant mortality and disability. In Chile, fortification of wheat flour with folic acid has resulted in significant reduction in the risk of anencephaly and spina bifida. We investigated the cost-effectiveness implications of this policy. METHODS: We conducted an ex-post economic analysis of this intervention. Estimates of the effect of fortification in decreasing NTDs and deaths were derived from a prospective evaluation. The costs of fortification and provision of medical care to children with spina bifida in Chile were based on primary data collection. FINDINGS: The intervention costs per NTD case and infant death averted were I$ 1200 and 11,000, respectively. The cost per DALY averted was I$ 89, 0.8% of Chile's GDP per capita. Taking into account averted costs of care, fortification resulted in net cost savings of I$ 2.3 million. CONCLUSION: Fortification of wheat flour with folic acid is a cost-effective intervention in Chile, a middle income country in the post-epidemiological transition.

26636,Cost-effectiveness of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis among persons with HIV in Uganda,"BACKGROUND: Daily prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) by persons with HIV reduces morbidity and mortality and is recommended by Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization (WHO), but there are limited published cost-effectiveness data for this intervention. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for persons living with HIV in rural Uganda. METHODS: We modeled the cost-effectiveness of daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis based on clinical results and operational data from a prospective cohort study of home-based care delivery to adults and children with HIV in rural Uganda who were older than the age of 5 years. Main outcome measures were net program cost and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) gained. We examined the provision of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for (A) all HIV-infected individuals regardless of immunologic or clinical criteria; (B) those with WHO stage 2 or more advanced disease; (C) those with CD4 cell counts <500 cells/microL; and (D) those meeting criteria B or C, the current WHO recommendation. We calculated the costs and effectiveness of these 4 screening algorithms compared with no cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. We performed univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis for all HIV-infected individuals (algorithm A) produced 7.3 life-years and 7.55 DALYs per 100 persons over 1 year compared with no prophylaxis. Using this screening algorithm, the intervention saved $2.50 per person-year. The program costs and the DALYs gained by algorithms A, B, and D were more favorable than those for algorithm C. Among algorithms A, B, and D, strategies using screening algorithms for WHO stage or CD4 cell counts were more costly and marginally less effective than providing cotrimoxazole prophylaxis to all HIV-infected individuals.

26640,Cost-effectiveness of medical interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease in a sub-Saharan African country--the case of Tanzania,"BACKGROUND: There is a high and rising prevalence of cardiovascular risk in sub-Saharan Africa, a development typical for countries in epidemiological transition. Contrary to recommendations in treatment guidelines, medical interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease are implemented only on a limited scale in these settings. There is a widespread concern that such treatment is not cost-effective compared to alternative health interventions. The main objectives of this article are therefore to calculate costs-, effects and cost-effectiveness of fourteen medical interventions of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Tanzania, including Acetylsalicylic acid, a diuretic drug (Hydrochlorothiazide), a beta-blocker (Atenolol), a calcium channel blocker (Nifedepine), a statin (Lovastatin) and various combinations of these. METHODS: Effect sizes were derived from systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and calculated as Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Data on drug costs were calibrated to a Tanzanian setting. Other recurrent and capital costs were derived from previous studies and reviewed by local experts. Expected lifetime costs and health outcomes were calculated using a life-cycle model. Probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulation, and results presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and frontiers. The potential impacts of uncertainty in value laden single parameters were explored in one-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the fourteen interventions and four different levels of risk (totally 56 alternative interventions) ranged from about USD 85 per DALY to about USD 4589 per DALY saved. Hydrochlorothiazide as monotherapy is the drug yielding the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio, although not significantly lower than when it is combined in duo-therapy with Aspirin or a beta-blocker, in triple-therapy with Aspirin and a beta-blocker, or than Aspirin given as mono-therapy. CONCLUSION: Preventive cardiology is not cost-effective for any patient group in this setting until willingness to pay exceeds USD 85 per DALY.

26644,Cost-effectiveness of medical interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease in a sub-Saharan African country--the case of Tanzania,"BACKGROUND: There is a high and rising prevalence of cardiovascular risk in sub-Saharan Africa, a development typical for countries in epidemiological transition. Contrary to recommendations in treatment guidelines, medical interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease are implemented only on a limited scale in these settings. There is a widespread concern that such treatment is not cost-effective compared to alternative health interventions. The main objectives of this article are therefore to calculate costs-, effects and cost-effectiveness of fourteen medical interventions of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Tanzania, including Acetylsalicylic acid, a diuretic drug (Hydrochlorothiazide), a beta-blocker (Atenolol), a calcium channel blocker (Nifedepine), a statin (Lovastatin) and various combinations of these. METHODS: Effect sizes were derived from systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and calculated as Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). Data on drug costs were calibrated to a Tanzanian setting. Other recurrent and capital costs were derived from previous studies and reviewed by local experts. Expected lifetime costs and health outcomes were calculated using a life-cycle model. Probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using Monte Carlo simulation, and results presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves and frontiers. The potential impacts of uncertainty in value laden single parameters were explored in one-way sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for the fourteen interventions and four different levels of risk (totally 56 alternative interventions) ranged from about USD 85 per DALY to about USD 4589 per DALY saved. Hydrochlorothiazide as monotherapy is the drug yielding the most favorable cost-effectiveness ratio, although not significantly lower than when it is combined in duo-therapy with Aspirin or a beta-blocker, in triple-therapy with Aspirin and a beta-blocker, or than Aspirin given as mono-therapy.

26654,What is the most cost-effective population-based cancer screening program for Chinese women?,"PURPOSE: To develop a policy-relevant generalized cost-effectiveness (CE) model of population-based cancer screening for Chinese women. METHODS: Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and associated screening and treatment costs under population-based screening using cervical cytology (cervical cancer), mammography (breast cancer), and fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy (colorectal cancer) were estimated, from which average and incremental CE ratios were generated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess stochasticity, parameter uncertainty, and model assumptions. RESULTS: Cervical, breast, and colorectal cancers were together responsible for 13,556 DALYs (in a 1:4:3 ratio, respectively) in Hong Kong's 3.4 million female population annually. All status quo strategies were dominated, thus confirming the suboptimal efficiency of opportunistic screening. Current patterns of screening averted 471 DALYs every year, which could potentially be more than doubled to 1,161 DALYs under the same screening and treatment budgetary threshold of US $50 million with 100% Pap coverage every 4 years and 30% coverage of colonoscopy every 10 years. With higher budgetary caps, biennial mammographic screening starting at age 50 years can be introduced.

METHODS: Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted and associated screening and treatment costs under population-based screening using cervical cytology (cervical cancer), mammography (breast cancer), and fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, FOBT plus sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy (colorectal cancer) were estimated, from which average and incremental CE ratios were generated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess stochasticity, parameter uncertainty, and model assumptions. RESULTS: Cervical, breast, and colorectal cancers were together responsible for 13,556 DALYs (in a 1:4:3 ratio, respectively) in Hong Kong's 3.4 million female population annually.

Policymakers need information about the projected health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of vaccination when considering these investments. Our aim was to incorporate these data into an economic analysis of pneumococcal vaccination of infants in countries eligible for financial support from the Global Alliance for Vaccines & Immunization (GAVI). METHODS: We constructed a decision analysis model to compare pneumococcal vaccination of infants aged 6, 10, and 14 weeks with no vaccination in the 72 countries that were eligible as of 2005. We used published and unpublished data to estimate child mortality, effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and immunisation rates. FINDINGS: Pneumococcal vaccination at the rate of diptheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine coverage was projected to prevent 262,000 deaths per year (7%) in children aged 3-29 months in the 72 developing countries studied, thus averting 8.34 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) yearly.

26664,"Treating cutaneous leishmaniasis patients in Kabul, Afghanistan: cost-effectiveness of an operational program in a complex emergency setting","BACKGROUND: Although Kabul city, Afghanistan, is currently the worldwide largest focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) with an estimated 67,500 cases, donor interest in CL has been comparatively poor because the disease is non-fatal. Since 1998 HealthNet TPO (HNTPO) has implemented leishmaniasis diagnosis and treatment services in Kabul and in 2003 alone 16,390 were treated patients in six health clinics in and around the city. The aim of our study was to calculate the cost-effectiveness for the implemented treatment regimen of CL patients attending HNTPO clinics in the Afghan complex emergency setting. METHODS: Using clinical and cost data from the on-going operational HNTPO program in Kabul, published and unpublished sources, and discussions with researchers, we developed models that included probabilistic sensitivity analysis to calculate ranges for the cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted for implemented CL treatment regimen. We calculated the cost-effectiveness of intralesional and intramuscular administration of the pentavalent antimonial drug sodium stibogluconate, HNTPO's current CL 'standard treatment'. RESULTS: The cost of the standard treatment was calculated to be 27 US dollars (95% C.I. 20-36) per patient treated and cured. The cost per DALY averted per patient cured with the standard treatment was estimated to be approximately 1,200 US dollars (761-1,827). CONCLUSION: According to WHO-CHOICE criteria, treatment of CL in Kabul, Afghanistan, is not a cost-effective health intervention.

26665,The cost-effectiveness of DOTS in urban Brazil,"SETTING: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a middle-income setting with an estimated 1% adult human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of DOTS in Rio de Janeiro. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on cost data and an epidemiological model based on programmatic outcomes from the Health Department in Rio de Janeiro, cost data from the retail market sector and epidemiological data from published studies. RESULTS: The 10-year cost of a tuberculosis program treating a population of 262 000 based on self-administered therapy (SAT) was estimated to be $580 271 compared to $1047 886 for DOTS. The largest portion of the DOTS budget was for staff costs and costs incurred by patients, both at 28%. For SAT, the largest percentage of the budget was allocated to medication costs, at 34%. Upgrading from SAT to DOTS averted 1558 cases of tuberculosis (TB, uncertainty range [UR] 1418-1704) and 143 TB deaths (UR 131-155). The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for DOTS was $300 per case averted (UR $289-$312) and $3270 per death averted (UR $3123-$3435). In terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), DOTS saved 5426 DALYs (UR 4908-5961). The ICER for DOTS was $86 per DALY saved (UR $74-$100).

The burden of disease, expressed in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and the corresponding cost-of-illness, were estimated using data from epidemiological studies. With the help of a risk assessment model, the reduction in the incidence of Campylobacter infections due to a set of possible interventions in the broiler meat (chicken) chain was modeled. Separately, costs related to the implementation of these interventions in the broiler meat chain were estimated. For each intervention to be modeled, the net costs of an interventionadditional costs in the broiler meat chain minus reduced cost-of-illness-were related to the reduced burden of disease.

26669,Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: the incremental cost-effectiveness of a new delivery system in Uganda,"The main objective of this study was to assess whether traditional birth attendants, drug-shop vendors, community reproductive health workers and adolescent peer mobilisers could administer intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to pregnant women. The study was implemented in 21 community clusters (intervention) and four clusters where health centres provided routine IPTp (control). The primary outcome measures were the proportion of women who completed two doses of SP; the effect on anaemia, parasitaemia and low birth weight; and the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention. The study enrolled 2785 pregnant women. The majority, 1404/2081 (67.5%) receiving community-based care, received SP early and adhered to the two recommended doses compared with 281/704 (39.9%) at health centres (P<0.001). In addition, women receiving community-based care had fewer episodes of anaemia or severe anaemia and fewer low birth weight babies. The cost per woman receiving the full course of IPTp was, however, higher when delivered via community care at US$2.60 compared with US$2.30 at health centres, due to the additional training costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the community delivery system was Uganda shillings 1869 (US$1.10) per lost disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. In conclusion, community-based delivery increased access and adherence to IPTp and was cost-effective.",2008-99-03676,18513767,Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg,A K Mbonye,2008,102 / 7,685-93,No,18513767,"A K Mbonye; K S Hansen; I C Bygbjerg; P Magnussen; K S Hansen; I C Bygbjerg; P Magnussen; Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy: the incremental cost-effectiveness of a new delivery system in Uganda, Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg, 2008-Jul; 102(7):0035-9203; 685-93",DALY,Uganda,Not Stated,Care Delivery,Giving intermittent preventive treatment (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) to pregnant women (community based delivery) vs. Giving IPTp + SP to pregnant women in four clusters where health centres provided routine IPTp (health center based delivery),Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,,10.00,3.00,1869,Uganda,2006,1.38

26674,Alveolar echinococcosis: from a deadly disease to a well-controlled infection. Relative survival and economic analysis in Switzerland over the last 35 years,"BACKGROUND/AIMS: Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a serious liver disease. The aim of this study was to explore the long-term prognosis of AE patients, the burden of this disease in Switzerland and the cost-effectiveness of treatment. METHODS: Relative survival analysis was undertaken using a national database with 329 patient records. 155 representative cases had sufficient details regarding treatment costs and patient outcome to estimate the financial implications and treatment costs of AE. RESULTS: For an average 54-year-old patient diagnosed with AE in 1970 the life expectancy was estimated to be reduced by 18.2 and 21.3 years for men and women, respectively. By 2005 this was reduced to approximately 3.5 and 2.6 years, respectively. Patients undergoing radical surgery had a better outcome, whereas the older patients had a poorer prognosis than the younger patients. Costs amount to approximately Euro108,762 per patient. Assuming the improved life expectancy of AE patients is due to modern treatment the cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALY) saved is approximately Euro6,032. CONCLUSIONS: Current treatments have substantially improved the prognosis of AE patients compared to the 1970s. The cost per DALY saved is low compared to the average national annual income. Hence, AE treatment is highly cost-effective in Switzerland.",2008-99-03733,18485517,J Hepatol,Paul R Torgerson,2008,49 / 1,72-7,No,18485517,"Paul R Torgerson; Alexander Schweiger; Peter Deplazes; Maja Pohar; Jürg Reichen; Rudolf W Ammann; Philip E Tarr; Nerman Halkik; Beat Müllhaupt; Alexander Schweiger; Peter Deplazes; Maja Pohar; Jürg Reichen; Rudolf W Ammann; Philip E Tarr; Nerman Halkik; Beat Müllhaupt; Alveolar echinococcosis: from a deadly disease to a well-controlled infection.

26675,Cost-effectiveness analysis of insecticide-treated net distribution as part of the Togo Integrated Child Health Campaign,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the first nationwide delivery of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLITNs) as part of the 2004 measles vaccination campaign in Togo to all children between nine months and five years. METHODS: An incremental approach was used to calculate the economic costs and effects from a provider perspective. Effectiveness was estimated in terms of malaria cases averted, deaths averted and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted. Malaria cases were modelled using regional estimates. Programme and treatment costs were derived through reviews of financial records and interviews with key stakeholders. Uncertain variables were subjected to a univariate sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Assuming equal attribution of shared costs between the LLITN distribution and the measles vaccination, the net costs per LLITN distributed were 4.41 USD when saved treatment costs were taken into account. Assuming a constant utilization of LLITNs by the target group over three years, 1.2 million cases could be prevented at a net cost per case averted of 3.26 USD. The net costs were 635 USD per death averted and 16.39 USD per DALY averted, respectively. CONCLUSION: The costs per case, death and DALY averted are well within commonly agreed benchmarks set by other malaria prevention studies. Varying transmission levels are shown to have a significant impact on cost-effectiveness ratios.

We estimated total vaccine-preventable disease burden and the cost-effectiveness of Hib conjugate vaccine in Indonesia. METHODS: Hib pneumonia and meningitis incidences for children with access to health care were derived from a randomized vaccine probe study on Lombok Island, Indonesia during 1998-2002. Incidences were adjusted for limited access to care. Health system and patient out-of-pocket treatment cost data were collected concurrent with the probe study. For Hib vaccine in monovalent and combined (with DTP-HepB) presentations, we used 2007 UNICEF vaccine prices of US$3.30 and $3.75 per dose. RESULTS: For the 2007 Indonesian birth cohort, Hib vaccine would prevent meningitis in 1 of every 179 children, pneumonia in 1 of every 18 children, and 4.9% of mortality among those younger than 5 years. The total incremental societal costs of introducing Hib vaccine in monovalent and pentavalent presentations were, respectively, US$11.74 and $8.93 per child vaccinated. Annual discounted treatment costs averted amounted to 20% of pentavalent vaccine costs. For the pentavalent vaccine, the incremental costs per discounted death and disability adjusted life-year averted amounted to US$3102 and $74, respectively, versus $4438 and $102 for monovalent vaccine.

26678,The cost-effectiveness of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected children in Zambia,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected children in Zambia, as implementation at the local health centre level has yet to be undertaken in many resource-limited countries despite recommendations in recent updated World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. DESIGN: A probabilistic decision analytical model of HIV/AIDS progression in children based on the CD4 cell percentage (CD4%) was populated with data from the placebo-controlled Children with HIV Antibiotic Prophylaxis trial that had reported a 43% reduction in mortality with cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected children aged 1-14 years. METHODS: Unit costs (US$ in 2006) were measured at University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka. Cost-effectiveness expressed as cost per life-year saved, cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, cost per disability adjusted life-year (DALY) averted was calculated across a number of different scenarios at tertiary and primary healthcare centres. RESULTS:: Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of US$72 per life-year saved, US$94 per QALY saved and US$53 per DALY averted, i.e. substantially less than a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$1019 per outcome (gross domestic product per capita, Zambia 2006). ICERs of US$5 or less per outcome demonstrate that cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is even more cost-effective at the local healthcare level. The intervention remained cost-effective in all sensitivity analyses including routine haematological and CD4% monitoring, varying starting age, AIDS status, cotrimoxazole formulation, efficacy duration and discount rates. CONCLUSION: Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected children is an inexpensive low technology intervention that is highly cost-effective in Zambia, strongly supporting the adoption of WHO guidelines into essential healthcare packages in low-income countries.",2008-01-03914,18356605,AIDS,Máirín Ryan,2008,26 / 13,749-57,No,18356605,"Máirín Ryan; Susan Griffin; Bona Chitah; A Sarah Walker; Veronica Mulenga; Donald Kalolo; Neil Hawkins; Concepta Merry; Michael G Barry; Chifumbe Chintu; Mark J Sculpher; Diana M Gibb; The cost-effectiveness of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected children in Zambia, AIDS, ; 26(13):0269-9370; 749-57",DALY,Zambia,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,18 Years,6 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,53,United States,2006,68.04

26680,Iron and zinc deficiencies in China: what is a feasible and cost-effective strategy?,"In order to prioritise interventions for micronutrient deficiencies in China, the populations affected by iron and zinc deficiencies were assessed based on data from the 2002 China National Nutrition and Health Survey. The costs and cost-effectiveness of supplementation, food diversification and food fortification were estimated using the standard World Health Organization ingredients approach. Results indicated that 30% of children (60 years), pregnant and lactating women, and 20% of women of reproductive age were anaemic, some 245 million people. Approximately 100 million people were affected by zinc deficiency (zinc intake inadequacy and stunting), the majority living in rural areas. Among interventions on iron and zinc deficiency, biofortification showed the lowest costs per capita, I$0.01 (international dollars), while dietary diversification through health education represented the highest costs at I$1148. The cost-effectiveness of supplementation, food fortification and dietary diversification for iron deficiency alone was I$179, I$66 and I$103 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), respectively. Data for biofortification were not available. For zinc deficiency, the corresponding figures were I$399, I$153 and I$103 per DALY, respectively.

The costs and cost-effectiveness of supplementation, food diversification and food fortification were estimated using the standard World Health Organization ingredients approach. Results indicated that 30% of children (60 years), pregnant and lactating women, and 20% of women of reproductive age were anaemic, some 245 million people. Approximately 100 million people were affected by zinc deficiency (zinc intake inadequacy and stunting), the majority living in rural areas. Among interventions on iron and zinc deficiency, biofortification showed the lowest costs per capita, I$0.01 (international dollars), while dietary diversification through health education represented the highest costs at I$1148. The cost-effectiveness of supplementation, food fortification and dietary diversification for iron deficiency alone was I$179, I$66 and I$103 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY), respectively.

Given a maximum acceptable willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of 300,000 Baht/DALY averted starting with EFZ-based regimens was cost-effective for patients with a baseline CD4 count less than 250 cells/mm3 and in all patient age groups, except those who were 20 years old.The results suggest that starting with EFZ-based regimens was the preferable choice and it should be used as the first line regimen for Thai HIV/AIDS patients.",2008-99-13342,19253494,J Med Assoc Thai,Usawadee Maleewong,2008,91 Suppl 2 /,S126-38,No,19253494,"Usawadee Maleewong; Vithaya Kulsomboon; Yot Teerawattananon; The cost-effectiveness analysis of initiating HIV/AIDS treatment with efavirenz-based regimens compared with nevirapine-based regimens in Thailand, J Med Assoc Thai, ; 91 Suppl 2():0125-2208; S126-38",DALY,Thailand,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Efavirenz-based regimens vs. Nevirapine-based regimens,"Baseline CD4 count 250 cell/mm^3, age at baseline treatment 38 years",Not Stated,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,Thailand,2006,Not Stated
26696,Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in Latin America and the Caribbean: a regional analysis,"OBJECTIVE: In Latin America and the Caribbean, routine vaccination of infants against Streptococcus pneumoniae would need substantial investment by governments and donor organizations. Policymakers need information about the projected health benefits, costs, and cost-effectiveness of vaccination when considering these investments. Our aim was to incorporate vaccine, demographic, epidemiologic, and cost data into an economic analysis of pneumococcal vaccination of infants in Latin America and the Caribbean. METHODS: We previously used a structured literature review to develop regional estimates of the incidence of disease. Cost data were collected from physician interviews and public fee schedules. We then constructed a decision analytic model to compare pneumococcal conjugate vaccination of infants with no vaccination across this region, examining only vaccine's direct effects on children. RESULTS: Pneumococcal vaccination at the rate of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine coverage was projected to prevent 9 500 deaths per year in children aged 0 to 5 years in the region, or approximately one life saved per 1 100 infants vaccinated. These saved lives as well as averted cases of deafness, motor deficit, and seizure result in 321 000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) being averted annually. At vaccine prices between US$5 and US$53 per dose, the cost per DALY averted from a societal perspective would range from US$154 to US$5 252. CONCLUSION: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was highly cost-effective up to $40 per dose. Introduction of pneumococcal vaccine in the Latin American and Caribbean region is projected to reduce childhood mortality and to be highly cost-effective across a range of possible costs.",2008-XX-04238,19141172,Rev Panam Salud Publica,Anushua Sinha,2009,24 / 5,304-13,No,19141172,"Anushua Sinha; Dagna Constenla; Juan Esteban Valencia; Rosalyn O'Loughlin; Elizabeth Gomez; Fernando de la Hoz; Maria Teresa Valenzuela; Ciro A de Quadros; Cost-effectiveness of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination in Latin America and the Caribbean: a regional analysis, Rev Panam Salud Publica, 2008-Nov; 24(5):1020-4989; 304-13",DALY,"Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Cayman Islands, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Puerto Rico, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos Islands, Uruguay, Venezuela, Virgin Islands of the United States",Not Stated,"Immunization, Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care",Pneumococcal conjugate vaccination vs. None,Latin America and Caribbean region (see methods for full list of countries),5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,154,United States,2005,204.08
26697,Impact and cost-effectiveness of culture for diagnosis of tuberculosis in HIV-infected Brazilian adults,"BACKGROUND: Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis currently represents the closest ""gold standard"" for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), but operational data are scant on the impact and cost-effectiveness of TB culture for human immunodeficiency (HIV-) infected individuals in resource-limited settings. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recorded costs, laboratory results, and dates of initiating TB therapy in a centralized TB culture program for HIV-infected patients in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, constructing a decision-analysis model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of TB culture from the perspective of a public-sector TB control program. Of 217 TB suspects presenting between January 2006 and March 2008, 33 (15%) had culture-confirmed active tuberculosis; 23 (70%) were smear-negative. Among smear-negative, culture-positive patients, 6 (26%) began TB therapy before culture results were available, 11 (48%) began TB therapy after culture result availability, and 6 (26%) did not begin TB therapy within 180 days of presentation. The cost per negative culture was US$17.52 (solid media)-$23.50 (liquid media). Per 1,000 TB suspects and compared with smear alone, TB culture with solid media would avert an estimated eight TB deaths (95% simulation interval [SI]: 4, 15) and 37 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (95% SI: 13, 76), at a cost of $36 (95% SI: $25, $50) per TB suspect or $962 (95% SI: $469, $2642) per DALY averted. Replacing solid media with automated liquid culture would avert one further death (95% SI: -1, 4) and eight DALYs (95% SI: -4, 23) at $2751 per DALY (95% SI: $680, dominated). The cost-effectiveness of TB culture was more sensitive to characteristics of the existing TB diagnostic system than to the accuracy or cost of TB culture. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: TB culture is potentially effective and cost-effective for HIV-positive patients in resource-constrained settings.
