24101,Estimating the price at which hepatitis C treatment with direct-acting antivirals would be cost-saving in Japan,"In Japan, 1.5-2 million people are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. New direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) offer an unprecedented opportunity to cure HCV. While the price of HCV treatment decreased recently in most countries, it remains one of the highest in Japan. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCV treatment in patients of different age groups and to estimate the price at which DAAs become cost-saving in Japan. A previously developed microsimulation model was adapted to the Japanese population and updated with Japan-specific health utilities and costs. Our model showed that compared with no treatment, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of DAAs at a price USD 41,046 per treatment was USD 9,080 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 60-year-old patients. HCV treatment became cost-effective after 9 years of starting treatment. However, if the price of DAAs is reduced by 55-85% (USD 6,730 to 17,720), HCV treatment would be cost-saving within a 5 to 20-year time horizon, which should serve to increase the uptake of DAA-based HCV treatment. The payers of health care in Japan could examine ways to procure DAAs at a price where they would be cost-saving.",2020-01-33844,0,Sci Rep,Y Zhuo,2020,10 /,4089,No,Not Stated,"Y Zhuo; T Hayashi; Q Chen; R Aggarwal; Y Hutin; J Chhatwal; Estimating the price at which hepatitis C treatment with direct-acting antivirals would be cost-saving in Japan, Sci Rep, 2020; 10():2045-2322; 4089",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,direct acting antiviral vs. None,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,"Lifetime, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years",2.00,2.00,9080,Japan,2018,84.77

24105,Cost Effectiveness of Latest Recommendations for Group B Streptococci Screening in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether group B streptococci (GBS) screening using the 2010 guideline (screening at 35 0/7-37 6/7 weeks of gestation) compared with the 2019 guideline (screening at 36 0/7-37 6/7 weeks of gestation with re-screening of women with GBS-negative results 5 weeks later) was more cost effective. METHODS: We constructed a decision-analysis model to compare the outcome of GBS early-onset disease in a hypothetical cohort of 3,614,049 women at 35 0/7 weeks of gestation or greater (the number of live births in 2017 excluding births based on population frequency from 23 to 34 weeks of gestation, women with GBS bacteriuria during the current pregnancy, and those with a history of a previous neonate with GBS disease). We took both a health care and societal perspective and all costs were expressed in 2017 U.S. dollars. Effectiveness was based on neonatal quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated with a willingness to pay threshold set at $100,000/QALY. All model inputs were derived from the literature. One-way probability and cost sensitivity analysis were performed to investigate model assumptions. RESULTS: Screening at 36 0/7-37 6/7 weeks of gestation with re-screening of women with GBS-negative results if 5 weeks passed from culture to delivery resulted in a 6% increase in neonatal QALYs gained (2,162 vs 2,037), 12% fewer cases of neonatal death (30 vs 34), and a 10% estimated reduction in total societal health care expenditures related to GBS early-onset disease ($639 million vs $707 million) when compared with the 2010 strategy of only screening at 35 0/7-37 6/7 weeks of gestation. The 2019 approach was cost effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $43,205 per neonatal QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Screening at 36 0/7-37 6/7 weeks of gestation with a 5-week re-screening for women with GBS-negative results is more cost effective than past strategies used in the United States.",2020-01-33860,0,Obstet Gynecol,M Williams,2020,135 /,789-798,No,Not Stated,"M Williams; E Zantow; M Turrentine; Cost Effectiveness of Latest Recommendations for Group B Streptococci Screening in the United States, Obstet Gynecol, 2020; 135():0029-7844; 789-798",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Screening,"screening at 35 0/7â€“37 6/7 weeks of gestation and re-screening 5 weeks later vs. Standard/Usual Care- standard care of group b streptococcus infection, no prevention",Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,43205,United States,2017,45618.18
24106,Cost-effectiveness of Mifepristone Pretreatment for the Medical Management of Nonviable Early Pregnancy: Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial,"Importance: Early pregnancy loss (EPL) is the most common complication of pregnancy. A multicenter randomized clinical trial compared 2 strategies for medical management and found that mifepristone pretreatment is 25% more effective than the standard of care, misoprostol alone. The cost of mifepristone may be a barrier to implementation of the regimen. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of medical management of EPL with mifepristone pretreatment plus misoprostol vs misoprostol alone in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This preplanned. prospective economic evaluation was performed concurrently with a randomized clinical trial in 3 US sites from May 1, 2014, through April 30, 2017. Participants included 300 women with anembryonic gestation or embryonic or fetal demise. Cost-effectiveness was computed from the health care sector and societal perspectives, with a 30-day time horizon. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2018, to July 3, 2019. Interventions: Mifepristone pretreatment plus misoprostol administration vs misoprostol alone. Main Outcomes and Measures: Costs in 2018 US dollars, effectiveness in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and treatment efficacy. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of mifepristone and misoprostol vs misoprostol alone were calculated, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were generated. Results: Among the 300 women included in the randomized clinical trial (mean [SD] age, 30.4 [6.2] years), mean costs were similar for groups receiving mifepristone pretreatment and misoprostol alone from the health care sector perspective ($696.75 [95% CI, $591.88-$801.62] vs $690.88 [95% CI, $562.38-$819.38]; P = .94) and the societal perspective ($3846.30 [95% CI, $2783.01-$4909.58] vs $4845.62 [95% CI, $3186.84-$6504.41]; P = .32). The mifepristone pretreatment group had higher QALYs (0.0820 [95% CI, 0.0815-0.0825] vs 0.0806 [95% CI, 0.0800-0.0812]; P = .001) and a higher completion rate after first treatment (83.8% vs 67.1%; P < .001) than the group receiving misoprostol alone. From the health care sector perspective, mifepristone pretreatment was cost-effective relative to misoprostol alone with an ICER of $4225.43 (95% CI, -$195 053.30 to $367 625.10) per QALY gained. From the societal perspective, mifepristone pretreatment dominated misoprostol alone (95% CI, -$5111629 to $1801384). The probabilities that mifepristone pretreatment was cost-effective compared with misoprostol alone at a willingness-to-pay of $150000 per QALY gained from the health care sector and societal perspectives were approximately 90% and 80%, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that medical management of EPL with mifepristone pretreatment was cost-effective when compared with misoprostol alone.

24108,Cost-effectiveness Evaluation of Targeted Surgical and Endoscopic Therapies for Early Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Based on Biomarker Profiles,"Importance: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. The prognosis for patients with CRC varies widely, but new prognostic biomarkers provide the opportunity to implement a more individualized approach to treatment selection. Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 3 therapeutic strategies, namely, endoscopic therapy (ET), laparoscopic colectomy (LC), and open colectomy (OC), for patients with T1 CRC with biomarker profiles that prognosticate varying levels of tumor progression in the US payer perspective. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic evaluation study, a Markov model was developed for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Risks of all-cause mortality and recurrent cancer after ET, LC, or OC were estimated with a 35-year time horizon. Quality of life was based on EuroQoL 5 Dimensions scores reported in the published literature. Hospital and treatment costs reflected Medicare reimbursement rates. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Data from patients with T1 CRC and 6 biomarker profiles that included adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), TP53 and/or KRAS, or BRAFV600E were used as inputs for the model. Data analyses were conducted from February 27, 2019, to May 13, 2019. Exposures: Endoscopic therapy, LC, and OC. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were unadjusted life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between competing treatment strategies. Results: Endoscopic therapy had the highest QALYs and the lowest cost and was the dominant treatment strategy for T1 CRC with the following biomarker profiles: BRAFV600E, APC(1)/KRAS/TP53, APC(2) or APC(2)/KRAS or APC(2)/TP53, or APC(1) or APC(1)/KRAS or APC(1)/TP53. The QALYs gained ranged from 16.97 to 17.22, with costs between $68902.75 and $77784.53 in these subgroups. For the 2 more aggressive biomarker profiles with worse prognoses (APC(2)/KRAS/TP53 and APCwt [wild type]), LC was the most effective strategy (with 16.45 and 16.61 QALYs gained, respectively) but was not cost-effective. Laparoscopic colectomy cost $65234.87 for APC(2)/KRAS/TP53 and $71250.56 for APCwt, resulting in ICERs of $113290 per QALY and $178765 per QALY, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This modeling analysis found that ET was the most effective strategy for patients with T1 CRC with less aggressive biomarker profiles. For patients with more aggressive profiles, LC was more effective but was costly, rendering ET the cost-effective option.

Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 3 therapeutic strategies, namely, endoscopic therapy (ET), laparoscopic colectomy (LC), and open colectomy (OC), for patients with T1 CRC with biomarker profiles that prognosticate varying levels of tumor progression in the US payer perspective. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this economic evaluation study, a Markov model was developed for the cost-effectiveness analysis. Risks of all-cause mortality and recurrent cancer after ET, LC, or OC were estimated with a 35-year time horizon. Quality of life was based on EuroQoL 5 Dimensions scores reported in the published literature. Hospital and treatment costs reflected Medicare reimbursement rates. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. Data from patients with T1 CRC and 6 biomarker profiles that included adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), TP53 and/or KRAS, or BRAFV600E were used as inputs for the model. Data analyses were conducted from February 27, 2019, to May 13, 2019. Exposures: Endoscopic therapy, LC, and OC. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were unadjusted life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between competing treatment strategies. Results: Endoscopic therapy had the highest QALYs and the lowest cost and was the dominant treatment strategy for T1 CRC with the following biomarker profiles: BRAFV600E, APC(1)/KRAS/TP53, APC(2) or APC(2)/KRAS or APC(2)/TP53, or APC(1) or APC(1)/KRAS or APC(1)/TP53. The QALYs gained ranged from 16.97 to 17.22, with costs between $68902.75 and $77784.53 in these subgroups. For the 2 more aggressive biomarker profiles with worse prognoses (APC(2)/KRAS/TP53 and APCwt [wild type]), LC was the most effective strategy (with 16.45 and 16.61 QALYs gained, respectively) but was not cost-effective. Laparoscopic colectomy cost $65234.87 for APC(2)/KRAS/TP53 and $71250.56 for APCwt, resulting in ICERs of $113290 per QALY and $178765 per QALY, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This modeling analysis found that ET was the most effective strategy for patients with T1 CRC with less aggressive biomarker profiles. For patients with more aggressive profiles, LC was more effective but was costly, rendering ET the cost-effective option.

Laparoscopic colectomy cost $65234.87 for APC(2)/KRAS/TP53 and $71250.56 for APCwt, resulting in ICERs of $113290 per QALY and $178765 per QALY, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This modeling analysis found that ET was the most effective strategy for patients with T1 CRC with less aggressive biomarker profiles. For patients with more aggressive profiles, LC was more effective but was costly, rendering ET the cost-effective option. This study highlights the potential utility of prognostic biomarkers in T1 CRC treatment selection.",2020-01-33865,0,Oncol.

24120,Cost-Effectiveness of a Multifaceted Quality Improvement Intervention for Acute Ischemic Stroke in China,"Background and Purpose - Multifaceted quality improvement interventions of stroke care have been shown to improve hospital personnel adherence to evidence-based performance measures and subsequent stroke outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted quality improvement intervention for stroke care in China, the world''s largest low- and middle-income country. Methods- A short-term decision tree model and a long-term Markov model were used to analyze the cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted quality improvement intervention for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Outcomes, transition probability, and cost data were obtained from a recent clinical trial and the published literature. The benefit of the intervention was assessed by the costs per quality-adjusted life-years gained in the short- and long-term. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the uncertainty of the findings. Results - Compared with usual care, a multifaceted quality improvement intervention for stroke care was found to be cost-effective in the first year and highly cost-effective from the second year onward. In the long-term, the intervention yielded a lifetime gain of 0.246 quality-adjusted life-years at an additional cost of Chinese Yuan Renminbi 1510 (US $230), resulting in a cost of Chinese Yuan Renminbi 6138 (US $940) per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the intervention was highly cost-effective in 99.9% of the simulation runs at a willingness-to-pay threshold of Chinese Yuan Renminbi 59 700 (1x gross domestic product per capita of China in 2017, US $9200) per quality-adjusted life-year.

24123,Cost-effectiveness of the hospital nutrition screening tool CIPA,"Introduction: Hospital malnutrition is very common and worsens the clinical course of patients while increasing costs. Lacking clinical-economic studies on the implementation of nutrition screening encouraged the evaluation of the CIPA (Control of Food Intake, Protein, Anthropometry) tool. Material and methods: An open, non-randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted on patients admitted to internal medicine and general and digestive surgery wards, who were either assigned to a control (standard hospital clinical care) or to an intervention, CIPA-performing ward (412 and 411, respectively; n = 823). Length of stay, mortality, readmission, in-hospital complications, and quality of life were evaluated. Cost-effectiveness was analysed in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Results: The mean length of stay was higher in the CIPA group, though not significantly (+ 0.95 days; p = 0.230). On the surgical ward, more patients from the control group moved to critical care units (p = 0.014); the other clinical variables did not vary. Quality of life at discharge was similar (p = 0.53), although slightly higher in the CIPA group at 3 months (p = 0.089). Patients under CIPA screening had a higher mean cost of 691.6 and a mean QALY gain over a 3-month period of 0.0042. While the cost per QALY for the internal medicine patients was 642 282, the results for surgical patients suggest that the screening tool is both less costly and more effective.

24128,Cost-effectiveness of Using Kidneys From HCV-Viremic Donors for Transplantation Into HCV-Uninfected Recipients,"RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Less than 4% of patients with kidney failure receive kidney transplants. Although discard rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV)-viremic kidneys are declining, ~39% of HCV-viremic kidneys donated between 2018 and 2019 were discarded. Highly effective antiviral agents are now available to treat chronic HCV infection. Thus, our objective was to examine the cost-effectiveness of transplanting kidneys from HCV-viremic donors into HCV-uninfected recipients. STUDY DESIGN: Markov state transition decision model. Data sources include Medline search results, bibliographies from relevant English language articles, Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, and the US Renal Data System. SETTING & POPULATION: US patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis who are on kidney transplant waiting lists. INTERVENTION(S): Transplantation with an HCV-unexposed kidney versus transplantation with an HCV-viremic kidney and HCV treatment. OUTCOMES: Effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life-years and costs measured in 2018 US dollars. MODEL, PERSPECTIVE, AND TIMEFRAME: We used a health care system perspective with a lifelong time horizon. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, transplantation with an HCV-viremic kidney was more effective and less costly than transplantation with an HCV-unexposed kidney because of the longer waiting times for HCV-unexposed kidneys, the substantial excess mortality risk while receiving dialysis, and the high efficacy of direct-acting antiviral agents for HCV infection. Transplantation with an HCV-viremic kidney was also preferred in sensitivity analyses of multiple model parameters. The strategy remained cost-effective unless waiting list time for an HCV-viremic kidney exceeded 3.1 years compared with the base-case value of 1.56 year. LIMITATIONS: Estimates of waiting times for patients willing to accept an HCV-viremic kidney were based on data for patients who received HCV-viremic kidney transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Transplanting kidneys from HCV-viremic donors into HCV-uninfected recipients increased quality-adjusted life expectancy and reduced costs compared with a strategy of transplanting kidneys from HCV-unexposed donors.

24130,Cost-effectiveness of an environmental cleaning bundle for reducing healthcare-associated infections,"Background. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remain a significant patient safety issue, with point prevalence estimates being ~5% in high-income countries. In 2016-2017, the Researching Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals (REACH) study implemented an environmental cleaning bundle targeting communication, staff training, improved cleaning technique, product use, and audit of frequent touch-point cleaning. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the environmental cleaning bundle for reducing the incidence of HAIs. Methods. A stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized trial was conducted in 11 hospitals recruited from 6 Australian states and territories. Bundle effectiveness was measured by the numbers of Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci infections prevented in the intervention phase based on estimated reductions in the relative risk of infection. Changes to costs were defined as the cost of implementing the bundle minus cost savings from fewer infections. Health benefits gained from fewer infections were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and net monetary benefit of adopting the cleaning bundle over existing hospital cleaning practices. Results. Implementing the cleaning bundle cost $349 000 Australian dollars (AUD) and generated AUD$147 500 in cost savings. Infections prevented under the cleaning bundle returned a net monetary benefit of AUD$1.02 million and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $4684 per QALY gained. There was an 86% chance that the bundle was cost-effective compared with existing hospital cleaning practices. Conclusions.

24131,Cost-effectiveness of direct antiviral agents for hepatitis C virus infection and a combined intervention of syringe access and medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorders in an injection drug use population,"Background. There are too many plausible permutations and scale-up scenarios of combination hepatitis C virus (HCV) interventions for exhaustive testing in experimental trials. Therefore, we used a computer simulation to project the health and economic impacts of alternative combination intervention scenarios for people who inject drugs (PWID), focusing on direct antiviral agents (DAA) and medication-assisted treatment combined with syringe access programs (MAT+). Methods. We performed an allocative efficiency study, using a mathematical model to simulate the progression of HCV in PWID and its related consequences. We combined 2 previously validated simulations to estimate the cost-effectiveness of intervention strategies that included a range of coverage levels. Analyses were performed from a health-sector and societal perspective, with a 15-year time horizon and a discount rate of 3%. Results. From a health-sector perspective (excluding criminal justice systemâ€“related costs), 4 potential strategies fell on the cost-efficiency frontier.

Social anxiety is one of the most common sources of mental distress in the population, and many people with symptoms do not seek help for what represents a significant public health problem. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a self-guided cognitive behavioral internet intervention for people with social anxiety symptoms in the general population. Methods: We conducted a two-group randomized controlled trial in England between May 11, 2016, and June 27, 2018. Adults with social anxiety symptoms who were not receiving treatment for social anxiety were recruited using online advertisements. All participants had unrestricted access to usual care and were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either a Web-based unguided self-help intervention based on cognitive behavioral principles or a waiting list control group. All outcomes were collected through self-report online questionnaires. The primary outcome was the change in 17-item Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN-17) score from baseline to 6 weeks using a linear mixed-effect model that used data from all time points (6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). Results: A total of 2122 participants were randomized, and 6 were excluded from analyses because they were ineligible. Of the 2116 eligible randomized participants (mean age 37 years; 80.24%, 1698/2116 women), 70.13% (1484/2116) had follow-up data available for analysis, and 56.95% (1205/2116) had data on the primary outcome, although attrition was higher in the intervention arm. At 6 weeks, the mean (95% CI) adjusted difference in change in SPIN-17 score in the intervention group compared with control was -1.94 (-3.13 to -0.75; P=.001), a standardized mean difference effect size of 0.2. The improvement was maintained at 12 months. Given the high dropout rate, sensitivity analyses explored missing data assumptions, with results that were consistent with those of the primary analysis. The economic evaluation demonstrated cost-effectiveness with a small health status benefit and a reduction in health service utilization. Conclusions: For people with social anxiety symptoms who are not receiving other forms of help, this study suggests that the use of an online self-help tool based on cognitive behavioral principles can provide a small improvement in social anxiety symptoms compared with no intervention, although dropout rates were high.",2020-01-33959,0,J Med Internet Res,Williams V.

24141,Cost-Effectiveness of Tenecteplase Before Thrombectomy for Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tenecteplase improved functional outcomes and reduced the requirement for endovascular thrombectomy in ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion in the EXTEND-IA TNK randomized trial. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of tenecteplase versus alteplase in this trial. METHODS: Post hoc within-trial economic analysis included costs of index emergency department and inpatient stroke hospitalization, rehabilitation/subacute care, and rehospitalization due to stroke within 90 days. Sources for cost included key study site complemented by published literature and government websites. Quality-adjusted life-years were estimated using utility scores derived from the modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. Long-term modeled cost-effectiveness analysis used a Markov model with 7 health states corresponding to 7 modified Rankin Scale scores. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Within the 202 patients in the randomized controlled trial, total cost was nonsignificantly lower in the tenecteplase-treated patients (40?997 Australian dollars [AUD]) compared with alteplase-treated patients (46?188 AUD) for the first 90 days(P=0.125). Tenecteplase was the dominant treatment strategy in the short term, with similar cost (5412 AUD [95% CI, -13?348 to 2523]; P=0.181) and higher benefits (0.099 quality-adjusted life-years [95% CI, 0.001-0.1967]; P=0.048), with a 97.4% probability of being cost-effective. In the long-term, tenecteplase was associated with less additional lifetime cost (96?357 versus 106?304 AUD) and greater benefits (quality-adjusted life-years, 7.77 versus 6.48), and had a 100% probability of being cost-effective. Both deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analyses yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Both within-trial and long-term economic analyses showed that tenecteplase was highly likely to be cost-effective for patients with acute stroke before thrombectomy. Recommending the use of tenecteplase over alteplase could lead to a cost saving to the healthcare system both in the short and long term. Registration: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

24142,Cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses of school-based obesity prevention program,"BACKGROUND: Economic evaluation of school-based obesity interventions could provide support for public health decision of obesity prevention. This study is to perform cost-utility and cost-benefit assessment of three school-based childhood obesity interventions including nutrition education intervention (NE), physical activity intervention (PA) and comprehensive intervention (both NE and PA, CNP) with secondary data analysis of one randomized controlled trial. METHODS: The standard cost-effectiveness analysis methods were employed from a societal perspective to the health outcome and costs that are attributable to the intervention. NE, PA and CNP were carried out separately for 2 semesters for childhood obesity interventions in primary schools. The additional quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) resulting from the interventions were measured as the health outcome. A cost-utility ratio (CUR) and A cost-benefit ratio (CBR) was calculated as the ratio of implementation costs to the total medical and productivity loss costs averted by the interventions. RESULTS: The CUR and CBR were Â¥11,505.9 ($1646.0) per QALY and Â¥1.2 benefit per Â¥1 cost respectively, and the net saving was Â¥73,659.6 ($10,537.9).

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of inpatient initiation of sacubitril-valsartan vs enalapril compared with no initiation or posthospitalization initiation of sacubitril-valsartan among stabilized patients with HFrEF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation included data on US patients with HFrEF who were eligible for sacubitril-valsartan treatment from December 8, 2009, to May 15, 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A 5-state Markov model with all-cause mortality, HF, and non-HF hospitalization probabilities was used. Quality of life was estimated using Euro-QoL EQ-5D scores. Hospitalization, long-term care, and medication costs for sacubitril-valsartan and enalapril were modeled with a discount rate of 3%. The base-case analysis included a lifetime horizon from a health care and societal perspective. RESULTS: Modeled patients were a mean (SD) age of 63.8 (11.5) years. Inpatient treatment with sacubitril-valsartan ($5628 per year) was associated with 62 fewer HF-related admissions per 1000 patients compared with outpatient initiation or 116 fewer HF-related admissions compared with continuation of enalapril treatment.

From a societal perspective, inpatient initiation was estimated to save $460 per year per patient compared with no initiation of sacubitril-valsartan and $813 per year per patient compared with initiation after hospitalization. In a budget analysis, inpatient initiation of sacubitril-valsartan was estimated to save up to $449 per person for 1 year or $2550 per person over 5 years compared with continuation of enalapril.

24148,Cost-effectiveness of Recurrent Dupuytren Contracture Treatment,"IMPORTANCE: Owing to its tendency to recur, Dupuytren contracture often requires multiple treatments, which places additional economic burden on health care. The likelihood of contracture recurrence varies not only with treatment but also with disease characteristics, such as contracture severity and location, but prior cost-effectiveness analyses of Dupuytren contracture treatments have not considered these patient-specific disease characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To identify the most cost-effective treatment regimen for patients with recurrent Dupuytren contracture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation was conducted with state-transition microsimulation modeling using data from published studies and Medicare. A simulated cohort of 10?000 individuals with Dupuytren contracture was created. Patients could transition yearly between the following health states: symptom-free, symptomatic, and death. Available treatments were collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection, percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA), and limited fasciectomy (LF); individuals randomly chose any treatment when symptomatic. Patients were limited to 3 rounds of treatment for a contracture affecting 1 joint, totaling 27 unique combinations. If the contracture recurred after 3 treatments, patients lived with the disease for the remainder of life. EXPOSURES: PNA, collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection, or LF. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs (in US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000 per quality-adjusted life-year was used to assess cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: For the base case scenario of a patient aged 60 years with recurrent, low-severity metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint contracture, repeated PNA treatment was the only cost-effective treatment (2 PNA treatments followed by LF vs 3 PNA treatments, ICER [Monte Carlo SE]: $212?647/QALY [$36?000/QALY]). For recurrent high-severity MCP joint contractures, treatment regimens composed of PNA and LF were cost-effective (ICER [Monte Carlo SE], $93?932/QALY [$16?500/QALY]). LF was cost-effective for high-severity MCP joint contracture (ICER [Monte Carlo SE], $98?624/QALY [$26?233/QALY]). For recurrent proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contractures, PNA was the only cost-effective treatment, regardless of severity (eg, 2 PNA treatments followed by LF vs 3 PNA treatments for low-severity PIP joint contracture, ICER [Monte Carlo SE]: $263?726/QALY [$29?000/QALY]). Any combination with collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection compared with 3 PNA treatments had an ICER greater than $100?000 per QALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis estimated a 44%, 15%, 41%, and 52% chance of a regimen consisting of only PNA being cost-effective in low-severity MCP, high-severity MCP, low-severity PIP, and high-severity PIP joint contractures, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that LF is a cost-effective intervention for recurrent high-severity MCP joint contractures.

24152,Cost-effectiveness of Recurrent Dupuytren Contracture Treatment,"IMPORTANCE: Owing to its tendency to recur, Dupuytren contracture often requires multiple treatments, which places additional economic burden on health care. The likelihood of contracture recurrence varies not only with treatment but also with disease characteristics, such as contracture severity and location, but prior cost-effectiveness analyses of Dupuytren contracture treatments have not considered these patient-specific disease characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To identify the most cost-effective treatment regimen for patients with recurrent Dupuytren contracture. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This economic evaluation was conducted with state-transition microsimulation modeling using data from published studies and Medicare. A simulated cohort of 10?000 individuals with Dupuytren contracture was created. Patients could transition yearly between the following health states: symptom-free, symptomatic, and death. Available treatments were collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection, percutaneous needle aponeurotomy (PNA), and limited fasciectomy (LF); individuals randomly chose any treatment when symptomatic. Patients were limited to 3 rounds of treatment for a contracture affecting 1 joint, totaling 27 unique combinations. If the contracture recurred after 3 treatments, patients lived with the disease for the remainder of life. EXPOSURES: PNA, collagenase clostridium histolyticum injection, or LF. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs (in US dollars), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). A willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000 per quality-adjusted life-year was used to assess cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: For the base case scenario of a patient aged 60 years with recurrent, low-severity metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint contracture, repeated PNA treatment was the only cost-effective treatment (2 PNA treatments followed by LF vs 3 PNA treatments, ICER [Monte Carlo SE]: $212?647/QALY [$36?000/QALY]). For recurrent high-severity MCP joint contractures, treatment regimens composed of PNA and LF were cost-effective (ICER [Monte Carlo SE], $93?932/QALY [$16?500/QALY]). LF was cost-effective for high-severity MCP joint contracture (ICER [Monte Carlo SE], $98?624/QALY [$26?233/QALY]).

24156,Cost-Effectiveness of Maintenance bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin for Intermediate and High Risk Nonmuscle Invasive Bladder Cancer,"PURPOSE: While guidelines support the use of maintenance bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin for patients with intermediate and high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, in an era of bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin shortage we explored the cost-effectiveness of maintenance bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model compared the cost-effectiveness of maintenance bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin to surveillance after induction bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin for intermediate/high risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer from a U.S. Medicare perspective. Five-year oncologic outcomes, toxicity rates and utility values were extracted from the literature. Univariable and multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted. A willingness to pay threshold of $100,000 per quality adjusted life year was considered cost-effective. RESULTS: At 5 years mean costs per patient were $14,858 and $13,973 for maintenance bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin and surveillance, respectively, with quality adjusted life years of 4.046 for both, making surveillance the dominant strategy. On sensitivity analysis full dose and 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin became cost-effective if the absolute reduction in 5-year progression was greater than 2.1% and greater than 0.76%, respectively. On further sensitivity analysis full dose and 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin became cost-effective when maintenance bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin toxicity equaled surveillance toxicity. In multivariable sensitivity analyses using 100,000 Monte-Carlo microsimulations, full dose and 1/3 dose maintenance bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin was cost-effective in 17% and 39% of microsimulations, respectively.

24162,Cost-effectiveness of Interventions to Increase HPV Vaccine Uptake,"OBJECTIVES: We sought to prioritize interventions for increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination coverage based on cost-effectiveness from a US state perspective to inform decisions by policy makers. METHODS: We developed a dynamic simulation model of HPV transmission and progression scaled to a medium-sized US state (5 million individuals). We modeled outcomes over 50 years comparing no intervention to a one-year implementation of centralized reminder and recall for HPV vaccination, school-located HPV vaccination, or quality improvement (QI) visits to primary care clinics. We used probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess a range of plausible outcomes associated with each intervention. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated relative to a conservative willingness-to-pay threshold; $50?000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) . RESULTS: All interventions were cost-effective, relative to no intervention. QI visits had the lowest cost and cost per QALY gained ($1538 versus no intervention). Statewide implementation of centralized reminder and recall cost $28?289 per QALY gained versus QI visits. School-located vaccination had the highest cost but was cost-effective at $18?337 per QALY gained versus QI visits. Scaling to the US population, interventions could avert 3000 to 14?000 future HPV cancers. When varying intervention cost and impact over feasible ranges, interventions were typically preferred to no intervention, but cost-effectiveness varied between intervention strategies. CONCLUSIONS: Three interventions for increasing HPV vaccine coverage were cost-effective and offered substantial health benefits.

24165,The cost-effectiveness of adjunctive corticosteroids for patients with septic shock,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether hydrocortisone is a cost-effective treatment for patients with septic shock. DESIGN: Data linkage-based cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: New South Wales and Queensland intensive care units. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: Patients with septic shock randomly assigned to treatment with hydrocortisone or placebo in the Adjunctive Glucocorticoid Therapy in Patients with Septic Shock (ADRENAL) trial. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Health-related quality of life at 6 months using the EuroQoL 5-dimension 5-level questionnaire. Data on hospital resource use and costs were obtained by linking the ADRENAL dataset to government administrative health databases. Clinical outcomes included mortality, health-related quality of life, and quality-adjusted life-years gained; economic outcomes included hospital resource use, costs and cost-effectiveness from the health care payer perspective. We also assessed cost-effectiveness by sex. To increase the precision of cost-effectiveness estimates, we conducted unrestricted bootstrapping. RESULTS: Of 3800 patients in the ADRENAL trial, 1772 (46.6%) were eligible and 1513 (85.4% of those eligible) were included. There was no difference between hydrocortisone or placebo groups in regards to mortality (218/742 [29.4%] v 227/759 [29.9%]; HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78-1.12; P = 0.47), mean number of QALYs gained (0.10 Â± 0.09 v 0.10 Â± 0.09; P = 0.52), or total hospital costs (A$73 515 Â± 61 376 v A$69 748 Â± 61 793; mean difference, A$3767; 95% CI, -A$2891 to A$10 425; P = 0.27). The incremental cost of hydrocortisone was A$1 254 078 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In females, hydrocortisone was cost-effective in 46.2% of bootstrapped replications and in males it was cost-effective in 2.7% of bootstrapped replications.

24166,Cost-effectiveness of Universal and Targeted Hepatitis C Virus Screening in the United States,"IMPORTANCE: Between 2 and 3.5 million people live with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in the US, most of whom (approximately 75%) are not aware of their disease. Despite the availability of effective HCV treatment in the early stages of infection, HCV will result in thousands of deaths in the next decade in the US. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost-effectiveness of universal screening for all US adults aged 18 years or older for HCV in the US and of targeted screening of people who inject drugs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This simulated economic evaluation used cohort analyses in a Markov model to perform a 10?000-participant Monte Carlo microsimulation trail to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of HCV screening programs, and compared screening programs targeting people who inject drugs with universal screening of US adults age 18 years or older. Data were analyzed in December 2019. EXPOSURES: Cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost per QALY gained. RESULTS: In a 10?000 Monte Carlo microsimulation trail that compared a baseline of individuals aged 40 years (men and women) and people who inject drugs in the US, screening and treatment for HCV were estimated to increase total costs by $10?457 per person and increase QALYs by 0.23 (approximately 3 months), providing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $45?465 per QALY. Also, universal screening and treatment for HCV are estimated to increase total costs by $2845 per person and increase QALYs by 0.01, providing an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $291?277 per QALY.

24168,"The cost-effectiveness of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD","BACKGROUND: Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling condition that generates considerable morbidity, mortality, and both medical and indirect social costs. Treatment options are limited. A novel therapy using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has shown efficacy in six phase 2 trials. Its cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MAP) from the health care payer''s perspective, we constructed a decision-analytic Markov model to portray the costs and health benefits of treating patients with chronic, severe, or extreme, treatment-resistant PTSD with MAP. In six double-blind phase 2 trials, MAP consisted of a mean of 2.5 90-minute trauma-focused psychotherapy sessions before two 8-hour sessions with MDMA (mean dose of 125 mg), followed by a mean of 3.5 integration sessions for each active session. The control group received an inactive placebo or 25-40 mg. of MDMA, and otherwise followed the same regimen. Our model calculates net medical costs, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Efficacy was based on the pooled results of six randomized controlled phase 2 trials with 105 subjects; and a four-year follow-up of 19 subjects. Other inputs were based on published literature and on assumptions when data were unavailable. We modeled results over a 30-year analytic horizon and conducted extensive sensitivity analyses. Our model calculates expected medical costs, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. For 1,000 individuals, MAP generates discounted net savings of $103.2 million over 30 years while accruing 5,553 discounted QALYs, compared to continued standard of care. MAP breaks even on cost at 3.1 years while delivering 918 QALYs. Making the conservative assumption that benefits cease after one year, MAP would accrue net costs of $7.6 million while generating 288 QALYS, or $26,427 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: MAP provided to patients with severe or extreme, chronic PTSD appears to be cost-saving while delivering substantial clinical benefit.

24169,Cost-effectiveness of Yoga for Chronic Low Back Pain in Veterans,"BACKGROUND: Yoga interventions can improve function and reduce pain in persons with chronic low back pain (cLBP). OBJECTIVE: Using data from a recent trial of yoga for military veterans with cLBP, we analyzed the incremental cost-effectiveness of yoga compared with usual care. METHODS: Participants (n=150) were randomized to either 2Ã— weekly, 60-minute yoga sessions for 12 weeks, or to delayed treatment (DT). Outcomes were measured at 12 weeks, and 6 months. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were measured using the EQ-5D scale. A 30% improvement on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (primary outcome) served as an additional effectiveness measure. Intervention costs including personnel, materials, and transportation were tracked during the study. Health care costs were obtained from patient medical records. Health care organization and societal perspectives were examined with a 12-month horizon. RESULTS: Incremental QALYs gained by the yoga group over 12 months were 0.043. Intervention costs to deliver yoga were $307/participant. Negligible differences in health care costs were found between groups. From the health care organization perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to provide yoga was $4488/QALY. From the societal perspective, yoga was ""dominant"" providing both health benefit and cost savings. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates an 89% chance of yoga being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000. A scenario comparing the costs of yoga and physical therapy suggest that yoga may produce similar results at a much lower cost.

DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis. METHODS: The authors performed 11-year and 2-year ophthalmic and societal cost perspective, cost-utility analyses comparing bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept monotherapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (NVAMD). We employed patient utilities, bilateral outcomes, 2018 U.S. dollars, vision-related mortality, a Medicare fee schedule, and CATT (Comparison of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatments) study and VIEW (VEGF Trap-Eye: Investigation of Efficacy and Safety in Wet AMD) trial. Cochrane data were also used. SETTING: Center for Value-Based Medicine. Patient/study population: patients with NVAMD. INTERVENTION: Cost-utility analyses using published data. Data-modeled 10-year vision outcomes were modeled forward to year 11. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: These included cost-utility ratios (CURs), costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. $100,00/QALY was considered the US cost-effectiveness upper limit. RESULTS: Bevacizumab and ranibizumab each conferred an 11-year, 1.339 QALY gain versus observation. Aflibercept conferred a 1.380 QALY gain. Aflibercept conferred greater QALY gain for less cost than ranibizumab but was not cost-effective compared to bevacizumab ($1,151,451/QALY incremental CUR). The average ophthalmic cost perspective CUR for bevacizumab was $11,033/QALY, $79,600/QALY for ranibizumab, and $44,801/QALY for aflibercept. Eleven-year therapies saved a 1.0 year-of-life loss without treatment from the 11.0-year life expectancy. Early treatment was 138%-149% more cost-effective than late treatment. Two-year therapy prevented a 1-month-of-life loss, and revealed bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept conferred 0.141, 0.141, and 0.164 QALY gains, respectively, with corresponding average CURs of $40,371/QALY, $335,726/QALY, and $168,006/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: From an ophthalmic (medical) cost perspective, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept NVAMD monotherapies were all cost-effective over 11 years, with bevacizumab 6.21Ã— more cost-effective than ranibizumab and 3.06Ã— more cost-effective than aflibercept.

The average ophthalmic cost perspective CUR for bevacizumab was $11,033/QALY, $79,600/QALY for ranibizumab, and $44,801/QALY for aflibercept. Eleven-year therapies saved a 1.0 year-of-life loss without treatment from the 11.0-year life expectancy. Early treatment was 138%-149% more cost-effective than late treatment. Two-year therapy prevented a 1-month-of-life loss, and revealed bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept conferred 0.141, 0.141, and 0.164 QALY gains, respectively, with corresponding average CURs of $40,371/QALY, $335,726/QALY, and $168,006/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: From an ophthalmic (medical) cost perspective, bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept NVAMD monotherapies were all cost-effective over 11 years, with bevacizumab 6.21Ã— more cost-effective than ranibizumab and 3.06Ã— more cost-effective than aflibercept.

The average ophthalmic cost perspective CUR for bevacizumab was $11,033/QALY, $79,600/QALY for ranibizumab, and $44,801/QALY for aflibercept. Eleven-year therapies saved a 1.0 year-of-life loss without treatment from the 11.0-year life expectancy. Early treatment was 138%-149% more cost-effective than late treatment. Two-year therapy prevented a 1-month-of-life loss, and revealed bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept conferred 0.141, 0.141, and 0.164 QALY gains, respectively, with corresponding average CURs of $40,371/QALY, $335,726/QALY, and $168,006/QALY, respectively.

24182,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment with additional enrollment to a homeopathic integrated care contract in Germany,"BACKGROUND: A number of German statutory health insurance companies are offering integrated care contracts for homeopathy (ICCHs) that cover the reimbursement of homeopathic treatment. The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these contracts are highly debated. METHODS: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatment after an additional enrollment in an ICCH, a comparative, prospective, observational study was conducted in which participants in the ICCH (HOM group) were compared with matched (on diagnosis, sex and age) insured individuals (CON group) who received usual care alone. Those insured with either migraine or headache, allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis and depression were included. Primary effectiveness outcomes were the baseline adjusted scores of diagnosis-specific questionnaires (e.g. RQLQ, AQLQ, DLQI, BDI-II) after 6?months. Primary cost-effectiveness endpoints were the baseline adjusted total costs from an insurer perspective in relation to the achieved quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were derived from health claims data and QALYs were calculated based on SF-12 data. RESULTS: Data from 2524 participants (1543 HOM group) were analyzed. The primary effectiveness outcomes after six months were statistically significant in favor of the HOM group for migraine or headache (??=?difference between groups, days with headache: -?0.9, p?=?0.042), asthma (?-AQLQ(S): +?0.4, p?=?0.014), atopic dermatitis (?-DLQI: -?5.6, p?=?0.001) and depression (?-BDI-II: -?5.6, p?=?0.001). BDI-II differences reached the minimal clinically important difference. For all diagnoses, the adjusted mean total costs over 12?months were higher in the HOM group from an insurer perspective, with migraine or headache, atopic dermatitis and depression suggesting cost-effectiveness in terms of additional costs per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: After an additional enrollment in the ICCH, the treatment of participants with depression showed minimally clinically relevant improvements. From an insurer perspective, treatment with an ICCH enrollment resulted in higher costs over all diagnoses but seemed to be cost-effective for migraine or headache, atopic dermatitis and depression according to international used threshold values. Based on the study design and further limitations, our findings should be considered cautiously and no conclusions regarding the effectiveness of specific treatment components can be made.

24186,Cost-effectiveness of Screening for Osteoporosis in Older Men With a History of Falls,"IMPORTANCE: Falls and osteoporosis share the potential clinical end point of fractures among older patients. To date, few fall prevention guidelines incorporate screening for osteoporosis to reduce fall-related fractures. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of screening for osteoporosis using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) followed by osteoporosis treatment in older men with a history of falls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a Markov model was developed to simulate the incidence of major osteoporotic fractures in a hypothetical cohort of community-dwelling men aged 65 years who had fallen at least once in the past year. Data sources included literature published from January 1, 1946, to July 31, 2020. The model adopted a societal perspective, a lifetime horizon, a 1-year cycle length, and a discount rate of 3% per year for both health benefits and costs. The analysis was designed and conducted from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Screening with DXA followed by treatment for men diagnosed with osteoporosis compared with usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), measured by cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Among the hypothetical cohort of men aged 65 years, the screening strategy had an ICER of $33?169/QALY gained and was preferred over usual care at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000/QALY gained. The number needed to screen to prevent 1 hip fracture was 1876; to prevent 1 major osteoporotic fracture, 746. The screening strategy would become more effective and less costly than usual care for men 77 years and older. The ICER for the screening strategy did not substantially change across a wide range of assumptions tested in all other deterministic sensitivity analyses. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50?000/QALY gained, screening was cost-effective in 56.0% of simulations; at $100?000/QALY gained, 90.8% of simulations; and at $200?000/QALY gained, 99.6% of simulations.

24189,Cost-effectiveness of Screening for Osteoporosis in Older Men With a History of Falls,"IMPORTANCE: Falls and osteoporosis share the potential clinical end point of fractures among older patients. To date, few fall prevention guidelines incorporate screening for osteoporosis to reduce fall-related fractures. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of screening for osteoporosis using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) followed by osteoporosis treatment in older men with a history of falls. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a Markov model was developed to simulate the incidence of major osteoporotic fractures in a hypothetical cohort of community-dwelling men aged 65 years who had fallen at least once in the past year. Data sources included literature published from January 1, 1946, to July 31, 2020. The model adopted a societal perspective, a lifetime horizon, a 1-year cycle length, and a discount rate of 3% per year for both health benefits and costs. The analysis was designed and conducted from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: Screening with DXA followed by treatment for men diagnosed with osteoporosis compared with usual care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), measured by cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: Among the hypothetical cohort of men aged 65 years, the screening strategy had an ICER of $33?169/QALY gained and was preferred over usual care at the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100?000/QALY gained. The number needed to screen to prevent 1 hip fracture was 1876; to prevent 1 major osteoporotic fracture, 746. The screening strategy would become more effective and less costly than usual care for men 77 years and older.

24190,Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation,"BACKGROUND: The pursuit of a clearer understanding of the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AFib) and the development of new technology has resulted in a surge of interest in the surgical ablation for AFib. Here, we report our 8-year experience in the surgical treatment and management of AFib alongside, evaluating the cost-effectiveness in southern Mainland China over a 1-year follow-up. METHODS: Data of 3,068 patients from March 2011 through June 2019 was retrospectively extracted from The Provincial National Cardiac Database of Xiangya Second Hospital. The activities considered (and costs calculated) were outpatient consultations, hospital admissions, and drug treatment. Quality of life (QoL) questionnaires were also carried out to assess whether concomitant AFib correction procedures increase risk in patients, or improve patient''s QoL. RESULTS: A total of 3,068 patients completed the questionnaires at a minimum of one time-point during the follow-up. The total cost was combined to obtain incremental costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The total costs of the AFib catheter ablation group were remarkably higher compared to surgery as usual group. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $76,513,227 (Â¥542,287,667) per QALY, with an acceptability line graph for cost at 43%. CONCLUSIONS: AFib is an extraordinarily costly and worrisome public health problem. Precision medicine is vital as it provides a platform for the clinical translation of targeted interventions that are designed to help treat and prevent AFib. Thus, to improve the QoL expectancy outcome(s), both therapeutic and surgical interventions should be aimed at addressing the underlying heart disease rather than restoring sinus rhythm.",2020-01-34010,33224744,Cardiovasc Diagn Ther,Chukwuemeka Daniel Iroegbu,2020,10 / 5,1200-1215,No,33224744,"Chukwuemeka Daniel Iroegbu; Wangping Chen; Xun Wu; Luo Cheng; Hao Zhang; Ming Wu; Yuan Zhao; Li Ming Liu; Jinfu Yang; Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, Cardiovasc Diagn Ther, 2020 Oct; 10(5):2223-3652; 1200-1215",QALY,China,Not Stated,Surgical,catheter ablation vs. Standard/Usual Care- Surgery as usual,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Month,Not Stated,Not Stated,76513227,United States,2018,78860664.15

We evaluated the 1-year cost-effectiveness of TKI initiation with imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib among a hypothetical cohort of incident patients with CML from a US payer''s perspective. METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic model to assess quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, net monetary benefit, and incremental cost-effectiveness of treatment strategies. We used published studies and data from the IBM Watson Health MarketScan database for model parameters. To calculate TKI costs, we used the 2018 Federal Supply Schedule estimates for generic imatinib and branded second-generation TKIs. We evaluated cost-effectiveness under various willingness-to-pay thresholds. We accounted for uncertainty with deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, imatinib was favored over dasatinib and nilotinib at a lower cost per QALY gained. Imatinib remained the favored strategy after 1-way variations in TKI costs, TKI switching, QALYs, adverse event risk, and CML progression. When we assessed model uncertainty with prespecified parameter distributions, imatinib was cost-saving compared with dasatinib in 40% of 100?0000 simulations and was favored over all simulations compared with nilotinib. First-line treatment with second-generation TKIs was cost-effective in 50% of simulations at a $200?000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold.

24195,Pneumococcal Vaccination in Adults Aged =65 Years: Cost-Effectiveness and Health Impact in U.S. Populations,"INTRODUCTION: Recommending both the conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines to all U.S. seniors may have little public health impact and be economically unreasonable. Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of using both vaccines in all adults aged =65 years were estimated compared with an alternative strategy (omitting pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the nonimmunocompromised) and with the newly revised recommendation (giving or omitting conjugate vaccine based on patient-physician shared decision making). METHODS: Strategies were examined in hypothetical U.S. 65-year-old population cohorts and segmented into health states based on age- and population-specific data in a Markov state-transition model with a lifetime time horizon from a healthcare perspective. Black population cohorts were examined separately given greater illness risk and lower vaccine uptake.

Outcomes included incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and pneumococcal disease outcomes for each strategy. Data were gathered and analysis performed in 2018. RESULTS: Giving both vaccines, either routinely or with shared decision making, was most effective, reducing pneumococcal disease incidence compared with no vaccination, but costing $765,000-$2.18 million/quality-adjusted life year gained.

24200,Pneumococcal Vaccination in Adults Aged =65 Years: Cost-Effectiveness and Health Impact in U.S. Populations,"INTRODUCTION: Recommending both the conjugate and polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccines to all U.S. seniors may have little public health impact and be economically unreasonable. Public health impact and cost-effectiveness of using both vaccines in all adults aged =65 years were estimated compared with an alternative strategy (omitting pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in the nonimmunocompromised) and with the newly revised recommendation (giving or omitting conjugate vaccine based on patient-physician shared decision making). METHODS: Strategies were examined in hypothetical U.S. 65-year-old population cohorts and segmented into health states based on age- and population-specific data in a Markov state-transition model with a lifetime time horizon from a healthcare perspective. Black population cohorts were examined separately given greater illness risk and lower vaccine uptake. Model parameters came from the Centers for Disease Control Active Core Bacterial Surveillance network, National Health Interview Survey, and Nationwide Inpatient Sample data. Outcomes included incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year gained and pneumococcal disease outcomes for each strategy. Data were gathered and analysis performed in 2018. RESULTS: Giving both vaccines, either routinely or with shared decision making, was most effective, reducing pneumococcal disease incidence compared with no vaccination, but costing $765,000-$2.18 million/quality-adjusted life year gained. Depending on examined population and scenario, the alternative strategy cost $65,700-$226,700/quality-adjusted life year gained (less in black populations) and reduced cases and deaths by 0.3%-0.9%.
