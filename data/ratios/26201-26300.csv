26201,Cost effectiveness analysis of strategies to combat malaria in developing countries,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost effectiveness of selected malaria control interventions in the context of reaching the millennium development goals for malaria. DESIGN: Generalised cost effectiveness analysis. DATA SOURCES: Efficacy data came from the literature and authors' calculations supported by expert opinion. Quantities for resource inputs came from the literature and from expert opinion; prices came from the WHO-CHOICE database. METHODS: Costs were assessed in year 2000 international dollars, and effects were assessed as disability adjusted life years averted by a 10 year implementation programme. Analysis was restricted to sub-Saharan regions where the most deadly form of malaria, Plasmodium falciparum, is most prevalent. The impact on population health for various interventions, and their combinations, was evaluated at selected coverage levels by using a state-transition model. Sensitivity analysis was done for age weights and discounting. RESULTS: High coverage with artemisinin based combination treatments was found to be the most cost effective strategy for control of malaria in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: A much larger infusion of resources than those currently available is needed to make headway in the fight to roll back malaria. On cost effectiveness grounds, in most areas in sub-Saharan Africa greater coverage with highly effective combination treatments should be the cornerstone of malaria control. However, treatment alone can achieve less than half the total benefit obtainable through a combination of interventions-scaling up the use of impregnated mosquito nets or indoor spraying with insecticides is also critical.

26208,Cost effectiveness analysis of strategies to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs and health effects of a range of interventions for preventing the spread of HIV and for treating people with HIV/AIDS in the context of the millennium development goal for combating HIV/AIDS. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on an epidemiological model. SETTING: Analyses undertaken for two regions classified using the WHO epidemiological grouping-Afr-E, countries in sub-Saharan Africa with very high adult and high child mortality, and Sear-D, countries in South East Asia with high adult and high child mortality. DATA SOURCES: Biological and behavioural parameters from clinical and observational studies and population based surveys. Intervention effects and resource inputs based on published reports, expert opinion, and the WHO-CHOICE database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted in 2000 international dollars (Int dollars). RESULTS: In both regions interventions focused on mass media, education and treatment of sexually transmitted infections for female sex workers, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections in the general population cost < Int150 dollars per DALY averted. Voluntary counselling and testing costs < Int350 dollars per DALY averted in both regions, while prevention of mother to child transmission costs < Int50 dollars per DALY averted in Afr-E but around Int850 dollars per DALY in Sear-D. School based education strategies and various antiretroviral treatment strategies cost between Int500 dollars and Int5000 dollars per DALY averted. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing HIV transmission could be done most efficiently through mass media campaigns, interventions for sex workers and treatment of sexually transmitted infections where resources are most scarce. However, prevention of mother to child transmission, voluntary counselling and testing, and school based education would yield further health gains at higher budget levels and would be regarded as cost effective or highly cost effective based on standard international benchmarks.

DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on an epidemiological model. SETTING: Analyses undertaken for two regions classified using the WHO epidemiological grouping-Afr-E, countries in sub-Saharan Africa with very high adult and high child mortality, and Sear-D, countries in South East Asia with high adult and high child mortality. DATA SOURCES: Biological and behavioural parameters from clinical and observational studies and population based surveys. Intervention effects and resource inputs based on published reports, expert opinion, and the WHO-CHOICE database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted in 2000 international dollars (Int dollars). RESULTS: In both regions interventions focused on mass media, education and treatment of sexually transmitted infections for female sex workers, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections in the general population cost < Int150 dollars per DALY averted. Voluntary counselling and testing costs < Int350 dollars per DALY averted in both regions, while prevention of mother to child transmission costs < Int50 dollars per DALY averted in Afr-E but around Int850 dollars per DALY in Sear-D. School based education strategies and various antiretroviral treatment strategies cost between Int500 dollars and Int5000 dollars per DALY averted.

SETTING: Analyses undertaken for two regions classified using the WHO epidemiological grouping-Afr-E, countries in sub-Saharan Africa with very high adult and high child mortality, and Sear-D, countries in South East Asia with high adult and high child mortality. DATA SOURCES: Biological and behavioural parameters from clinical and observational studies and population based surveys. Intervention effects and resource inputs based on published reports, expert opinion, and the WHO-CHOICE database. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted in 2000 international dollars (Int dollars). RESULTS: In both regions interventions focused on mass media, education and treatment of sexually transmitted infections for female sex workers, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections in the general population cost < Int150 dollars per DALY averted. Voluntary counselling and testing costs < Int350 dollars per DALY averted in both regions, while prevention of mother to child transmission costs < Int50 dollars per DALY averted in Afr-E but around Int850 dollars per DALY in Sear-D. School based education strategies and various antiretroviral treatment strategies cost between Int500 dollars and Int5000 dollars per DALY averted. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing HIV transmission could be done most efficiently through mass media campaigns, interventions for sex workers and treatment of sexually transmitted infections where resources are most scarce. However, prevention of mother to child transmission, voluntary counselling and testing, and school based education would yield further health gains at higher budget levels and would be regarded as cost effective or highly cost effective based on standard international benchmarks.

26236,Cost effectiveness analysis of strategies for tuberculosis control in developing countries,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs and health effects of tuberculosis control interventions in Africa and South East Asia in the context of the millennium development goals. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on an epidemiological model. SETTING: Analyses undertaken for two regions classified by WHO according to their epidemiological grouping-Afr-E, countries in sub-Saharan Africa with very high adult and high child mortality, and Sear-D, countries in South East Asia with high adult and high child mortality. DATA SOURCES: Published studies, costing databases, expert opinion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted in 2000 international dollars (dollarsInt). RESULTS: Treatment of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis in DOTS programmes cost dollarsInt6-8 per DALY averted in Afr-E and dollarsInt7 per DALY averted in Sear-D at coverage levels of 50-95%. In Afr-E, adding treatment of smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases at a coverage level of 95% cost dollarsInt95 per DALY averted; the addition of DOTS-Plus treatment for multidrug resistant cases cost dollarsInt123. In Sear-D, these costs were dollarsInt52 and dollarsInt226, respectively. The full combination of interventions could reduce prevalence and mortality by over 50% in Sear-D between 1990 and 2010, and by almost 50% between 2000 and 2010 in Afr-E. CONCLUSIONS: DOTS treatment of new smear-positive cases is the first priority in tuberculosis control, including in countries with high HIV prevalence.

26237,Health care costs of diarrheal disease and estimates of the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Vietnam,"Rotavirus disease causes a significant health and economic burden worldwide. Several rotavirus vaccines may soon be available for use. A country's decision to introduce these vaccines will depend on its rotavirus disease burden, on the cost of the vaccine, and on the results of an economic assessment of the cost and effectiveness of a rotavirus vaccination program.Data on medical and nonmedical direct costs and indirect costs were established in Khanh Hoa Province, Vietnam, and extrapolated to national estimates on the basis of the birth cohort in 2004. The main outcome measures were economic burden and cost-effectiveness ratio (United States dollars per disability-adjusted life-year averted and dollars per life saved) of vaccination.The disease burden is equivalent to an economic burden of an estimated 3.1 million US dollars in medical direct costs, 685,000 US dollars in nonmedical direct costs, and 1.5 million US dollars in indirect costs. From a societal perspective, treatment of rotavirus disease costs an estimated 5.3 million US dollars per year. From the health care system perspective, universal vaccination of infants at a cost of < or = 7.26 US dollars/vaccine dose would be a cost-effective public health intervention, according to the World Bank cost-effectiveness standard for low-income countries (140 US dollars/disability-adjusted life-year).Vaccination can effectively reduce the disease burden and health care costs of rotavirus-specific diarrhea in Vietnam.",2005-99-12408,16235169,J Infect Dis,Thea K Fischer,2005,192 / 10,1720-6,No,16235169,"Thea K Fischer; Dang Duc Anh; Lynn Antil; N D L Cat; Paul E Kilgore; Vu D Thiem; Rick Rheingans; Le H Tho; Roger I Glass; Joseph S Bresee; Health care costs of diarrheal disease and estimates of the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccination in Vietnam, J Infect Dis, ; 192(10):0022-1899; 1720-6",DALY,Viet Nam,Not Stated,Immunization,Rotavirus vaccination vs. None,Not Stated,5 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,3.00,91,United States,2004,124.68
26238,"Prostate cancer, the PSA test and academic detailing in Australian general practice: an economic evaluation","OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether introduction of a national education program for GPs to improve decision making relating to the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing for screening represents 'value-for-money' from the perspective of the Australian Government. METHODS: The annual equivalent costs and consequences of a proposed national program in steady state operation are estimated for Australia using 1996 as the reference year. Because of the controversy about the efficacy of screening using PSA testing, two scenarios are modelled. Uncertainty in the model is examined using Monte Carlo simulation methods. RESULTS: In scenario one, our model predicts that the national program would cost dollars 12.5 million (gross) or dollars 6.6 million (net), would reduce the burden of disease by 4.7% of total DALYs due to prostate cancer in those aged 70 and over, with no loss of life and an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of dollars 16,000/DALY (gross) and dollars 8,500/DALY (net). In scenario two, the proposed program would cost dollars 12.5 million (gross) or dollars 7.1 million (net), would reduce the burden of disease by 3.1% of total, increase by 44 the prostate cancer deaths at an ICER of dollars 24,000/DALY (gross) and dollars 14,000/DALY (net). CONCLUSIONS: These findings, with an overall health benefit at moderate cost and acceptable ICER, support the case for consideration of a national education program on the assumption that prostate cancer screening over age 70 does not reduce mortality. A larger Australian study currently being conducted should provide stronger evidence on the value of implementing a full national program.",2005-99-01662,16222933,Aust N Z J Public Health,Christine A Stone,2006,29 / 4,349-57,No,16222933,"Christine A Stone; Frank W May; Carole B Pinnock; Mark Elwood; Debra S Rowett; Frank W May; Carole B Pinnock; Mark Elwood; Debra S Rowett; Prostate cancer, the PSA test and academic detailing in Australian general practice: an economic evaluation, Aust N Z J Public Health, 2005-Aug; 29(4):1326-0200; 349-57",DALY,Australia,Not Stated,"Health Education or Behavior, Screening",Education to improve decision making relating to prostate specific antigen testing vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,,3.00,3.00,8500,Australia,1996,10976.09
26239,Antenatal syphilis screening in sub-Saharan Africa: lessons learned from Tanzania,"OBJECTIVES; To synthesise data from four recent studies in Tanzania examining maternal syphilis screening and its operational implementation in routine antenatal clinics (ANC), drawing lessons for strengthened antenatal services for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV.The impact of untreated maternal syphilis was examined in a retrospective cohort of 380 Tanzanian women. Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening and single dose benzathine penicillin treatment were prospectively examined in 1688 pregnant women. Observation, interviews and facility audits were carried out in health facilities within nine districts to determine the operational reality of syphilis screening.Overall, 49% of women with untreated high titre syphilis experienced an adverse pregnancy outcome compared with 11% of uninfected women. Stillbirth and low birthweight rates among those treated for high- or low-titre syphilis were reduced to rates similar to those for uninfected women. The economic cost was $1.44 per woman screened and $10.56 per disability-adjusted life year saved. In the operational study, only 43% of 2256 ANC attenders observed were screened and only 61% of seroreactive women and 37% of their partners were treated. Adequate training, continuity of supplies, supervision and quality control are critical elements for strengthened antenatal services, but are frequently overlooked.Maternal syphilis has a severe impact on pregnancy outcome. Same-day screening and treatment strategies are clinically effective and highly cost-effective, but there are significant challenges to implementing syphilis screening programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. Current PMTCT interventions present an opportunity to reinforce and improve syphilis screening. Increasing PMTCT coverage will involve similar operational challenges to those faced by syphilis screening programmes.",2005-99-12352,16135202,Trop Med Int Health,Deborah Watson-Jones,2005,10 / 9,934-43,No,16135202,"Deborah Watson-Jones; Monique Oliff; Fern Terris-Prestholt; John Changalucha; Balthazar Gumodoka; Philippe Mayaud; Ave Maria Semakafu; Lilani Kumaranayake; Awene Gavyole; David Mabey; Richard Hayes; Antenatal syphilis screening in sub-Saharan Africa: lessons learned from Tanzania, Trop Med Int Health, ; 10(9):1360-2276; 934-43",DALY,Tanzania,Not Stated,"Maternal / Neonatal / Reproductive Care, Pharmaceutical, Screening",Maternal syphilis screening and single dose benzathine penicillin treatment vs. None,Pregnant women + neonates,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,,Not Stated,Not Stated,10.56,United States,2001,15.43

As part of the Assessing Cost-effectiveness -- Mental Health project we evaluate the available evidence on costs and benefits of CBT and drugs in the episodic and maintenance treatment of major depression.The cost-effectiveness is modelled from a health-care perspective as the cost per disability-adjusted life year. Interventions are targeted at people with major depression who currently seek care but receive non-evidence based treatment. Uncertainty in model inputs is tested using Monte Carlo simulation methods.All interventions for major depression examined have a favourable incremental cost-effectiveness ratio under Australian health service conditions.

Maintenance treatment with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is the most expensive option (ranging from 17,000 Australian dollars to 20,000 Australian dollars per DALY) but still well below 50,000 Australian dollars, which is considered the affordable threshold.A range of cost-effective interventions for episodes of major depression exists and is currently underutilized. Maintenance treatment strategies are required to significantly reduce the burden of depression, but the cost of long-term drug treatment for the large number of depressed people is high if SSRIs are the drug of choice.

26296,Economic effects of echinococcosis in a disease-endemic region of the Tibetan Plateau,"This report attempts to quantify the economic losses due to Echinococcus multilocularis and E. granulosus in Shiqu County, Sichuan, People's Republic of China, as well as illustrate the cost effectiveness of dog anthelmintic prophylaxis combined with a sheep and goat vaccination program in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved. We evaluated human losses associated with treatment costs and loss of income due to morbidity and mortality, in addition to production losses in livestock due to E. granulosus infection. Annual combined human and animal losses (95% confidence interval) is estimated to reach 218,676 U.S. dollars (189,850-247,871 U.S. dollars) if only liver-related losses in sheep, goats, and yaks are taken into account. This equates to approximately 3.47 U.S. dollars per person annually or 1.4% of per capita gross domestic product. However, total annual losses can be nearly 1,000,000 U.S. dollars if additional livestock production losses are assumed. Eventual prevention of 65-95% of annual losses due to cystic echinococcosis is suggested with proposed biannual dog anthelmintic prophylaxis and a sheep and goat vaccination program. Prevention of 9-50% of human alveolar echinococcosis-associated losses is suggested based on stochastic models for the current epidemiologic situation. The median estimated cost of the program would be approximately 56,000 U.S. dollars per year, which is a fraction of the estimated combined livestock and human financial losses due to the disease. Overall cost for the proposed control program is within the World Health Organization second most cost-effective band of less than 150 U.S. dollars per DALY averted. However, cost per DALY averted would be less than 25 U.S. dollars dollars for the human health sector if cost sharing was implemented between the public health and agricultural sectors based on proportional benefit from control.",2005-99-12300,16014823,Am J Trop Med Hyg,Christine M Budke,2005,73 / 1,2-10,No,16014823,"Christine M Budke; QIU Jiamin; WANG Qian; Paul R Torgerson; Economic effects of echinococcosis in a disease-endemic region of the Tibetan Plateau, Am J Trop Med Hyg, ; 73(1):0002-9637; 2-10",DALY,China,Not Stated,"Environmental, Immunization, Other",Biannual dog anthelmintic prophylaxis and a sheep and goat vaccination program vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,,3.00,Not Stated,106.88,United States,2001,156.19
26297,Cost-effectiveness of first-line antiepileptic drug treatments in the developing world: a population-level analysis,"PURPOSE: To establish the population-level costs and cost-effectiveness of first-line antiepileptic drug (AED) treatments for reducing the treatment gap in developing countries. METHODS: A population model was applied to nine World Health Organization (WHO) developing subregions to estimate the impact of four first-line AEDs in the primary care management of (ICD-10 defined) idiopathic epilepsy and epileptic syndromes: phenobarbitone (PB), phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), and valproic acid (VPA). The efficacy of treatment was gauged in terms of improvements to both disability and recovery, subsequently adjusted for treatment coverage, response, and adherence. Total population-level treatment effects (measured in disability-adjusted life years or DALYs averted) and treatment costs (measured in international dollars; IUS dollars) were combined to form ratios of cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Across nine developing WHO subregions, extending AED treatment coverage to 50% of primary epilepsy cases would avert between 150 and 650 DALYs per one million population (equivalent to 13-40% of the current burden), at an annual cost per capita of IUS dollars 0.20-1.33. Older first-line AEDs (PB, PHT) were most cost-effective on account of their similar efficacy but lower acquisition cost (IUS dollars 800-2,000 for each DALY averted). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of the current burden of epilepsy in developing countries is avertable by scaling-up the routine availability of low-cost AEDs.

Total population-level treatment effects (measured in disability-adjusted life years or DALYs averted) and treatment costs (measured in international dollars; IUS dollars) were combined to form ratios of cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Across nine developing WHO subregions, extending AED treatment coverage to 50% of primary epilepsy cases would avert between 150 and 650 DALYs per one million population (equivalent to 13-40% of the current burden), at an annual cost per capita of IUS dollars 0.20-1.33. Older first-line AEDs (PB, PHT) were most cost-effective on account of their similar efficacy but lower acquisition cost (IUS dollars 800-2,000 for each DALY averted). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of the current burden of epilepsy in developing countries is avertable by scaling-up the routine availability of low-cost AEDs. Critical factors in the successful implementation of such a scaled-up level of service delivery, apart from renewed political support and investment, relate to appropriate training and continuity of drug supply.",2005-XX-01414,15857443,Epilepsia,Dan Chisholm,2005,46 / 5,751-9,No,15857443,"Dan Chisholm; Cost-effectiveness of first-line antiepileptic drug treatments in the developing world: a population-level analysis, Epilepsia, 2005-May; 46(5):0013-9580; 751-9",DALY,"Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Chad, Comoros, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Mauritius, Niger, Nigeria, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Togo",Not Stated,Pharmaceutical,Valproic acid vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,,3.00,3.00,1598,United States,2000,2401.74
