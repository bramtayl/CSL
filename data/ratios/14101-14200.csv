14101,Cost-utility analysis of memantine extended release added to cholinesterase inhibitors compared to cholinesterase inhibitor monotherapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dementia of the Alzheimer's type in the US,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of memantine extended release (ER) as an add-on therapy to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) [combination therapy] for treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe Alzheimer's disease (AD) from both a healthcare payer and a societal perspective over 3 years when compared to AChEI monotherapy in the US. METHODS: A phase III trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of memantine ER for treatment of AD patients taking an AChEI. The analysis assessed the long-term costs and health outcomes using an individual patient simulation in which AD progression is modeled in terms of cognition, behavior, and functioning changes. Input parameters are based on patient-level trial data, published literature, and publicly available data sources. Changes in anti-psychotic medication use are incorporated based on a published retrospective cohort study. Costs include drug acquisition and monitoring, total AD-related medical care, and informal care associated with caregiver time. Incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), life years, care time for caregiver, time in community and institution, time on anti-psychotics, time by disease severity, and time without severe symptoms are reported. Costs and health outcomes are discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: Considering a societal perspective over 3 years, this analysis shows that memantine ER combined with an AChEI provides better clinical outcomes and lower costs than AChEI monotherapy. Discounted average savings were estimated at $18,355 and $20,947 per patient and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) increased by an average of 0.12 and 0.13 from a societal and healthcare payer perspective, respectively. Patients on combination therapy spent an average of 4 months longer living at home and spend less time in moderate-severe and severe stages of the disease.

14103,Cost-Effectiveness of New Direct-Acting Antivirals to Prevent Post-Liver Transplant Recurrent Hepatitis,"Preliminary studies on HCV-cirrhotics listed for transplant suggest that sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin is very effective in promoting viral clearance and preventing disease recurrence. Unfortunately, the high cost of such treatment (euro46 500 per 12 weeks of treatment) makes its cost-effectiveness questionable. A semi-Markov model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of sofosbuvir/ribavirin treatment in cirrhotic patients without HCC (HCV-CIRRH) and with HCC (HCV-HCC) listed for transplant. In the base-case analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for 24 weeks of sofosbuvir/ribavirin was euro44 875 per quality-adjusted life-year gained in HCV-CIRRH and euro60 380 in HCV-HCC patients. Both results were above the willingness to pay threshold of euro37 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. Our data also show that in order to remain cost-effective (with a 24-week treatment), any novel interferon-free treatment endowed with ideal efficacy should cost less than euro67 224 or euro95 712 in HCV-cirrhotics with and without HCC, respectively. The results shows that sofosbuvir/ribavirin therapy, given to patients listed for transplant, is not cost-effective at current prices despite being very effective, and new, more effective treatments will have little economic margins to remain cost-effective.

14105,Defining the Value of Future Research to Identify the Preferred Treatment of Meniscal Tear in the Presence of Knee Osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND: Arthroscopic partial meniscectomy (APM) is extensively used to relieve pain in patients with symptomatic meniscal tear (MT) and knee osteoarthritis (OA). Recent studies have failed to show the superiority of APM compared to other treatments. We aim to examine whether existing evidence is sufficient to reject use of APM as a cost-effective treatment for MT+OA. METHODS: We built a patient-level microsimulation using Monte Carlo methods and evaluated three strategies: Physical therapy ('PT') alone; PT followed by APM if subjects continued to experience pain ('Delayed APM'); and 'Immediate APM'. Our subject population was US adults with symptomatic MT and knee OA over a 10 year time horizon. We assessed treatment outcomes using societal costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), incorporating productivity costs as a sensitivity analysis. We also conducted a value-of-information analysis using probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Calculated ICERs were estimated to be $12,900/QALY for Delayed APM as compared to PT and $103,200/QALY for Immediate APM as compared to Delayed APM. In sensitivity analyses, inclusion of time costs made Delayed APM cost-saving as compared to PT. Improving efficacy of Delayed APM led to higher incremental costs and lower incremental effectiveness of Immediate APM in comparison to Delayed APM. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that PT had 3.0% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000/QALY. Delayed APM was cost effective 57.7% of the time at WTP = $50,000/QALY and 50.2% at WTP = $100,000/QALY. The probability of Immediate APM being cost-effective did not exceed 50% unless WTP exceeded $103,000/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that current cost-effectiveness evidence does not support unqualified rejection of either Immediate or Delayed APM for the treatment of MT+OA.

14107,Cost-Effectiveness of Pediatric Heart Transplantation Across a Positive Crossmatch for High Waitlist Urgency Candidates,"Allosensitized children listed with a requirement for a negative prospective crossmatch have high mortality. Previously, we found that listing with the intent to accept the first suitable organ offer, regardless of the possibility of a positive crossmatch (TAKE strategy), results in a survival advantage from the time of listing compared to awaiting transplantation across a negative crossmatch (WAIT). The cost-effectiveness of these strategies is unknown. We used Markov modeling to compare cost-effectiveness between these waitlist strategies for allosensitized children listed urgently for heart transplantation. We used registry data to estimate costs and waitlist/posttransplant outcomes. We assumed patients remained in hospital after listing, no positive crossmatches for WAIT, and a base-case probability of a positive crossmatch of 47% for TAKE. Accepting the first suitable organ offer cost less ($405 904 vs. $534 035) and gained more quality-adjusted life years (3.71 vs. 2.79). In sensitivity analyses, including substitution of waitlist data from children with unacceptable antigens specified during listing, TAKE remained cost-saving or cost-effective. Our findings suggest acceptance of the first suitable organ offer for urgently listed allosensitized pediatric heart transplant candidates is cost-effective and transplantation should not be denied because of allosensitization status alone.",2015-01-17868,26082322,Int J Public Health,B Feingold,2015,/,,No,26082322,"B Feingold; S A Webber; C L Bryce; S Y Park; H E Tomko; S C West; S A Hart; W T Mahle; K J Smith; Cost-Effectiveness of Pediatric Heart Transplantation Across a Positive Crossmatch for High Waitlist Urgency Candidates, Int J Public Health, 2015 Jun 16; ():1661-8564",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Listing with the intent to accept the first suitable organ offer, regardless of the possibility of a positive crossmatch (TAKE strategy) vs. Awaiting transplantation across a negative crossmatch (WAIT)",Allosensitized children requiring heart transplantation,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-139272.83,United States,2012,-156996
14108,Is febrile neutropenia prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating factors economically justified for adjuvant TC chemotherapy in breast cancer?,"PURPOSE: Febrile neutropenia (FN) during adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with morbidity, mortality risk, and substantial cost, and subsequent chemotherapy dose reductions may result in poorer outcomes. Patients at high risk of, or who develop FN, often receive prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF). We investigated whether different prophylaxis strategies with G-CSF offered favorable value-for-money. METHODS: We developed a decision model to estimate the short- and long-term costs and outcomes of a hypothetical cohort of women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant taxotere + cyclophosphamide (TC) chemotherapy. The short-term phase estimated upfront costs and FN risks with adjuvant TC chemotherapy without G-CSF prophylaxis (i.e., chemotherapy dose reductions) as well as with secondary and primary G-CSF prophylaxis strategies. The long-term phase estimated the expected costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for patients who completed adjuvant TC chemotherapy with or without one or more episodes of FN. RESULTS: Secondary G-CSF was associated with lower costs and greater QALY gains than a no G-CSF strategy. Primary G-CSF appears likely to be cost-effective relative to secondary G-CSF at FN rates greater than 28 %, assuming some loss of chemotherapy efficacy at lower dose intensities. The cost-effectiveness of primary vs. secondary G-CSF was sensitive to FN risk and mortality, and loss of chemotherapy efficacy following FN. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary G-CSF is more effective and less costly than a no G-CSF strategy. Primary G-CSF may be justified at higher willingness-to-pay thresholds and/or higher FN risks, but this threshold FN risk appears to be higher than the 20 % rate recommended by current clinical guidelines.",2015-01-17871,26081595,Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf,Chris Skedgel,2015,/,,No,26081595,"Chris Skedgel; Daniel Rayson; Tallal Younis; Is febrile neutropenia prophylaxis with granulocyte-colony stimulating factors economically justified for adjuvant TC chemotherapy in breast cancer?, Jt Comm J Qual Patient Saf, 2015 Aug 28; ():1553-7250",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Secondary granulocyte-colony stimulating factor prophylaxis strategy vs. None,Receiving adjuvant taxotere + cyclophosphamide chemotherapy,Not Stated,19 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-10850,Canada,2014,-10746.2

14110,Cost-Effectiveness of an Individualized First-Line Treatment Strategy Offering Erlotinib Based on EGFR Mutation Testing in Advanced Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is among the top causes of cancer-related deaths. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors can increase progression-free survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of EGFR mutation analysis and first-line therapy with erlotinib for mutation-positive patients compared with non-individualized standard chemotherapy from the perspective of German statutory health insurance. METHODS: A state transition model was developed for a time horizon of 10 years (reference year 2014). Data sources were published data from the European Tarceva versus Chemotherapy (EURTAC) randomized trial for drug efficacy and safety and German cost data. We additionally performed deterministic, probabilistic and structural sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The individualized strategy incurred 0.013 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and additional costs of <euro>200, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of <euro>15,577/QALY. Results were most sensitive to uncertainty in survival curves and changes in utility values. Cross-validating health utility estimates with recent German data increased the ICER to about <euro>58,000/QALY. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that the individualized strategy is cost-effective, with a probability exceeding 50 % for a range of possible willingness-to-pay thresholds. LIMITATIONS: The uncertainty of the predicted survival curves is substantial, particularly for overall survival, which was not a primary endpoint in the EURTAC study. Also, there is limited data on quality of life in metastatic lung cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized therapy based on EGFR mutation status has the potential to provide a cost-effective alternative to non-individualized care for patients with advanced adenocarcinoma.

METHODS: A Markov model was developed using data from a systematic literature review. Three base cases were evaluated: (1) a 60-year-old patient with three lesions in the right hemi-liver who underwent 6 months of sCT, had normalized carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and was diagnosed with DLM through a computed tomography (CT) scan; (2) a 60-year-old patient with three lesions in the right hemi-liver who underwent 6 months of sCT, had normalized CEA, and was diagnosed with DLM through a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan; and (3) a 60-year-old patient with three lesions in the right hemi-liver who underwent 6 months of sCT plus hepatic artery infusion (HAI), had normalized CEA, and was diagnosed with DLM through a MRI scan. The outcomes evaluated were quality-adjusted life months (QALMs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and net health benefit (NHB). RESULTS: The NHB of strategy A versus strategy B was positive in base case 1 (7.7 QALMs, ICER $34.449/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) and base case 2 (1.6 QALMs, ICER $43,948/QALY). In contrast it was negative (-0.2 QALMs, ICER $72,474/QALY) for base case 3. Monte Carlo simulation showed that strategy B is acceptable only in old patients (>60 years) with normalized CEA and MRI-based diagnosis. In younger patients, strategy B may reach cost-effectiveness only after sCT plus HAI.

Three base cases were evaluated: (1) a 60-year-old patient with three lesions in the right hemi-liver who underwent 6 months of sCT, had normalized carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and was diagnosed with DLM through a computed tomography (CT) scan; (2) a 60-year-old patient with three lesions in the right hemi-liver who underwent 6 months of sCT, had normalized CEA, and was diagnosed with DLM through a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan; and (3) a 60-year-old patient with three lesions in the right hemi-liver who underwent 6 months of sCT plus hepatic artery infusion (HAI), had normalized CEA, and was diagnosed with DLM through a MRI scan. The outcomes evaluated were quality-adjusted life months (QALMs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and net health benefit (NHB). RESULTS: The NHB of strategy A versus strategy B was positive in base case 1 (7.7 QALMs, ICER $34.449/quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) and base case 2 (1.6 QALMs, ICER $43,948/QALY). In contrast it was negative (-0.2 QALMs, ICER $72,474/QALY) for base case 3. Monte Carlo simulation showed that strategy B is acceptable only in old patients (>60 years) with normalized CEA and MRI-based diagnosis. In younger patients, strategy B may reach cost-effectiveness only after sCT plus HAI.

14114,Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatment of venous thromboembolism with rivaroxaban compared with combined low molecular weight heparin/vitamin K antagonist,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a burden on healthcare systems. Standard treatment involves parenteral anticoagulation overlapping with a vitamin K antagonist, an approach that is effective but associated with limitations including the need for frequent coagulation monitoring. The direct oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban is similarly effective to standard therapy as a single-drug treatment for VTE and does not require routine coagulation monitoring. The objective of this economic evaluation was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban compared with standard VTE treatment from a UK perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed using data and probabilities derived from the EINSTEIN DVT and EINSTEIN PE studies of rivaroxaban and other published sources. Health outcomes included VTE rates, bleeding events avoided, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: There was greater discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy with rivaroxaban than with standard therapy, irrespective of indication and treatment duration. Rivaroxaban was associated with per-patient cost savings for each treatment duration modelled (3, 6 and 12 months), and these were greatest with shorter durations. Rivaroxaban was found to be dominant (cheaper and more effective) and, therefore, cost-effective, in both patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in all three treatment duration groups, and was also cost-effective in patients requiring lifelong anticoagulation (ICERs: pound8677 per QALY and pound7072 per QALY in patients with index deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, respectively). The cost-effectiveness of rivaroxaban was largely insensitive to variations in one-way sensitivity analysis. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY, rivaroxaban had a consistent probability of being cost-effective, compared with LMWH/VKA treatment, of around 80% regardless of index VTE or duration of anticoagulation therapy (3, 6, 12 months or lifelong).

14118,Electrocardiographic Screening for Prolonged QT Interval to Reduce Sudden Cardiac Death in Psychiatric Patients: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"IMPORTANCE: Sudden cardiac death is a leading cause of mortality in psychiatric patients. Long QT (LQT) is common in this population and predisposes to Torsades-de-Pointes (TdP) and subsequent mortality. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of electrocardiographic screening to detect LQT in psychiatric inpatients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We built a decision analytic model based on a decision tree to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and utility of LQT screening from a health care perspective. LQT proportion parameters were derived from an in-hospital cross-sectional study. We performed experts' elicitation to estimate the risk of TdP, given extent of QT prolongation. A TdP reduction of 65% after LQT detection was based on positive drug dechallenge rate and through adequate treatment and electrolyte adjustments. The base-case model uncertainty was assessed with one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Finally, the TdP related mortality and TdP avoidance parameters were varied in a two-way sensitivity analysis to assess their effect on the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs, Quality Ajusted Life Year (QALY), ICER, and probability of cost effectiveness thresholds ($ 10,000, $25,000, and $50,000 per QALY). RESULTS: In the base-case scenario, the numbers of patients needed to screen were 1128 and 2817 to avoid one TdP and one death, respectively. The ICER of systematic ECG screening was $8644 (95%CI, 3144-82 498) per QALY. The probability of cost-effectiveness was 96% at a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 for one QALY. In sensitivity analyses, results were sensitive to the case-fatality of TdP episodes and to the TdP reduction following the diagnosis of LQT.

14119,"Modelling the cost-effectiveness of combination therapy for early, rapidly progressing rheumatoid arthritis by simulating the reversible and irreversible effects of the disease","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of adalimumab plus methotrexate (MTX) versus MTX monotherapy in early, aggressive rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when explicitly modelling short-term (reversible) and long-term (irreversible, ie, joint damage) disease activity and physical function. METHODS: A microsimulation model was developed to unify, in a single cost-effectiveness model, measures of reversible and irreversible disease activity and physical function based on data from the PREMIER trial. Short term, reversible disease activity was modelled using DAS28 variables, including swollen joint counts, tender joint counts, C reactive protein concentration and pain. The DAS28 variables were then used in a logistic regression to predict short-term American College of Rheumatology (ACR) responses, which informed treatment continuation and switches. Long term, irreversible, radiographically documented joint damage was modelled using modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS). The model then linked both short-term disease activity and mTSS to the Health Assessment Questionnaire score, which was used to calculate direct and indirect costs, and quality adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: When both reversible and irreversible effects of therapy were included, combination therapy was estimated to produce 6-month 50% ACR responses in 75% of patients versus 54% in MTX monotherapy. Compared to MTX monotherapy, combination therapy resulted in 2.68 and 3.04 discounted life years and QALYs gained, respectively. Combination therapy also resulted in a net increase in direct costs of pound106,207 for a resulting incremental cost/QALY gain of pound32,425. When indirect costs were included in the analysis, the ICER (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio) decreased to pound27,238. Disregarding irreversible effects increased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio to pound78,809 (when only direct costs were included).

14123,Cost-effectiveness of tobacco cessation support combined with tuberculosis screening among contacts who smoke,"SETTING: Tobacco smoking is associated with significantly increased risks of latent tuberculous infection, active tuberculosis (TB), TB recurrence and mortality. Tobacco cessation interventions not only increase health benefits, they also reduce the risk of TB. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) combined with TB screening strategies using interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs; QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT] and T-SPOT((R)).TB [T-SPOT]) and comparing these with the tuberculin skin test (TST) among TB contacts who smoke. DESIGN: Decision trees and Markov models were constructed from a public health perspective. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 20-year-old contacts who smoke until the age of 70 years, with or without NRT. The main outcome measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was compared. RESULTS: QFT alone led to lower costs but fewer QALYs. TST alone and TST+NRT were absolutely dominated. IGRAs+NRT yielded greater benefits than IGRAs alone, and T-SPOT+NRT yielded the greatest benefits.

This study sought to model the cost-effectiveness of fingolimod compared to dimethyl fumarate (DMF), for which relevant HA RRMS sub-group data were available, from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. METHODS: A cohort Markov model based on Expanded Disability Status Scale scores, similar to previous model designs, was constructed. Published post hoc clinical data in the HA RRMS sub-groups were taken from the pivotal trials for fingolimod and DMF vs placebo. Utility data for each health state and for relapses were used in line with previous similar models. Published costs were inflated to NHS cost year 2013-2014 and UK list prices used for both drugs. Possible Patient Access Scheme (PAS) discount scenarios were investigated. RESULTS: In the base case, using list prices for each DMT, the average probabilistic incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for fingolimod vs DMF was found to be pound14,076, with a 73% chance of fingolimod being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound30,000. Scenario and sensitivity analyses showed that uncertainty in disability progression efficacy was a key model driver. The model was robust to other changes and the majority of PAS permutations do not contradict the base case finding of cost-effectiveness of fingolimod. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, fingolimod remains cost-effective in HA RRMS following the introduction of DMF to the UK market, and this paper supports the evidence that has led fingolimod to be the only oral DMT reimbursed for HA RRMS in England.

14130,Inhaled Aztreonam Lysine versus Inhaled Tobramycin in Cystic Fibrosis. An Economic Evaluation,"RATIONALE: Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis and is associated with a high economic burden. A recently published comparator trial demonstrated that outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis with chronic P. aeruginosa infections switched from tobramycin solution for inhalation to aztreonam lysine for inhalation were better than those of patients who continued on tobramycin. OBJECTIVES: To compare overall costs of treatment of chronic inhaled tobramycin and aztreonam lysine in patient with cystic fibrosis who have chronic Pseudomonas infection, taking differences in outcomes into account. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis with a 3-year time horizon was performed to simulate the economic consequences of either treatment from the perspective of a third party payer in the United States. We extrapolated results from the comparator trial and used data regarding clinical outcomes, quality of life, and costs from published literature and proprietary databases. A Markov structure was used to consider transitions between health states, defined principally by levels of percent predicted of FEV1. Extensive scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Use of aztreonam lysine for inhalation was associated with an average cost saving of $41,947 per patient over 3 years, as well as greater quality-adjusted life-years and total life-years. Scenario analyses demonstrated that these findings were robust to changes in key assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: It appears, with high likelihood, that the use of aztreonam solution for inhalation is associated with cost savings, an increase in quality-adjusted life-years, and improved clinical outcomes among patients with extensive prior use of tobramycin solution for inhalation who are naive to inhaled aztreonam lysine.",2015-01-17925,26053185,Transcult Psychiatry,Michael S Schechter,2015,12 / 7,1030-8,No,26053185,"Michael S Schechter; David Trueman; Rachel Farquharson; Keiko Higuchi; Cori L Daines; Inhaled Aztreonam Lysine versus Inhaled Tobramycin in Cystic Fibrosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was developed to evaluate the costs and effectiveness associated with EVE+EXE, exemestane (EXE), fulvestrant (FUL), and tamoxifen (TAM) over a 10-year time horizon. The model included 3 health states: responsive/stable disease, progression, or death. Monthly transition probabilities were estimated based on the BOLERO-2 (Breast cancer trials of OraL EveROlimus-2) data and network meta-analyses. Costs included drug acquisition and administration costs, medical costs associated health states, and costs for managing adverse events (AEs). Utilities for each health state and disutilities for AEs were derived from the literature. Incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were estimated by comparing EVE+EXE with each endocrine monotherapy. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base case, EVE+EXE was associated with 1.99 QALYs and total direct costs of $258,648 over 10 years. The incremental cost per QALY of EVE+EXE was $139,740 compared with EXE, $157,749 compared with FUL, and $115,624 compared with TAM.

14134,Cost-effectiveness of screening for HLA-A*31:01 prior to initiation of carbamazepine in epilepsy,"OBJECTIVE: Carbamazepine causes severe cutaneous adverse drug reactions that may be predicted by the presence of the HLA-A*31:01 allele in northern European populations. There is uncertainty as to whether routine testing of patients with epilepsy is cost-effective. We conducted an economic evaluation of HLA-A*31:01 testing from the perspective of the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A short-term, decision analytic model was developed to estimate the outcomes and costs associated with a policy of routine testing (with lamotrigine prescribed for patients who test positive) versus the current standard of care, which is carbamazepine prescribed without testing. A Markov model was used to estimate total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) over a lifetime to account for differences in drug effectiveness and the long-term consequences of adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: Testing reduced the expected rate of cutaneous adverse drug reactions from 780 to 700 per 10,000 patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for pharmacogenetic testing versus standard care was pound12,808 per QALY gained. The probability of testing being cost-effective at a threshold of pound20,000 per QALY was 0.80, but the results were sensitive to estimated remission rates for alternative antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). SIGNIFICANCE: Routine testing for HLA-A*31:01 in order to reduce the incidence of cutaneous adverse drug reactions in patients being prescribed carbamazepine for epilepsy is likely to represent a cost-effective use of health care resources.",2015-01-17934,26046144,Epilepsia,Catrin O Plumpton,2015,56 / 4,556-63,No,26046144,"Catrin O Plumpton; Vincent L M Yip; Ana Alfirevic; Anthony G Marson; Munir Pirmohamed; Dyfrig A Hughes; Cost-effectiveness of screening for HLA-A*31:01 prior to initiation of carbamazepine in epilepsy, Epilepsia, 2015 Apr; 56(4):0013-9580; 556-63",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening for the hla-a*31:01 allele prior to initiating carbamazepine or lamotrigine treatment vs. Standard/Usual Care- No screening of the HLA-A*31:01 prior to treatment,"Local-onset, newly diagnosed, failed treatment with previous monotherapy",Not Stated,19 Years,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,12808,United Kingdom,2011,23642.07
14135,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy compared with cognitive-behavioural therapy and combination therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in the UK,"BACKGROUND: The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales recommends the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for the treatment of moderate to severe depression. However, the cost-effectiveness analysis on which these recommendations are based has not included psychotherapy as monotherapy as a potential option. For this reason, we aimed to update, augment and refine the existing economic evaluation. METHOD: We constructed a decision analytic model with a 27-month time horizon. We compared pharmacotherapy with cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and combination treatment for moderate to severe depression in secondary care from a healthcare service perspective. We reviewed the literature to identify relevant evidence and, where possible, synthesized evidence from clinical trials in a meta-analysis to inform model parameters. RESULTS: The model suggested that CBT as monotherapy was most likely to be the most cost-effective treatment option above a threshold of pound22 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). It dominated combination treatment and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound20 039 per QALY compared with pharmacotherapy. There was significant decision uncertainty in the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous NICE guidance, the results indicated that even for those patients for whom pharmacotherapy is acceptable, CBT as monotherapy may be a cost-effective treatment option.

14136,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy compared with cognitive-behavioural therapy and combination therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in the UK,"BACKGROUND: The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales recommends the combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy for the treatment of moderate to severe depression. However, the cost-effectiveness analysis on which these recommendations are based has not included psychotherapy as monotherapy as a potential option. For this reason, we aimed to update, augment and refine the existing economic evaluation. METHOD: We constructed a decision analytic model with a 27-month time horizon. We compared pharmacotherapy with cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and combination treatment for moderate to severe depression in secondary care from a healthcare service perspective. We reviewed the literature to identify relevant evidence and, where possible, synthesized evidence from clinical trials in a meta-analysis to inform model parameters. RESULTS: The model suggested that CBT as monotherapy was most likely to be the most cost-effective treatment option above a threshold of pound22 000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). It dominated combination treatment and had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pound20 039 per QALY compared with pharmacotherapy. There was significant decision uncertainty in the probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previous NICE guidance, the results indicated that even for those patients for whom pharmacotherapy is acceptable, CBT as monotherapy may be a cost-effective treatment option. However, this conclusion was based on a limited evidence base, particularly for combination treatment. In addition, this evidence cannot easily be transferred to a primary care setting.",2015-01-17943,26040631,Open Forum Infect Dis,L Koeser,2015,/,1-13,No,26040631,"L Koeser; V Donisi; D P Goldberg; P McCrone; Modelling the cost-effectiveness of pharmacotherapy compared with cognitive-behavioural therapy and combination therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in the UK, Open Forum Infect Dis, 2015 Aug 3; ():2328-8957; 1-13",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Cognitive-behavioural therapy (cbt), monotherapy as first line treatment vs. Pharmacotherapy monotherapy, 20 mg daily dose Citalopram over 15 months as first line treatment",Moderate or severe major depressive disorder (MDD),Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,27 Months,3.50,3.50,20039,United Kingdom,2012,35810.99
14137,"Cost-Effectiveness of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Elderly Patients with Multiple Myeloma using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Database","In the past decade, the number of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplants (Auto HSCT) for older patients with multiple myeloma (MM) has increased dramatically, as has the cost of transplantation. The cost-effectiveness of this modality in patients over age 65 is unclear. Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to create a propensity-score matched sample of patients over age 65 between 2000 and 2007, we compared the survival and cost for those who received Auto HSCT to those who did not undergo transplantation but survived at least 6 months after diagnosis, and we calculated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Two hundred seventy patients underwent transplantation. Median overall survival from diagnosis in those who underwent transplantation was significantly longer than in patients who did not (58 months versus 37 months, P < .001). For patients living longer than 2 years, the median monthly cost during the first year was significantly different, but the middle and last year of life costs were similar. The median cost of the first 100 days after transplantation was $60,000 (range, $37,000 to $85,000). The resultant ICER was $72,852 per life-year gained. Survival after transplantation was comparable to that in those who underwent transplantation patients under 65 years and significantly longer than older patients who did not undergo transplantation. With an ICER less than $100,000/life-year gained, Auto HSCT is cost-effective when compared with nontransplantation care in the era of novel agents and should be considered, where clinically indicated, for patients over the age of 65.",2015-01-17955,26033281,J Neurosurg,Gunjan L Shah,2015,21 / 10,1823-9,No,26033281,"Gunjan L Shah; Aaron N Winn; Pei-Jung Lin; Andreas Klein; Kellie A Sprague; Hedy P Smith; Rachel Buchsbaum; Joshua T Cohen; Kenneth B Miller; Raymond Comenzo; Susan K Parsons; Cost-Effectiveness of Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Elderly Patients with Multiple Myeloma using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare Database, J Neurosurg, 2015 Oct; 21(10):1933-0693; 1823-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation vs. no transplantation with 6 months survival after diagnosis,"enrolled in Medicare part A and B fee-for-service plan during 1 year before or after diagnosis or until death, first cancer diagnosis",Not Stated,66 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2010,Not Stated
14138,Boceprevir for Chronic Genotype 1 Hepatitis C Virus in the Current Health Care Setting in Greece: A Cost-effectiveness Analysis,"PURPOSE: Boceprevir, as an add-on to the standard of care (SOC) for chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (G1 HCV), pegylated interferon + ribavirin for 48 weeks (PEG + RBV), has been reported to have a clinical profile superior to that of SOC alone. The objective of the present study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of triple therapy with PEG + RBV + boceprevir to that of SOC in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients with G1 HCV in Greece. METHODS: A Markov model that simulated the quality-adjusted life expectancy and corresponding costs of treating G1 HCV infection provided the basis of the analysis. Treatment strategies under consideration were those in the Phase III boceprevir trials: (1) boceprevir response-guided therapy (shortened treatment duration for early responders); (2) fixed-duration (4-week) SOC plus 44 weeks of triple therapy; and (3) 48-week SOC. Efficacy data and the baseline characteristics of the study population were based on data from the SPRINT-2 (Serine Protease Inhibitor Therapy 2) and RESPOND-2 (Retreatment with HCV Serine Protease Inhibitor Boceprevir and PegIntron/Rebetol 2) clinical trials. Health care resource utilization and costs reflect the local clinical setting, with a 3% discount per annum, and were assessed from a third-party payer perspective. FINDINGS: Triple therapy was projected to reduce liver complications (eg, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, need for liver transplantation, and liver-related death) by 44% to 45% and 49% to 53% in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients, respectively, over a lifetime horizon, leading to corresponding gains of 0.87 and 1.25 quality-adjusted life-years gained per patient. Taking into account the costs of medications, treatment, and outcomes management, the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of triple therapy versus SOC were euro10,003 and euro10,852 per quality-adjusted life-years gained in treatment-naive and treatment-experienced patients. Extensive sensitivity analyses suggested that the findings were robust over a wide range of inputs.

14140,Is antenatal screening for hepatitis C virus cost-effective? A decade's experience at a London centre,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of a routine universal antenatal hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening programme at a London centre. METHODS: Ten years' retrospective antenatal screening and outcome data informed a cost-effectiveness analysis using the previously validated MONARCH model. The cost and quality of life outcomes associated with the screening and treatment of newly identified hepatitis C cases were used to generate cost-effectiveness estimates for the screening programme. RESULTS: A total of 35,355 women were screened between 1st November 2003 and 1st March 2013; 136 women (0.38%) were found to be HCV antibody positive. Of 78 (0.22%) viraemic cases, 44 (0.12%) were newly diagnosed. In addition, the screening programme identified three (6.8%) vertical transmissions in children of newly diagnosed mothers. Of 16 newly diagnosed mothers biopsied, all were in the F0-F2 METAVIR disease stages, and 50% had HCV genotype 1. Postnatal treatment with pegylated interferon and ribavirin was initiated in 19 women, with 14 (74%) achieving sustained virologic response. The total cost of screening and confirmation of diagnoses was estimated to be pound240,641. This translates to pound5469 per newly diagnosed individual. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of this screening and treatment strategy was pound2400 per QALY gained. Treatment with newer direct-acting antiviral regimens would have a projected cost of pound9139 per QALY gained, well below the pound20,000-30,000/QALY gained willingness-to-pay threshold applied by policy advisory bodies.

14142,Cost-effectiveness of extended-release methylphenidate in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder sub-optimally treated with immediate release methylphenidate,"BACKGROUND: Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common psychiatric disorder in children and adolescents. Immediate-release methylphenidate (IR-MPH) is the medical treatment of first choice. The necessity to use several IR-MPH tablets per day and associated potential social stigma at school often leads to reduced compliance, sub-optimal treatment, and therefore economic loss. Replacement of IR-MPH with a single-dose extended release (ER-MPH) formulation may improve drug response and economic efficiency. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness from a societal perspective of a switch from IR-MPH to ER-MPH in patients who are sub-optimally treated. METHODS: A daily Markov-cycle model covering a time-span of 10 years was developed including four different health states: (1) optimal response, (2) sub-optimal response, (3) discontinued treatment, and (4) natural remission. ER-MPH options included methylphenidate osmotic release oral system (MPH-OROS) and Equasym XL/Medikinet CR. Both direct costs and indirect costs were included in the analysis, and effects were expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Univariate, multivariate as well as probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted and the main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: Switching sub-optimally treated patients from IR-MPH to MPH-OROS or Equasym XL/Medikinet CR led to per-patient cost-savings of euro4200 and euro5400, respectively, over a 10-year treatment span.

METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to evaluate long-term outcomes resulting from strategies using computed tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging, nonenhanced CT, or duplex ultrasound with intravenous (IV) thrombolysis being administered after positive findings. The analysis was performed from the societal perspective based on US recommendations. Input parameters were derived from the literature. Costs were obtained from United States costing sources and published literature. Outcomes were lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and net monetary benefits, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $80,000 per QALY. The strategy with the highest net monetary benefit was considered the most cost-effective. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the effect of varying parameter values. RESULTS: In the reference case analysis, CTA dominated all other imaging strategies. CTA yielded 0.02 QALYs more than magnetic resonance imaging and 0.04 QALYs more than duplex ultrasound followed by CTA.

14147,Different Imaging Strategies in Patients With Possible Basilar Artery Occlusion: Cost-Effectiveness Analysis,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different noninvasive imaging strategies in patients with possible basilar artery occlusion. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used to evaluate long-term outcomes resulting from strategies using computed tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging, nonenhanced CT, or duplex ultrasound with intravenous (IV) thrombolysis being administered after positive findings. The analysis was performed from the societal perspective based on US recommendations. Input parameters were derived from the literature. Costs were obtained from United States costing sources and published literature. Outcomes were lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and net monetary benefits, with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $80,000 per QALY. The strategy with the highest net monetary benefit was considered the most cost-effective. Extensive deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to explore the effect of varying parameter values. RESULTS: In the reference case analysis, CTA dominated all other imaging strategies. CTA yielded 0.02 QALYs more than magnetic resonance imaging and 0.04 QALYs more than duplex ultrasound followed by CTA. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $80,000 per QALY, CTA yielded the highest net monetary benefits. The probability that CTA is cost-effective was 96% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $80,000/QALY. Sensitivity analyses showed that duplex ultrasound was cost-effective only for a prior probability of </=0.02 and that these results were only minimally influenced by duplex ultrasound sensitivity and specificity.

14148,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a low-dose contraceptive levonorgestrel intrauterine system in Sweden,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a novel intrauterine system, levonorgestrel intrauterine system 13.5 mg vs. oral contraception, in women at risk of unintended pregnancy. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness model using efficacy and discontinuation data from published articles. SETTING: Societal perspective including direct and indirect costs. POPULATION: Women at risk of unintended pregnancy using reversible contraception. METHODS: An economic analysis was conducted by modeling the different health states of women using contraception over a 3-year period. Typical use efficacy rates from published articles were used to determine unintended pregnancy events. Discontinuation rates were used to account for method switching. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated in terms of the incremental cost per unintended pregnancy avoided. In addition, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year was calculated. RESULTS: Levonorgestrel intrauterine system 13.5 mg generated costs savings of euro 311,000 in a cohort of 1000 women aged 15-44 years. In addition, there were fewer unintended pregnancies (55 vs. 294) compared with women using oral contraception. CONCLUSION: Levonorgestrel intrauterine system 13.5 mg is a cost-effective method when compared with oral contraception. A shift in contraceptive use from oral contraception to long-acting reversible contraception methods could result in fewer unintended pregnancies, quality-adjusted life-year gains, as well as cost savings.",2015-01-17989,26015090,Codas,Nathaniel Henry,2015,94 / 8,884-90,No,26015090,"Nathaniel Henry; Charlie Hawes; Julia Lowin; Ingrid Lekander; Anna Filonenko; Helena K Kallner; Cost-effectiveness analysis of a low-dose contraceptive levonorgestrel intrauterine system in Sweden, Codas, 2015 Aug; 94(8):2317-1782; 884-90",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Levonorgestrel intrauterine system 13.5 mg vs. Standard/Usual Care- oral contraception,at risk of unintended pregnancy using reversible contraception,44 Years,15 Years,Female,Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,-228933.83,Euro,2013,-337800.74
14149,Economic Evaluation of Bevacizumab for the First-Line Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme,"PURPOSE: The Avastin in Glioblastoma trial has shown that patients newly diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treated with bevacizumab plus radiotherapy and temozolomide versus radiotherapy and temozolomide alone showed improvement in progression-free survival, possibly leading to a new indication for first-line use of bevacizumab in GBM. The cost-utility of this new intervention remains unknown; therefore, we developed a Markov model estimating the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) from a Canadian public payer perspective. METHODS: We incorporated trial data for state transitions and treatment effects from the Avastin in Glioblastoma trial, costs and resource use data from Canadian published studies and databases, and utility parameters from published literature. We addressed uncertainty through one-way deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, extended the model to lifetime horizon and by another arm to compare first-line versus second-line use of bevacizumab on progression, performed value of information analysis, and performed US costing sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Adding bevacizumab to radiotherapy and temozolomide resulted in increases of 0.13 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and $80,000 per patient over 2-year time horizon at the base case analysis. The ICUR was $607,966/QALY (95% CI, $305,000/QALY to $2,550,000/QALY), with 0% chance of being cost effective at the $100,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold and never going below $450,000/QALY in the one-way sensitivity analysis. The ICUR using the US costing data was $787,519/QALY. The lifetime ICUR was $439,764/QALY (95% CI, $235,000/QALY to $1,520,000/QALY), never going below $350,000/QALY in the sensitivity analysis. Second-line use of bevacizumab on progression is more effective and less expensive than its first-line use. Value of information analysis revealed that future research is unwarranted.

14150,Cost-Effectiveness of Intra-Arterial Treatment as an Adjunct to Intravenous Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator for Acute Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of intra-arterial treatment within the 0- to 6-hour window after intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator within 0- to 4.5-hour compared with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator alone, in the US setting and from a social perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic model estimated the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with the additional benefit of intra-arterial therapy compared with standard treatment with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator alone. Model inputs were obtained from published literature, the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Therapy for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN) study, and claims databases in the United States. Health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Treatment benefit was assessed by calculating the cost per QALY gained. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed to estimate the overall uncertainty of model results. RESULTS: The addition of intra-arterial therapy compared with standard treatment alone yielded a lifetime gain of 0.7 QALY for an additional cost of $9911, which resulted in a cost of $14 137 per QALY. Multivariable sensitivity analysis predicted cost-effectiveness (</=$50 000 per QALY) in 97.6% of simulation runs.

DESIGN: Economic evaluation carried out alongside the multi-centre, pragmatic, non-inferiority, randomised controlled Outpatient Polyp Treatment (OPT) trial. The UK National Health Service (NHS) perspective was used in the estimation of costs and the interpretation of results. SETTING: Thirty-one secondary care UK NHS hospitals between April 2008 and July 2011. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred and seven women with abnormal uterine bleeding and hysteroscopically diagnosed endometrial polyps. INTERVENTIONS: Outpatient uterine polypectomy versus standard inpatient treatment. Clinicians were free to choose the technique for polypectomy within the allocated setting. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-reported effectiveness of the procedure determined by the women's self-assessment of bleeding at 6 months, and QALY gains at 6 and 12 months. RESULTS: Inpatient treatment was slightly more effective but more expensive than outpatient treatment, resulting in relatively high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Intention-to-treat analysis of the base case at 6 months revealed that it cost an additional pound9421 per successfully treated patient in the inpatient group and pound 1,099,167 per additional QALY gained, when compared with outpatient treatment.

14153,Modelling the cost-effectiveness of public awareness campaigns for the early detection of non-small-cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Survival rates in lung cancer in England are significantly lower than in many similar countries. A range of Be Clear on Cancer (BCOC) campaigns have been conducted targeting lung cancer and found to improve the proportion of diagnoses at the early stage of disease. This paper considers the cost-effectiveness of such campaigns, evaluating the effect of both the regional and national BCOC campaigns on the stage distribution of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at diagnosis. METHODS: A natural history model of NSCLC was developed using incidence data, data elicited from clinical experts and model calibration techniques. This structure is used to consider the lifetime cost and quality-adjusted survival implications of the early awareness campaigns. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in terms of additional costs per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained are presented. Two scenario analyses were conducted to investigate the role of changes in the 'worried-well' population and the route of diagnosis that might occur as a result of the campaigns. RESULTS: The base-case theoretical model found the regional and national early awareness campaigns to be associated with QALY gains of 289 and 178 QALYs and ICERs of pound13 660 and pound18 173 per QALY gained, respectively. The scenarios found that increases in the 'worried-well' population may impact the cost-effectiveness conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Subject to the available evidence, the analysis suggests that early awareness campaigns in lung cancer have the potential to be cost-effective.

14155,Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy in Benign or Premalignant Pancreatic Lesions: Is It Really More Cost-Effective than Open Approach?,"BACKGROUND: Data regarding the quality of life in patients undergoing laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy are lacking and no studies have reported a real cost-effectiveness analysis of this surgical procedure. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the quality of life and the cost-effectiveness of a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with respect to an open distal pancreatectomy. METHODS: Forty-one patients who underwent a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and 40 patients who underwent an open distal pancreatectomy were retrospectively studied as regards postoperative results, quality of life and cost-effectiveness analysis. The Italian neutral version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire C-30, version 3.0, was used to rate the quality of life. RESULTS: Postoperative results were similar in the two groups; the only difference was that the first oral intake took place significantly earlier in the laparoscopic group than in the open group (P < 0.001). Regarding quality of life, the laparoscopic approach was able to ameliorate physical functioning (P = 0.049), role functioning (P = 0.044) and cognitive functioning (P = 0.030) and reduce the sleep disturbance scale (P = 0.050). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that the acceptability curve for a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy had a higher probability of being more cost-effective than an open distal pancreatectomy when a willingness to pay above 5400 Euros/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was accepted. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations of the study, laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy can be considered not only safe and feasible but also permits a better quality of life and is acceptable in terms of cost-effectiveness to Italian and European health care services.",2015-01-18015,26001367,J Gastrointest Surg,Claudio Ricci,2015,19 / 8,1415-24,No,26001367,"Claudio Ricci; Riccardo Casadei; Giovanni Taffurelli; Selene Bogoni; Marielda D'Ambra; Carlo Ingaldi; Nico Pagano; Carlo Alberto Pacilio; Francesco Minni; Laparoscopic Distal Pancreatectomy in Benign or Premalignant Pancreatic Lesions: Is It Really More Cost-Effective than Open Approach?, J Gastrointest Surg, 2015 Aug; 19(8):1091-255X; 1415-24",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy vs. open distal pancreatectomy,benign or low-grade malignant lesions of the pancreatic bodytail,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,5622,Euro,2013,8295.48

To improve the safety and efficacy of paclitaxel, an albumin-bound formulation (nab) is now available in the People's Republic of China (Abraxane((R))). To provide health economic data for the key stakeholders, a cost-utility analysis comparing nab-paclitaxel to docetaxel, both as alternatives to paclitaxel, was conducted. METHODS: A meta-analysis of clinical outcomes Phase III trials comparing nab-paclitaxel (260 mg/m(2) every [q] 3 weeks) or branded docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) q 3 weeks), to solvent-based branded paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) q 3 weeks) was undertaken to provide safety and clinical data. Resource use data for the delivery of anticancer therapy and for the treatment of grade 3/4 toxicity was collected from a time and motion study conducted in three Chinese cancer centers and from a survey of clinicians.

14158,Cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab versus aflibercept in the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema: a UK healthcare perspective,"BACKGROUND: Ranibizumab and aflibercept are alternative anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents approved for the treatment of visual impairment (VI) due to diabetic macular edema (DME). OBJECTIVE: To estimate, from a UK healthcare perspective, the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab 0.5 mg pro re nata (PRN) and ranibizumab 0.5 mg treat and extend (T&E) compared with aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks after five initial monthly doses (2q8) in the treatment of VI due to DME. METHODS: A Markov model previously reviewed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence was used to simulate the long-term outcomes and costs of treating DME. Health states were defined by increments of ten letters in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), with a 3-month cycle length. Patients could gain (or lose) a maximum of two health states between cycles. A 3-year treatment time frame and a lifetime horizon were used.

14159,Cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab versus aflibercept in the treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema: a UK healthcare perspective,"BACKGROUND: Ranibizumab and aflibercept are alternative anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agents approved for the treatment of visual impairment (VI) due to diabetic macular edema (DME). OBJECTIVE: To estimate, from a UK healthcare perspective, the cost-effectiveness of ranibizumab 0.5 mg pro re nata (PRN) and ranibizumab 0.5 mg treat and extend (T&E) compared with aflibercept 2 mg every 8 weeks after five initial monthly doses (2q8) in the treatment of VI due to DME. METHODS: A Markov model previously reviewed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence was used to simulate the long-term outcomes and costs of treating DME. Health states were defined by increments of ten letters in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), with a 3-month cycle length. Patients could gain (or lose) a maximum of two health states between cycles. A 3-year treatment time frame and a lifetime horizon were used. Future costs and health outcomes were discounted at 3.5% per annum. Patient baseline characteristics and the efficacy of ranibizumab PRN were derived using data from the RESTORE study.

14160,"Cost-effectiveness of abatacept, rituximab, and TNFi treatment after previous failure with TNFi treatment in rheumatoid arthritis: a pragmatic multi-centre randomised trial","INTRODUCTION: For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) whose treatment with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) is failing, several biological treatment options are available. Often, another TNFi or a biological with another mode of action is prescribed. The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of three biologic treatments with different modes of action in patients with RA whose TNFi therapy is failing. METHODS: We conducted a pragmatic, 1-year randomised trial in a multicentre setting. Patients with active RA despite previous TNFi treatment were randomised to receive abatacept, rituximab or a different TNFi. The primary outcome (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints) and the secondary outcomes (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index and 36-item Short Form Health Survey scores) were analysed using linear mixed models. Cost-effectiveness was analysed on the basis of incremental net monetary benefit, which was based on quality-adjusted life-years (calculated using EQ-5D scores), and all medication expenditures consumed in 1 year. All analyses were also corrected for possible confounders. RESULTS: Of 144 randomised patients, 5 were excluded and 139 started taking abatacept (43 patients), rituximab (46 patients) or a different TNFi (50 patients). There were no significant differences between the three groups with respect to multiple measures of RA outcomes. However, our analysis revealed that rituximab therapy is significantly more cost-effective than both abatacept and TNFi over a willingness-to-pay range of 0 to 80,000 euros. CONCLUSIONS: All three treatment options were similarly effective; however, when costs were factored into the treatment decision, rituximab was the best option available to patients whose first TNFi treatment failed.

14163,Cost-effectiveness of Lumbar Epidural Steroid Injections,"STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal CohortObjectives. To determine the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (cost/QALY) for lumbar epidural steroid injections (LESI). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Despite being a widely performed procedure, there are few studies evaluating the cost-effectiveness of LESIs. METHODS: Patients who had LESI between June 2012 and July 2013 with EQ-5D scores available before and after LESIs but before any surgical intervention were identified. Costs were calculated based on the Medicare Fee Schedule multiplied by the number of LESIs done between the two clinic visits. QALYs were calculated using the EQ-5D. RESULTS: Of 421 patients who had pre-LESI EQ-5D data, 323 (77%) had post-LESI data available;200 females, 123 males, mean age 59.2 +/- 14.2 years. Cost per LESI was $608, with most patients receiving three LESIs over one year (range 1 to 6). Mean QALY gained was 0.005. One hundred forty-five patients (45%) had a QALY gain (mean = 0.117) at a cost of $62,175/QALY gained, 127 (40%) had a loss in QALY (mean = -0.120) and 51 (15%) had no change in QALY. Fourteen of the 145 patients who improved, and 29 of the 178 patients that did not, have medical comorbidities that precluded surgery. Thirty-two (22%) of 131 patients without medical comorbidities who improved; and 57 (32%) of the 149 patients without medical comorbidities who did not improve subsequently had surgery (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: LESI may not be cost-effective in patients with lumbar degenerative disorders. For the 145 patients who improved, cost per QALY gained was acceptable at $62,175. However for the 178 patients with no gain or a loss in QALY, the economics are not reportable with a cost per QALY gained being theoretically infinite. Further studies are needed in order to identify specific patient populations that will benefit from LESI, as the economic viability of LESI requires improved patient selection.",2015-01-18024,25996536,Int J STD AIDS,Leah Y Carreon,2015,/,,No,25996536,"Leah Y Carreon; Kelly R Bratcher; Farah Ammous; Steven D Glassman; Cost-effectiveness of Lumbar Epidural Steroid Injections, Int J STD AIDS, 2015 May 20; ():1758-1052",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lumbar epidural steroid injections vs. before Lumbar Epidural Steroid Injections,Not Stated,88 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,249631,United States,2013,277335.51
14164,The cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment of medial unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis in younger patients: a computer model-based evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Surgical options for the management of medial compartment osteoarthritis of the varus knee include high tibial osteotomy, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, and total knee arthroplasty. We sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of high tibial osteotomy and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty as alternatives to total knee arthroplasty for patients fifty to sixty years of age. METHODS: We built a probabilistic state-transition computer model with health states defined by pain, postoperative complications, and subsequent surgical procedures. We estimated transition probabilities from published literature. Costs were determined from Medicare reimbursement schedules. Health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). We conducted analyses over patients' lifetimes from the societal perspective, with health and cost outcomes discounted by 3% annually. We used probabilistic sensitivity analyses to account for uncertainty in data inputs. RESULTS: The estimated discounted QALYs were 14.62, 14.63, and 14.64 for high tibial osteotomy, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, and total knee arthroplasty, respectively. Discounted total direct medical costs were $20,436 for high tibial osteotomy, $24,637 for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, and $24,761 for total knee arthroplasty (in 2012 U.S. dollars). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $231,900 per QALY for total knee arthroplasty and $420,100 per QALY for unicompartmental knee arthroplasty. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that, at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of $50,000 per QALY, high tibial osteotomy was cost-effective 57% of the time; total knee arthroplasty, 24%; and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, 19%. At a WTP threshold of $100,000 per QALY, high tibial osteotomy was cost-effective 43% of time; total knee arthroplasty, 31%; and unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, 26%. CONCLUSIONS: In fifty to sixty-year-old patients with medial unicompartmental knee osteoarthritis, high tibial osteotomy is an attractive option compared with unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. This finding supports greater utilization of high tibial osteotomy for these patients.

14166,Cost-Effectiveness of Proton Pump Inhibitor Co-Therapy in Patients Taking Aspirin for Secondary Prevention of Ischemic Stroke,"BACKGROUND: Low-dose aspirin (ASA) is effective for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke but can increase the risks of hemorrhagic stroke, upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), and dyspepsia. Prophylactic administration of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduces the risks of these digestive symptoms. We investigated the cost effectiveness of adding a PPI to ASA therapy for ischemic stroke patients in Japan. METHODS: A Markov state-transition model was developed to compare the cost effectiveness of ASA monotherapy with ASA plus PPI co-therapy in patients with histories of upper gastrointestinal ulcers and ischemic stroke. The model takes into account ASA adherence rate and adverse effects due to ASA, including hemorrhagic stroke and UGIB. The analysis was performed from the perspective of healthcare payers in 2013. RESULTS: In the base case, total life-years by PPI co-therapy and monotherapy were 16.005 and 15.932, respectively. The difference in duration of no therapy (no ASA or PPI) between the therapies was 558.5 days, which would prevent 30.3 recurrences of ischemic stroke per 1000 person-years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PPI co-therapy relative to monotherapy was yen1,191,665 (US$11,458) per life-year gained. In a one-way sensitivity analysis, PPI co-therapy was consistently cost effective at a willingness to pay of yen5,000,000 (US$48,077) per life-year gained. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the probability that PPI co-therapy was cost effective was 89.74 % at the willingness to pay. CONCLUSIONS: Co-therapy with ASA plus PPI appears to be cost-effective compared with ASA monotherapy. The addition of PPI also appeared to prolong the duration of ASA therapy, thereby reducing the risk of ischemic stroke.",2015-01-18030,25995130,G Ital Dermatol Venereol,Nobuyoshi Takabayashi,2015,33 / 10,1091-100,No,25995130,"Nobuyoshi Takabayashi; Kyoko Murata; Shiro Tanaka; Koji Kawakami; Cost-Effectiveness of Proton Pump Inhibitor Co-Therapy in Patients Taking Aspirin for Secondary Prevention of Ischemic Stroke, G Ital Dermatol Venereol, 2015 Oct; 33(10):0392-0488; 1091-100",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,Aspirin plus proton pump inhibitors co-therapy vs. aspirin monotherapy,"with histories of upper gastrointestinal ulcers and ischemic stroke, using low-dose aspirin for secondary prevention",Not Stated,55 Years,"Female, Male",Full,30 Years,2.00,2.00,Not Stated,Japan,2013,Not Stated
14167,Cost-utility analysis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis screening,"OBJECTIVES: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver disease in Western countries. No studies have examined the cost-effectiveness of screening its advanced form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis of annual noninvasive screening strategies using third-party payer perspective in a general population in comparison to screening a high-risk obese or diabetic population. Screening algorithms involved well-studied techniques, including NAFLD fibrosis score, transient elastography (TE), and acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging for detecting advanced fibrosis (>/= F3); and plasma cytokeratin (CK)-18 for NASH detection. Liver biopsy and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) were compared as confirmation methods. Canadian dollar (CAD or C$) costs were adjusted for inflation and discounted at 5 %. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of </=C$ 50,000 was considered cost-effective. RESULTS: Compared with no screening, screening with NAFLD fibrosis score/TE/CK-18 algorithm with MRE as confirmation for advanced fibrosis had an ICER of C$ 26,143 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Screening in high-risk obese or diabetic populations was more cost-effective, with an ICER of C$ 9,051 and C$ 7,991 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, respectively. Liver biopsy confirmation was not found to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that annual NASH screening in high-risk obese or diabetic populations can be cost-effective. KEY POINTS: * This cost-utility analysis suggests that screening for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis may be cost-effective. * In particular, screening of high-risk obese or diabetic populations is more cost-effective. * Magnetic resonance elastography was more cost-effective to confirm disease compared to biopsy. * More studies are needed to determine quality of life in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. * More management strategies for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis are also needed.",2015-01-18033,25994191,BMC Obes,Eric Zhang,2015,/,,No,25994191,"Eric Zhang; Claire Wartelle-Bladou; Luigi Lepanto; Jean Lachaine; Guy Cloutier; An Tang; Cost-utility analysis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis screening, BMC Obes, 2015 May 21; ():2052-9538",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Annual non-invasive screening with magnetic resonance elastography confirmation and vitamin e treatment vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,30 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,26143,Canada,2013,28208.87

14173,Cost-effectiveness of proton beam therapy for intraocular melanoma,"PURPOSE: Proton beam therapy is a commonly accepted treatment for intraocular melanomas, but the literature is lacking in descriptions of patient preferences of clinical outcomes and economic impact. In addition, no economic evaluations have been published regarding the incremental cost-effectiveness of proton beam therapy compared with enucleation or plaque brachytherapy, typical alternative treatments. We, therefore, conducted a cost-utility analysis of these three approaches for the treatment of intraocular melanomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Markov model was constructed. Model parameters were identified from the published literature and publicly available data sources. Cost-effectiveness of each treatment was calculated in 2011 US Dollars per quality-adjusted life-year. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated assuming enucleation as reference. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted on all model parameters. A decision threshold of $50,000/quality-adjusted life-year was used to determine cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Enucleation had the lowest costs and quality-adjusted life-years, and plaque brachytherapy had the highest costs and quality-adjusted life-years. Compared with enucleation, the base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for plaque brachytherapy and proton beam therapy were $77,500/quality-adjusted life-year and $106,100/quality-adjusted life-year, respectively. Results were highly sensitive to multiple parameters. All three treatments were considered optimal, and even dominant, depending on the values used for sensitive parameters. CONCLUSION: Base-case analysis results suggest enucleation to be optimal.

14175,Cost-effectiveness and public health benefit of secondary cardiovascular disease prevention from improved adherence using a polypill in the UK,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the public health and economic benefits of adherence to a fixed-dose combination polypill for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) in the UK. DESIGN: Markov-model-based cost-effectiveness analysis, informed by systematic reviews, which identified efficacy, utilities and adherence data inputs. SETTING: General practice in the UK. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a mean age of 64.7 years, most of whom are men with a recent or non-recent diagnosis of MI and for whom secondary preventive medication is indicated and well tolerated. INTERVENTION: Fixed-dose combination polypill (100 mg aspirin, 20 mg atorvastatin and 2.5, 5, or 10 mg ramipril) compared with multiple monotherapy. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: CV events prevented per 1000 patients; cost per life-year gained; and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The model estimates that for each 10% increase in adherence, an additional 6.7% fatal and non-fatal CV events can be prevented. In the base case, over 10 years, the polypill would improve adherence by approximately 20% and thereby prevent 47 of 323 (15%) fatal and non-fatal CV events per 1000 patients compared with multiple monotherapy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound8200 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses for the base-case assumptions showed an 81.5% chance of the polypill being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained compared with multiple monotherapy. In scenario analyses that varied structural assumptions, ICERs ranged between cost saving and pound21,430 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that some 450,000 adults are at risk of MI, a 10 percentage point uptake of the polypill could prevent 3260 CV events and 590 CV deaths over a decade.The polypill appears to be a cost-effective strategy to prevent fatal and non-fatal CV events in the UK.",2015-01-18036,25991449,BMJ Open,Virginia Becerra,2015,5 / 5,e007111,No,25991449,"Virginia Becerra; Alfredo Gracia; Kamal Desai; Seye Abogunrin; Sarah Brand; Ruth Chapman; Fernando Garcia Alonso; Valentin Fuster; Gines Sanz; Cost-effectiveness and public health benefit of secondary cardiovascular disease prevention from improved adherence using a polypill in the UK, BMJ Open , 2015; 5(5):2044-6055; e007111",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Fixed-dose combination polypill (100 mg aspirin, 20 mg atorvastatin and 2.5, 5, or 10 mg ramipril) vs. Multiple monotherapy",Not Stated,64.7 Years,64.7 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,8205,United Kingdom,2014,14786.62

A long-term health economic analysis for the UK,"AIMS: The aim of the analysis was to investigate whether insulin intensification, based on the use of intensive insulin regimens as recommended by the current standard of care in routine clinical practice, would be cost-effective for patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK. METHODS: Clinical data were derived from a retrospective analysis of 3185 patients with type 2 diabetes on basal insulin in The Health Improvement Network (THIN) general practice database. In total, 48% (614 patients) intensified insulin therapy, defined by adding bolus or premix insulin to a basal regimen, which was associated with a reduction in HbA1c and an increase in body mass index. Projections of clinical outcomes and costs (2011 GBP) over patients' lifetimes were made using a recently validated type 2 diabetes model. RESULTS: Immediate insulin intensification was associated with improvements in life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy and time to onset of complications versus no intensification or delaying intensification by 2, 4, 6, or 8 years. Direct costs were higher with the insulin intensification strategy (due to the acquisition costs of insulin).

14182,Economic evaluation of single-pill combination of indapamide and amlodipine in the treatment of arterial hypertension in the Polish setting,"BACKGROUND: Arterial hypertension is a common disorder that affects around 9 million adults in Poland. Single-pill combinations (SPCs) for the treatment of arterial hypertension have significant advantages over the free combinations, resulting in lower risk of cardiovascular events and lower consumption of medical resources. The current ESC/ESH 2013 guidelines for the first time recommend treatment with a combination of thiazide-like diuretic with calcium channel blocker. Currently, no such combination is reimbursed from public funds in Poland. AIM: To assess the economic value of treatment with SPC of indapamide and amlodipine (Tertens-AM(R)) for hypertensive patients compared with free combination therapy (FC), in the Polish setting. METHODS: As there are currently no published data directly estimating the additional effect of using indapamide + amlo-dipine SPC vs. FC, two extreme approaches are presented: with difference in effectiveness due to improved adherence to the treatment estimated from published studies on other molecules used in hypertension such as SPCs and FCs - the base-case approach (1); and assuming no difference of effectiveness or adherence between SPC and FC of indapamide and amlodipine - the conservative approach (2). Modelling was carried out based on the Markov process in lifetime horizon. In the base-case approach, with the difference in effectiveness between SPC and FC, it was assumed that the differences in compliance translate into the differences in systolic blood pressure. Patients' characteristics were correlated with the risk of events associated with cardiovascular disease, based on the prediction algorithms from the Framingham Heart Study. Costs were considered from a National Health Fund (NHF) perspective and NHF and patient's perspective, and therefore direct medical costs were only included. RESULTS: The treatment with SPC of indapamide and amlodipine in place of FC resulted in 7.6 additional days of life in full health and longer overall patient survival by 2.9 days. The replacement of FC with SPC would result in national savings from both NHF perspective and NHF and patient's perspective, irrespective of the assumption of the difference in adherence between SPC and FC. The savings would amount to 1.602-3.954 million PLN and 16.498-19.186 million PLN from NHF perspective and NHF and patient's perspective, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment with SPC of indapamide and amlodipine for hypertensive patients was found to be dominant over FC or at least less expensive than treatment with FC when the difference in effectiveness was neglected. The replacement of FC with SPC would result in savings from both NHF perspective and NHF and patient's perspective.",2015-01-18049,25987296,J Clin Periodontol,Pawel Kawalec,2015,73 / 9,768-80,No,25987296,"Pawel Kawalec; Przemyslaw Holko; Ewa Stawowczyk; Lukasz Borowiec; Krzysztof J Filipiak; Economic evaluation of single-pill combination of indapamide and amlodipine in the treatment of arterial hypertension in the Polish setting, J Clin Periodontol, 2015; 73(9):1600-051X; 768-80",QALY,Poland,Not Stated,Not Stated,Single-pill combinations (spcs) of indapamide and amlodipine vs. free combination therapy (FC),under hypertensive treatment,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,3.50,-3458.65,Poland,2014,-1201.11

We developed a Markov-based Monte Carlo microsimulation model to represent the ADR events in the lifetime of each patient. The base-case considered a 40-year-old patient. We measured health outcomes in life years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) and estimated costs using 2013 US$. In the base-case, one-time genetic testing had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $43 165 (95% confidence interval (CI) is ($42 769,$43 561)) per additional LY and $53 680 per additional QALY (95% CI is ($53 182,$54 179)), hence under the base-case one-time genetic testing is cost-effective. The ICER values were most sensitive to the average probability of death due to ADR, reduction in ADR rate due to genetic testing, mean ADR rate and cost of genetic testing.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 19 May 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.39.",2015-01-18050,25987241,Age Ageing,O Alagoz,2015,/,,No,25987241,"O Alagoz; D Durham; K Kasirajan; Cost-effectiveness of one-time genetic testing to minimize lifetime adverse drug reactions, Age Ageing, 2015 May 19; ():1468-2834",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pharmacogenomic testing vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,53680,United States,2013,59637.51

We compared the cost effectiveness of clopidogrel with that of aspirin in Chinese patients with recent IS or established PAD. METHODS: A discrete-event simulation was developed to evaluate the economic implications of secondary prevention with clopidogrel versus aspirin. All available evidence was derived from clinical studies. Costs from a Chinese healthcare perspective in 2013 US dollars and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were projected over patients' lifetimes. Uncertainties were addressed using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Compared with aspirin, clopidogrel yielded a marginally increased life expectancy by 0.46 and 0.21 QALYs at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $US5246 and $US9890 per QALY in patients with recent IS and established PAD, respectively. One-way sensitivity analyses showed that the evaluation of patients with PAD and recent IS was robust except for the parameter of patient age. Given a willingness-to-pay of $US19,877 per QALY gained, clopidogrel had a probability of 90 and 68% of being cost effective in the recent IS or established PAD subgroups compared with aspirin, respectively.

14186,Cost-effectiveness of coronary CT angiography in patients with chest pain: Comparison with myocardial single photon emission tomography,"BACKGROUND: Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) has been proven accurate and is incorporated in clinical recommendations for coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosis workup, but cost-effectiveness data, especially in comparison to other methods such as myocardial single photon emission CT (SPECT) are insufficient. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of CCTA and myocardial SPECT in a real-world setting. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study on consecutive patients with suspected CAD and a pretest probability between 10% and 90%. Test accuracy was compared by correcting referral bias to coronary angiography depending on noninvasive test results based on the Bayes' theorem and also by incorporating 1-year follow-up results. Cost-effectiveness was analyzed using test accuracy and quality-adjusted life year (QALY). The model using diagnostic accuracy used the number of patients accurately diagnosed among 1000 persons as the effect and contained only expenses for diagnostic testing as the cost. In the model using QALY, a decision tree was developed, and the time horizon was 1 year. RESULTS: CCTA was performed in 635 patients and SPECT in 997 patients. An accurate diagnosis per 1000 patients was achieved in 725 patients by CCTA vs 661 patients by SPECT. In the model using diagnostic accuracy, CCTA was more effective and less expensive than SPECT ($725.38 for CCTA vs $661.46 for SPECT). In the model using QALY, CCTA was generally more effective in terms of life quality (0.00221 QALY) and cost ($513) than SPECT. However, cost utility varied among subgroups, with SPECT outperforming CCTA in patients with a pretest probability of 30% to 60% (0.01890 QALY; $113).

14187,Cost-effectiveness analysis of interferon beta-1b as treatment for patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis in Spain,"INTRODUCTION: The BENEFIT study has demonstrated the benefits of early treatment with interferon beta 1b (IFNbeta-1b). The objective of this study was to estimate the efficiency of early vs delayed IFNbeta-1b treatment in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Spain. METHODS: A Markov model reflecting the social perspective was developed with time horizons ranging from 2 years to lifetime. A cohort of 1000 patients with CIS, whose health status had been measured on the Expanded Disability Symptom Scale (EDSS), included patients who received early IFNbeta-1b treatment and those who did not. Data from the BENEFIT study were used to model EDSS progression and transitions to MS. Costs were estimated from published literature. Patient utilities were derived from EQ-5D data and published data. Mortality was estimated using life tables and EDSS data. Costs (euro at 2013 rates) and outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: In the base case, both the incremental cost utility ratio (ICUR) and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IFNbeta-1b versus no treatment were dominant (more effective and less costly) from a social perspective. From the perspective of the Spanish Health System, the ICUR was euro 40,702/QALY and the ICER was euro 13/relapse avoided. CONCLUSION: Early treatment with IFNbeta-1b after a CIS versus delayed treatment is efficient from a social perspective, but it may not be efficient from the perspective of the NHS which does not take non health-related costs into account.",2015-01-18070,25976942,Biostatistics,C Pinol,2015,/,,No,25976942,"C Pinol; Cost-effectiveness analysis of interferon beta-1b as treatment for patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis in Spain, Biostatistics, 2015 May 11; ():1468-4357",QALY,Spain,Not Stated,Not Stated,Received disease-modifying treatment with interferon beta-1b (250mg every orther day) right after a clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of multiple sclerosis vs. received disease-modifying treatment with interferon beta-1b (250mg every orther day) at the onset of clinically definite multiple sclerosis,clinically isolated syndrome suggestive multiple sclerosis,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-13378.38,Euro,2013,-19740.32
