33501,Cost-effectiveness of FRAX®-based intervention thresholds for management of osteoporosis in Singaporean women,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of FRAX® intervention thresholds (ITs) in Singaporean women > 50 years of age showed that generic alendronate was cost-effective at age-dependent major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) IT from the ages of 65 years for both full and real-world adherence whilst hip fracture (HF) ITs were cost-effective from the ages of 60 and 65 years. Alendronate was cost-effective irrespective of age only at fixed MOF IT of 14% and HF IT of 3.5%. INTRODUCTION: FRAX®-based intervention thresholds (ITs) were recently identified for osteoporosis management in Singapore. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of ITs in Singaporean women over the age of 50 years. METHODS: A validated Markov microsimulation model was used to estimate the lifetime healthcare costs (SGD2019) per quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) of generic alendronate compared with no treatment. Cost-effectiveness of age-dependent FRAX® major osteoporotic fracture (MOF) and hip fracture (HF) ITs was explored. In addition, ITs that would lead to cost-effectiveness were computed. Fracture incidence and cost data were obtained from the Ministry of Health and a previously published Singaporean study. A cost-effectiveness threshold of SGD 62,500/QALY gained was used, based conservatively on 0.7 times the Singapore GDP per capita. RESULTS: Generic alendronate was shown to be cost-effective at MOF ITs from the ages of 65 years, while HF ITs were cost-effective from the ages of 60 and 65 years, assuming full and real-world adherence, respectively. A 14% MOF and a 3.5% HF ITs were required for alendronate to be cost-effective above 50 years. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the treatment of Singaporean women with alendronate is cost-effective at age-dependant FRAX® intervention thresholds at 65 years and older. Furthermore, identifying women at any age above 50 years with a 10-year risk of MOF or HF of 14% or 3.5% would lead to efficient use of resources.

A cost-effectiveness threshold of SGD 62,500/QALY gained was used, based conservatively on 0.7 times the Singapore GDP per capita. RESULTS: Generic alendronate was shown to be cost-effective at MOF ITs from the ages of 65 years, while HF ITs were cost-effective from the ages of 60 and 65 years, assuming full and real-world adherence, respectively. A 14% MOF and a 3.5% HF ITs were required for alendronate to be cost-effective above 50 years. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that the treatment of Singaporean women with alendronate is cost-effective at age-dependant FRAX® intervention thresholds at 65 years and older. Furthermore, identifying women at any age above 50 years with a 10-year risk of MOF or HF of 14% or 3.5% would lead to efficient use of resources.

We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Singapore''s national mammography screening program, implemented in 2002, recommending annual screening between ages 40-49 and biennial screening between ages 50-69, and alternative screening scenarios taking into account important country-specific factors. Methods We used national data from Singapore in the MIcrosimulation SCreening ANalysis-Fatal diameter (MISCAN-Fadia) model to simulate 302 screening scenarios for 10 million women born between 1910-1969. Screening scenarios varied by starting and ending age, screening interval and attendance. Outcome measures included: life-years gained (LYG), breast cancer deaths averted, false positives, overdiagnosis, Quality-Adjusted-Life-Years (QALYs), costs (in 2002 Singapore dollars; S$), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Costs and effects were calculated and discounted with 3% using a health-care provider''s perspective. Results Singapore''s current screening program at observed attendance levels required 54,158 mammograms per 100,000 women, yielded 1,054 LYG and averted 57 breast-cancer deaths. At attendance rates {greater than or equal to}50%, the current program was near the efficiency frontier. Most scenarios on the efficiency frontier started screening at age 40. The ICERs of the scenarios on the efficiency frontiers ranged between S$10,186-S$56,306/QALY, which is considered cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of S$70,000/QALY gained.

33523,Filtering for the best policy: An economic evaluation of policy options for kidney replacement coverage in the Philippines,"AIM: Kidney failure patients in the Philippines have free choice on their kidney replacement therapy (KRT), with a majority choosing haemodialysis (HD) over peritoneal dialysis (PD) and transplantation despite the inadequate coverage of HD. Although national health insurance coverage is limited, KRT remains to be one of the top benefits pay-outs in the country. The study aims to identify the most cost-effective policy strategy for financing KRT in the Philippines, in the context of a universal healthcare policy. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to estimate and compare the costs and benefits of different policy options with the comparator being partial HD coverage. Direct medical, non-medical and indirect costs were measured, while outcomes were reported through quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Parameters were derived from the kidney disease registry, hospital statistics from a tertiary hospital and a patient survey. RESULTS: The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis showed that shifting to a PD-First policy provides better value-for-money with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 570?029 Philippine Pesos (PHP) per QALY gained, compared with the ICER of the PD-First combined with pre-emptive transplant option of 577?989 PHP per QALY gained.

33526,Community health workers to improve adherence to anti-seizure medication in rural South Africa: Is it cost-effective?,"OBJECTIVE: Epilepsy is a common, chronic neurological disorder that disproportionately affects individuals living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where the treatment gap remains high and adherence to medication remains low. Community health workers (CHWs) have been shown to be effective at improving adherence to chronic medications, yet no study assessing the costs of CHWs in epilepsy management has been reported. METHODS: Using a Markov model with age- and sex-varying transition probabilities, we determined whether deploying CHWs to improve epilepsy treatment adherence in rural South Africa would be cost-effective. Data were derived using published studies from rural South Africa. Official statistics and international disability weights provided cost and health state values, respectively, and health gains were measured using quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The intervention was estimated at International Dollars ($) 123 250 per annum per sub-district community and cost $1494 and $1857 per QALY gained for males and females, respectively. Assuming a costlier intervention and lower effectiveness, cost per QALY was still less than South Africa''s Gross Domestic Product per capita of $13 215, the cost-effectiveness threshold applied. SIGNIFICANCE: CHWs would be cost-effective and the intervention dominated even when costs and effects of the intervention were unfavorably varied. Health system re-engineering currently underway in South Africa identifies CHWs as vital links in primary health care, thereby ensuring sustainability of the intervention.

33533,Cost-effectiveness of CYP2C19-guided antiplatelet therapy for acute coronary syndromes in Singapore,"We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a genotype-guided strategy among patients with acute coronary syndromes using a decision-tree model based on the Singapore healthcare payer''s perspective over a 1-year time horizon. Three dual antiplatelet strategies were considered: universal clopidogrel, genotype-guided, and universal ticagrelor. The prevalence of loss-of-function alleles was assumed to be 61.7% and model inputs were identified from the literature. Our primary outcome of interest was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) compared to universal clopidogrel. Both genotype-guided (72,158 SGD/QALY) and universal ticagrelor (82,269 SGD/QALY) were considered cost-effective based on a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of SGD 88,991. In our secondary analysis, the ICER for universal ticagrelor was 114,998 SGD/QALY when genotype-guided was taken as a reference. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that genotype-guided was the most cost-effective strategy when the WTP threshold was between SGD 70,000 to 100,000.

33541,Effectiveness of Levoamlodipine Maleate for Hypertension Compared with Amlodipine Besylate: a Pragmatic Comparative Effectiveness Study,"PURPOSE: Antihypertensive treatment is the most important method to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients. However, there is scant evidence of the benefits of levoamlodipine maleate for antihypertensive treatment using a head-to-head comparison in the real-world. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of levoamlodipine maleate used to treat outpatients with primary hypertension compared with amlodipine besylate in a real-world setting. METHODS: This was a pragmatic comparative effectiveness study carried out at 110 centers across China in outpatients with primary hypertension treated with levoamlodipine maleate or amlodipine besylate, with 24 months of follow-up. The primary outcomes used for evaluating the effectiveness were composite major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), adverse reactions, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: Among the included 10,031 patients, there were 482 MACCE, 223 (4.4%) in the levoamlodipine maleate group (n?=?5018) and 259 (5.2%) in the amlodipine besylate group (n?=?5013) (adjusted hazard ratio?=?0.90, 95%CI: 0.75-1.08, P?=?0.252). The levoamlodipine maleate group had lower overall incidences of any adverse reactions (6.0% vs. 8.4%, P?<?0.001), lower extremity edema (1.1% vs. 3.0%, P?<?0.001) and headache (0.7% vs. 1.1%, P?=?0.045). There was a nearly 100% chance of the levoamlodipine maleate being cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of 150,000 Yuan per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, resulting in more QALYs (incremental QALYs: 0.00392) and cost savings (saving 2725 Yuan or 28.8% reduction in overall costs) per patient. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, levoamlodipine maleate could reduce cost by 29% with a similar MACCE incidence rate and lower occurrence of adverse reactions (especially edema and headache) compared with amlodipine besylate.

METHODS: From a societal and healthcare perspective, this retrospective cost-effectiveness analysis analysed a cohort of 58 patients with FECD receiving pDMEK (n=38) or n-pDMEK (n=30) from 2016 to 2018 in the Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA. Exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgeries (other than uncomplicated cataract surgery), including other keratoplasty procedures, ocular pathological conditions as glaucoma, amblyopia, laser treatments, or any retinal or corneal disease. The main outcome parameters were the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) and net monetary benefit (NMB). RESULTS: pDMEK was less costly compared with n-pDMEK (healthcare: $13?886 vs $15?329; societal: $20?805 vs $22?262), with a slighter greater utility (QALY 0.6682 vs QALY 0.6640) over a time horizon of 15 years. pDMEK offered a slightly higher clinical effectiveness (+0.0042 QALY/patient) at a lower cost (healthcare: -$1444 per patient; societal: -$1457 per patient) in improving visual acuity in this cohort of patients with FECD. pDMEK achieved a favourable ICUR and NMB compared with n-pDMEK. Based on sensitivity analyses performed, the economic model was robust. CONCLUSIONS: From the societal and healthcare perspective, pDMEK was less costly and generated comparable utility values relative to n-pDMEK.

33544,Economic Evaluation of a New Polygenic Risk Score to Predict Nephropathy in Adult Patients With Type 2 Diabetes,"OBJECTIVES: The current screening method for diabetic nephropathy (DN) is based on detection of albumin in the urine and decline of glomerular filtration rate. The latter usually occurs relatively late in the course of the disease. A polygenic risk score (PRS) was recently developed for early prediction of the risk for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) to develop DN. The aim of this study was to assess the economic impact of the implementation of the PRS for early prediction of DN in patients with T2D compared with usual screening methods in Canada. METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was developed using a Markov model. Health states include pre-end-stage renal disease (ESRD), ESRD and death. Model efficacy parameters were based on prediction of outcome data by polygenic risk testing of the genotyped participants in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease PreterAx and DiamicronN Controlled Evaluation trial. Analyses were conducted from Canadian health-care and societal perspectives. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess results robustness. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, the PRS was a dominant strategy, from both a health-care system and societal perspective. The PRS was less expensive and more efficacious in terms of quality-adjusted life-years compared with usual screening technics. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that results remained dominant in most simulations.

BACKGROUND: In our previous study, we found MRM to be a specific diagnostic tool with high accuracy in patients with dense breasts representing a patient collective at intermediate risk of breast cancer. For this study, we examined whether MRM is an economical alternative. METHODS: For the determination of outcomes and costs, a decision model based on potential diagnostic results of MRM was developed. Quality of life was estimated in a Markov chain model distinguishing between the absence of malignancy, the presence of malignancy, and death. Input parameters were utilized from the prospective TK-Study. To investigate the economic impact of MRM, overall costs in € and outcomes of MRM in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated. A deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed. RESULTS: MRM was associated with expected costs of 1650.48 € in the 5-year period and an expected cumulative outcome of 4.69 QALYs. A true positive diagnosis resulted in significantly lower costs and a higher quality of life when compared to the consequences of a false negative result. In the deterministic sensitivity analysis, treatment costs had more impact on overall costs than the costs of MRM. The total costs per patient remained below 2500 € in the 5-year period. CONCLUSION: MRM, as a solitary imaging tool in patients at intermediate risk due to dense breasts, is economically feasible. KEY POINTS: • In patients with dense breasts (i.e., patients at intermediate risk of breast cancer), the relative cost of MR-mammography examinations only had moderate impact on overall costs. • This is due to cost-savings through the application of a sensitive imaging technique resulting in an optimized staging and therapy planning. • MR-mammography, unaccompanied by mammography or ultrasound in patients with dense breasts, was economically feasible in our analysis.",2021-01-35149,32856166,Eur Radiol,Matthias F Froelich,2021,31 / 2,967-974,No,32856166,"Matthias F Froelich; Clemens G Kaiser; Cost-effectiveness of MR-mammography as a solitary imaging technique in women with dense breasts: an economic evaluation of the prospective TK-Study, Eur Radiol , 2021 Feb; 31(2):1432-1084; 967-974",QALY,Germany,"Abnormal findings on diagnostic imaging and in function studies, without diagnosis","Diagnostic, Medical Device, Screening",True positive Magnetic Resonance mammography vs. False negative Magnetic Resonance mammography,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,Female,Full,"5 Years, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,-14792.84,Euro,2019,-17562.37

This study aimed to determine the cost-utility of add-on dapagliflozin treatment for HFrEF. METHODS: An analytical decision model was constructed to assess lifetime costs and outcomes from a healthcare system perspective. The cohort comprised HFrEF patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) =40%, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-IV with an average age of 65 years. Clinical inputs were derived from the results of the Dapagliflozin and Prevention of Adverse-Outcomes in Heart Failure (DAPA-HF) trial. Risk of non-cardiovascular death data, readmission rate data, and treatment-related cost data were based on Thai population. The outcomes and costs were discounted at 3% annually. A series of sensitivity analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: The increased cost of dapagliflozin add-on treatment from 17,442 THB (559 USD) to 54,405 THB (1745 USD) was associated with a QALY gain from 6.33 to 6.92 compared to standard therapy, yielding an ICER of 62,090 THB/QALY (1991 USD/QALY). Sensitivity analyses revealed that the addition of dapagliflozin to the standard treatment demonstrated an 87% cost-effectiveness strategy at a level of willingness to pay (WTP) of 160,000 THB/QALY (5131 USD/QALY). ICER was higher in non-diabetes compared to diabetes (68,304 vs 47,613 THB/QALY or 2191 vs 1527 USD/QALY).

33549,Cost-effectiveness of a stepwise cardiometabolic disease prevention program: results of a randomized controlled trial in primary care,"BACKGROUND: Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) are the major cause of death worldwide and are associated with a lower quality of life and high healthcare costs. To prevent a further rise in CMD and related healthcare costs, early detection and adequate management of individuals at risk could be an effective preventive strategy. The objective of this study was to determine long-term cost-effectiveness of stepwise CMD risk assessment followed by individualized treatment if indicated compared to care as usual. A computer-based simulation model was used to project long-term health benefits and cost-effectiveness, assuming the prevention program was implemented in Dutch primary care. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting in which 1934 participants aged 45-70?years without recorded CMD or CMD risk factors participated. The intervention group was invited for stepwise CMD risk assessment through a risk score (step 1), additional risk assessment at the practice in case of increased risk (step 2) and individualized follow-up treatment if indicated (step 3). The control group was not invited for risk assessment, but completed a health questionnaire. Results of the effectiveness analysis on systolic blood pressure (-?2.26?mmHg; 95% CI -?4.01: -?0.51) and total cholesterol (-?0.15?mmol/l; 95% CI -?0.23: -?0.07) were used in this analysis. Outcome measures were the costs and benefits after 1-year follow-up and long-term (60?years) cost-effectiveness of stepwise CMD risk assessment compared to no assessment. A computer-based simulation model was used that included data on disability weights associated with age and disease outcomes related to CMD. Analyses were performed taking a healthcare perspective. RESULTS: After 1 year, the average costs in the intervention group were 260 Euro higher than in the control group and differences were mainly driven by healthcare costs. No meaningful change was found in EQ 5D-based quality of life between the intervention and control groups after 1-year follow-up (-?0.0154; 95% CI -?0.029: 0.004). After 60?years, cumulative costs of the intervention were 41.4 million Euro and 135 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were gained. Despite improvements in blood pressure and cholesterol, the intervention was not cost-effective (ICER of 306,000 Euro/QALY after 60?years). Scenario analyses did not allow for a change in conclusions with regard to cost-effectiveness of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of this primary care-based CMD prevention program is not cost-effective in the long term. Implementation of this program in primary care cannot be recommended.

33550,Cost-Effectiveness of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in Diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease in the Australian Health Care System,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major public health problem in Australia and globally. A variety of imaging techniques allow for both anatomical and functional assessment of CAD and selection of the optimal investigation pathway is challenging. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is not widely used in Australia, partly due to perceived cost and lack of Federal Government reimbursement compared to the alternative techniques. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic strategies in identifying significant CAD in patients with chest pain suggestive of angina using the evidence gathered in the Clinical Evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Coronary Heart Disease 2 (CE-MARC trial), analysed from the Australian health care perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic model coupled with three distinct Markov models allowed eight potential clinical investigation strategies to be considered; combinations of exercise electrocardiogram stress testing (EST), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), stress CMR, and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Costs were from the Australian health care system in Australian dollars, and outcomes were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years. Parameter estimates were derived from the CE-MARC and EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in patients with stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) trials, and from reviews of the published literature. RESULTS: The most cost-effective diagnostic strategy, based on a cost-effectiveness threshold of $45,000 to $75,000 per QALY gained, was EST, followed by stress CMR if the EST was positive or inconclusive, followed by ICA if the stress CMR was positive or inconclusive; this held true in the base case and the majority of scenario analyses.

33551,Cost-Effectiveness of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance in Diagnosing Coronary Artery Disease in the Australian Health Care System,"BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major public health problem in Australia and globally. A variety of imaging techniques allow for both anatomical and functional assessment of CAD and selection of the optimal investigation pathway is challenging. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is not widely used in Australia, partly due to perceived cost and lack of Federal Government reimbursement compared to the alternative techniques. The aim of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic strategies in identifying significant CAD in patients with chest pain suggestive of angina using the evidence gathered in the Clinical Evaluation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Coronary Heart Disease 2 (CE-MARC trial), analysed from the Australian health care perspective. METHODS: A decision analytic model coupled with three distinct Markov models allowed eight potential clinical investigation strategies to be considered; combinations of exercise electrocardiogram stress testing (EST), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), stress CMR, and invasive coronary angiography (ICA). Costs were from the Australian health care system in Australian dollars, and outcomes were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years. Parameter estimates were derived from the CE-MARC and EUropean trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in patients with stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) trials, and from reviews of the published literature. RESULTS: The most cost-effective diagnostic strategy, based on a cost-effectiveness threshold of $45,000 to $75,000 per QALY gained, was EST, followed by stress CMR if the EST was positive or inconclusive, followed by ICA if the stress CMR was positive or inconclusive; this held true in the base case and the majority of scenario analyses.

33552,Acceptability and Feasibility of a Mindfulness Intervention Delivered via Videoconferencing for People With Parkinson's,"Mindfulness-based group therapy is a rapidly growing psychological approach that can potentially help people adjust to chronic illness and manage unpleasant symptoms. Emerging evidence suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may benefit people with Parkinson''s. The objective of the paper is to examine the appropriateness, feasibility, and potential cost-effectiveness of an online mindfulness intervention, designed to reduce anxiety and depression for people with Parkinson''s. We conducted a feasibility randomized control trial and qualitative interviews. Anxiety, depression, pain, insomnia, fatigue, impact on daily activities and health-related quality of life were measured at baseline, 4, 8, and 20 weeks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted at the end of the intervention. Participants were randomized to the Skype delivered mindfulness group (n = 30) or wait-list (n = 30). Participants in the mindfulness group were also given a mindfulness manual and a CD with mindfulness meditations. The intervention did not show any significant effects in the primary or secondary outcome measures. However, there was a significant increase in the quality of life measure. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be £27,107 per Quality-Adjusted Life Year gained. Also, the qualitative study showed that mindfulness is a suitable and acceptable intervention. It appears feasible to run a trial delivering mindfulness through Skype, and people with Parkinson''s found the sessions acceptable and helpful.",2021-01-35077,33504245,J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol,Angeliki Bogosian,2021,/,891988720988901,No,33504245,"Angeliki Bogosian; Catherine S Hurt; John V Hindle; Lance M McCracken; Debora A Vasconcelos E Sa; Sandra Axell; Katy Tapper; Jemima Stevens; P Shashi Hirani; Marya Salhab; Wenrong Ye; Patricia Cubi-Molla; Acceptability and Feasibility of a Mindfulness Intervention Delivered via Videoconferencing for People With Parkinson's, J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol, 2021 Jan 28; ():0891-9887; 891988720988901",QALY,United Kingdom,Extrapyramidal and movement disorders,Health Education or Behavior,Mindfulness-based group therapy vs. Waitlist,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,27107,United Kingdom,2019,36687.08
33553,Cost-effectiveness of Surgical Treatment Pathways for Prolapse,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment pathways for apical prolapse. STUDY DESIGN: We constructed a stochastic Markov model to assess the cost-effectiveness of vaginal apical suspension, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, and robotic sacrocolpopexy. We modeled over 5 and 10 years, with 9 pathways accounting for up to 2 separate surgical repairs, recurrence of symptomatic apical prolapse, reoperation, and complications, including mesh excision. We calculated costs from the health care system''s perspective. RESULTS: Over 5 years, compared with expectant management, all surgical treatment pathways cost less than the willingness-to-pay threshold of US $50,000 per quality adjusted life-years. However, among surgical treatments, all but 2 pathways were dominated. Of the remaining 2, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy followed by vaginal repair for apical recurrence was not cost-effective compared with the vaginal-only approach (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER], >$500,000). Over 10 years, all but the same 2 pathways were dominated. However, starting with the laparoscopic approach in this case was more cost-effective with an ICER of US $6,176. If the laparoscopic approach was not available, starting with the robotic approach similarly became more cost-effective at 10 years (ICER, US $35,479). CONCLUSIONS: All minimally invasive surgical approaches for apical prolapse repair are cost-effective when compared with expectant management.

33564,The cost-effectiveness of schistosomiasis screening and treatment among recently resettled refugees to Canada: an economic evaluation,"BACKGROUND: Many refugees and asylum seekers from countries where schistosomiasis is endemic are infected with the Schistosoma parasite when they arrive in Canada. We assessed, from a systemic perspective, which of the following management strategies by health care providers is cost-effective: testing for schistosomiasis and treating if the individual is infected, treating presumptively or waiting for symptoms to emerge. METHODS: We constructed a decision-tree model to examine the cost-effectiveness of 3 management strategies: watchful waiting, screening and treatment, and presumptive treatment. We obtained data for the model from the literature and other sources, to predict deaths and chronic complications caused by schistosomiasis, as well as costs and net monetary benefit. RESULTS: Presumptive treatment was cost-saving if the prevalence of schistosomiasis in the target population was greater than 2.1%. In our baseline analysis, presumptive treatment was associated with an increase of 0.156 quality-adjusted life years and a cost saving of $405 per person, compared with watchful waiting. It was also more effective and less costly than screening and treatment.

33566,Cost-effectiveness analysis of the nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer in Singapore,"BACKGROUND: The nonavalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine has been shown to extend protection against oncogenic HPV types 31/33/45/52/58 (HPV-OV) not covered by the bivalent and quadrivalent HPV vaccines. Besides its clinical benefit, evidence on the economic value of the nonavalent vaccine is required to inform local vaccination strategies and funding decisions. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of replacing the bivalent vaccine with the nonavalent vaccine in the national school-based HPV vaccination programme in Singapore. METHODS: An existing age-structured dynamic transmission model coupled with stochastic individual-based simulations was adapted to project the health and economic impact of vaccinating 13-year-old girls with two doses of the nonavalent or bivalent HPV vaccines in Singapore. Direct costs (in Singapore dollars, S$) were obtained from public healthcare institutions in Singapore, while health state utilities were sourced from the literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated over a lifetime horizon, from a healthcare system perspective. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain the ICERs and corresponding variations across variable uncertainty. Particularly, this study tested the scenarios of lifelong and 20-year vaccine-induced protection, assumed 96.0% and 22.3% cross-protection against HPV-OV by nonavalent and bivalent vaccines respectively, and fixed vaccine prices per dose at S$188 for nonavalent and S$61.50 for bivalent vaccines. RESULTS: Compared with the bivalent vaccine, the use of the nonavalent vaccine was associated with an ICER of S$61,629 per quality-adjusted life year gained in the base case. The result was robust across a range of plausible input values, and to assumptions regarding the duration of vaccine protection. CONCLUSION: Given the high ICER, the nonavalent vaccine is unlikely to represent a cost-effective option compared with the bivalent vaccine for school-based HPV vaccination of 13-year old female students in Singapore. Substantial price reductions would be required to justify its inclusion in the school-based programme in the future.",2021-01-35151,33744050,Vaccine,Lee Cheng Phua,2021,/,,Yes,33744050,"Lee Cheng Phua; Horace C W Choi; Joseph Wu; Mark Jit; Jeffrey Low; Kwong Ng; Fiona Pearce; Cameron Hall; Mohamed Ismail Abdul Aziz; Cost-effectiveness analysis of the nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer in Singapore, Vaccine, 2021 Mar 16; ():1873-2518",QALY,Singapore,"Malignant neoplasms, breast and female genital organs",Immunization,Nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccine vs. Bivalent human papillomavirus vaccine,Students,13 Years,13 Years,Female,Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.00,3.00,69500,Singapore,2019,54005.97
33567,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of eliminating cervical cancer through a tailored optimal pathway: a modeling study,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Assembly has adopted a global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer. However, neither the optimal pathway nor the corresponding economic and health benefits have been evaluated. We take China as an example to assess the optimal pathway towards elimination and the cost-effectiveness of tailored actions. METHODS: A validated hybrid model was used to assess the costs and benefits of alternative strategies combining human papillomavirus vaccination, cervical screening, and treatment of pre-invasive lesions and invasive cancer for females with different immunization history. All Chinese females living or projected to be born during 2015-2100, under projected trends in aging, urbanization, and sexual activity, were considered. Optimal strategies were determined by cost-effectiveness efficiency frontiers. Primary outcomes were cervical cancer cases and deaths averted and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We employed a lifetime horizon from a societal perspective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluate model uncertainty. RESULTS: The optimal pathway represents an integration of multiple tailored strategies from females with different immunization history. If China adopts the optimal pathway, the age-standardized incidence of cervical cancer is predicted to decrease to fewer than four new cases per 100,000 women (i.e., elimination) by 2047 (95% confidence interval 2043 to 2050).

33570,The Cost-Effectiveness of Empagliflozin Versus Liraglutide Treatment in People with Type 2 Diabetes and Established Cardiovascular Disease.,"INTRODUCTION: The increasing financial burden associated with diabetes treatment presents a challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. Recently, clinical guidelines have focussed on patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and established cardiovascular disease (CVD) and recommend a sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor or a glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist as second-line treatment after metformin or independently of baseline glycated haemogloblin A1c (HbA1c). In Danish clinical guidelines, empagliflozin and liraglutide are highlighted owing to their positive impact on mortality. Thus, this study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of empagliflozin plus standard of care (SoC) versus liraglutide plus SoC in Danish patients with T2D and established CVD using a lifetime and 5-year horizon. METHODS: The IQVIA Core Diabetes Model (CDM) was calibrated to reproduce the clinical event rates observed in the cardiovascular outcome trial EMPA-REG OUTCOME. Network meta-analysis provided the relative risks for cardiovascular outcomes with empagliflozin versus liraglutide. Microvascular outcomes were predicted by standard CDM risk equations. The relative treatment effect was assumed for 9 years after which treatment was switched to basal-bolus therapy. The CDM was populated with Danish costs of events and drug costs at price-level 2019. Discounting of 4% was applied. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, CDM projected 9.858 and 9.667 life years, 6.162 and 5.976 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and DKK 478,026 (€64,079) and DKK 500,025 (€67,027) in total costs for empagliflozin plus SoC and liraglutide plus SoC, respectively. For a 5-year horizon, the results were 4.189 and 4.140 life years, 2.746 and 2.655 QALY, as well as DKK 123,413 (€16,543) and DKK 161,783 (€21,687), respectively.

33572,Cost Effectiveness of Digital Interventions for Generalised Anxiety Disorder: A Model-Based Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Digital interventions (DIs) are increasingly being used in mental health care, despite limited evidence regarding their value for money. This study aimed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of DIs for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD), in comparison with alternative care options, from the perspective of the UK health care system. METHODS: An open-source decision analytic cohort model was used to extrapolate the results of a network meta-analysis over a patient's lifetime and estimate the costs and outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years) of DIs and their comparators. The net monetary benefit (NMB) and probability of cost effectiveness was estimated for each comparator, and we conducted a Value of Information analysis to evaluate the scale and drivers of uncertainty. RESULTS: DIs were associated with lower NMB compared with medication and with group therapy, but greater NMB compared with non-therapeutic controls and with usual care. DIs that were supported by a clinician, an assistant or a lay person had higher delivery costs than purely patient-self-directed DIs, yielding a greater NMB when opportunity cost was above £3000/QALY. There was considerable uncertainty in the findings driven largely by uncertainty in the estimated treatment effects. The value of further research to establish the effectiveness of DIs for GAD was substantial, at least £12.9 billion.

DIs that were supported by a clinician, an assistant or a lay person had higher delivery costs than purely patient-self-directed DIs, yielding a greater NMB when opportunity cost was above £3000/QALY. There was considerable uncertainty in the findings driven largely by uncertainty in the estimated treatment effects. The value of further research to establish the effectiveness of DIs for GAD was substantial, at least £12.9 billion. CONCLUSIONS: The high uncertainty about these results does not allow for recommendations based on the cost effectiveness of DIs. However, the analysis highlights areas for future research, and demonstrates that apparent cost savings associated with DIs can be offset by reduced effectiveness.",2021-01-42473,34961911,Pharmacoecon Open,Dina Jankovic,2021,/,1-12,No,34961911,"Dina Jankovic; Pedro Saramago Goncalves; Lina Gega; David Marshall; Kath Wright; Meena Hafidh; Rachel Churchill; Laura Bojke; Cost Effectiveness of Digital Interventions for Generalised Anxiety Disorder: A Model-Based Analysis., Pharmacoecon Open, 2021 Dec 27; ():; 1-12",QALY,United Kingdom,Behavioural syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors,Care Delivery,usual care vs. selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,"mild, moderate, or severe",Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"Lifetime, Not Stated / None",3.50,3.50,-2397.22,United Kingdom,2019,-3244.44
33578,Value of Perampanel as Adjunctive Treatment for Partial-Onset Seizures in Epilepsy: Cost-Effectiveness and Budget Impact Analysis.,"Introduction: China has ~6 million patients with active epilepsy every year, around 60% of whom suffer from partial-onset seizures. Perampanel (PER) is a novel anti-epileptic drug for partial-onset seizures. PER has been included in the latest Chinese National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) in 2020. However, there is still a lack of evaluation evidence on the value of PER in China. Methods: This study selected a health system perspective. A Markov model was established to simulate the lifelong transition of different response levels and calculate the number of seizures in Chinese patients. Based on the utility value and mortality risk, the life years and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of patients using PER vs. lacosamide (LCM) were estimated. Efficacy data were derived from clinical trials and the literature. Cost data (in US dollars) included drug costs and medical service costs. A lifetime horizon was adopted. Health outcomes and costs were discounted at an annual discount rate of 5%. Deterministic sensitivity analysis, probability sensitivity analysis, and scenario analysis were performed. The impact of the inclusion of PER in the NRDL on the medical insurance budget over 3 years (2021-2023) was also estimated. Results: Cost-effectiveness analysis indicates that 8 mg/day of PER increases QALYs by 0.054 and saves costs by $2,390 compared with 400 mg/day of LCM. 4 mg/day of PER increases QALYs by 0.010 and saves costs by $860 compared with 200 mg/day of LCM. Deterministic sensitivity analysis reveals that utility value and the extreme discount rate are the factors with the greatest impact on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis show that the results are robust. Budget impact analysis indicates that after inclusion of PER in the NRDL, the incremental budget would be $1.28, $2.83, and $4.56 million from 2021 to 2023, respectively, but covering more eligible epileptic patients in the same time (1,918, 4,287, and 8,983, respectively).

Since 2013, a population-wide H. pylori eradication strategy for patients with chronic gastritis has begun to prevent gastric cancer in Japan. The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic and health effects of H. pylori eradication strategy in national gastric cancer prevention program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a cohort state-transition model for H. pylori eradication and no eradication over a lifetime horizon from a healthcare payer perspective, and performed one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We targeted a hypothetical cohort of H. pylori-positive patients aged 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80.

33587,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Direct Oral Anticoagulants Versus Vitamin K Antagonists for Venous Thromboembolism in China.,"Background: The drug therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE) presents a significant economic burden to the health-care system in low- and middle-income countries. To understand which anticoagulation therapy is most cost-effective for clinical decision-making , the cost-effectiveness of apixaban (API) versus rivaroxaban (RIV), dabigatran (DAB), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), followed by vitamin K antagonist (VKA), in the treatment of VTE in China was assessed. Methods: To access the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis was constructed using a Markov model with 5 health states. The Markov model was developed using patient data collected from the Xijing Hospital from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2021. The time horizon was set at 30 years, and a 6-month cycle length was used in the model. Costs and ICERs were reported in 2020 U.S. dollars. One-way sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) were used to test the uncertainties. A Chinese health-care system perspective was used. Results: In the base case, the data of 231 VTE patients were calculated in the base case analysis retrospectively. The RIV group resulted in a mean VTE attributable to 95% effective treatment. API, DAB, and VKA have a negative ICER (-187017.543, -284,674.922, and -9,283.339, respectively) and were absolutely dominated. The Markov model results confirmed this observation. The ICER of the API and RIV was negative (-216176.977), which belongs to the absolute inferiority scheme, and the ICER value of the DAB and VKA versus RIV was positive (110,577.872 and 836,846.343). Since the ICER of DAB and VKA exceeds the threshold, RIV therapy was likely to be the best choice for the treatment of VTE within the acceptable threshold range. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the model output varied mostly with the cost in the DAB on-treatment therapy. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis of 1,000 patients for 30 years, RIV has 100% probability of being cost-effective compared with other regimens when the WTP is $10973 per QALY. When WTP exceeded $148,000, DAB was more cost-effective than RIV. Conclusions: Compared with LMWH + VKA and API, the results proved that RIV may be the most cost-effective treatment for VTE patients in China.

Results: In the base case, the data of 231 VTE patients were calculated in the base case analysis retrospectively. The RIV group resulted in a mean VTE attributable to 95% effective treatment. API, DAB, and VKA have a negative ICER (-187017.543, -284,674.922, and -9,283.339, respectively) and were absolutely dominated. The Markov model results confirmed this observation. The ICER of the API and RIV was negative (-216176.977), which belongs to the absolute inferiority scheme, and the ICER value of the DAB and VKA versus RIV was positive (110,577.872 and 836,846.343). Since the ICER of DAB and VKA exceeds the threshold, RIV therapy was likely to be the best choice for the treatment of VTE within the acceptable threshold range. The results of the sensitivity analysis revealed that the model output varied mostly with the cost in the DAB on-treatment therapy. In a probabilistic sensitivity analysis of 1,000 patients for 30 years, RIV has 100% probability of being cost-effective compared with other regimens when the WTP is $10973 per QALY. When WTP exceeded $148,000, DAB was more cost-effective than RIV.

33589,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Direct Oral Anticoagulants Versus Vitamin K Antagonists for Venous Thromboembolism in China.,"Background: The drug therapy of venous thromboembolism (VTE) presents a significant economic burden to the health-care system in low- and middle-income countries. To understand which anticoagulation therapy is most cost-effective for clinical decision-making , the cost-effectiveness of apixaban (API) versus rivaroxaban (RIV), dabigatran (DAB), and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), followed by vitamin K antagonist (VKA), in the treatment of VTE in China was assessed. Methods: To access the quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), a long-term cost-effectiveness analysis was constructed using a Markov model with 5 health states. The Markov model was developed using patient data collected from the Xijing Hospital from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2021. The time horizon was set at 30 years, and a 6-month cycle length was used in the model. Costs and ICERs were reported in 2020 U.S. dollars.

33590,Minimally invasive surgery for suspected early-stage ovarian cancer; a cost-effectiveness study.,"OBJECTIVE: While there are a number of benefits to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for women with ovarian cysts, there is an increased risk of ovarian capsule rupture during the procedure, which could potentially seed the abdominal cavity with malignant cells. We developed a decision model to compare the risks, benefits, effectiveness and cost of MIS versus laparotomy in women with ovarian masses. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness study POPULATION: Hypothetical cohort of 10 000 women with ovarian masses who were undergoing surgical management. METHODS: The initial decision point in the model was performance of surgery via laparotomy or a MIS approach. Model probabilities, costs and utility values were derived from published literature and administrative data sources. Extensive sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the cost-effectiveness of MIS versus laparotomy for women with a pelvic mass measured by incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: MIS was the least costly strategy at $7,732 per women on average, compared with $17,899 for laparotomy. In our hypothetical cohort of 10 000 women, there were 64 cases of ovarian rupture in the MIS group and 53 in the laparotomy group, while there were 26 cancer-related deaths in the MIS group and 25 in the laparotomy group. MIS was more effective than laparotomy (188 462 QALYs for MIS versus 187 631 quality adjusted life years [QALYs] for laparotomy). Thus, MIS was a dominant strategy, being both less costly and more effective than laparotomy. These results were robust in a variety of sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: MIS constitutes a cost-effective management strategy for women with suspicious ovarian masses.

33591,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Pembrolizumab Plus Pemetrexed and Platinum Versus Chemotherapy Alone as First-Line Treatment in Metastatic Non-Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Reconstruction of Partitioned Survival Model Based on Time Dependent Pricing Mechanism of Patient Assistance Program.,"OBJECTIVES: A new patient assistance program (PAP) for pembrolizumab was started in China in 2021. The researchers aimed to evaluate the economic outcomes of pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum versus chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, based on the pricing mechanism of PAP. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Survival analysis and partitioned survival model were performed to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) in the pembrolizumab group compared with the chemotherapy group. Survival probabilities were extracted from the data of the KEYNOTE-189 trial. Cost and utility data were gathered from published literature. The pricing mechanism of PAP was set in each cycle in the partitioned survival model, according to the progression-free survival (PFS) data of the KEYNOTE-189 trial, which included PFS-1 and PFS-2. Deterministic sensitivity analysis and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were conducted. RESULTS: The ICER of the pembrolizumab group versus chemotherapy group was $65,272/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), which still exceeded the willingness-to-pay threshold of three times per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of China ($33,581.22), although PAP was calculated. Sensitivity analysis implied that the price of chemotherapeutic drugs combined with pembrolizumab was one of the main influencing factors of ICER.

The impact of real-world adherence rates on the cost-effectiveness of non-invasive stool-based CRC screening strategies remains undefined. METHODS: This cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of Medicare as a primary payer used the Colorectal Cancer and Adenoma Incidence and Mortality Microsimulation Model (CRC-AIM) to estimate cost and clinical outcomes for triennial multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA), annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and annual fecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening strategies in a simulated cohort of US adults aged 65 years, who were assumed to either be previously unscreened or initiating screening upon entry to Medicare. Reported real-world adherence rates for initial stool-based screening and colonoscopy follow up (after a positive stool test result) were defined as 71.1% and 73.0% for mt-sDNA, 42.6% and 47.0% for FIT, and 33.4% and 47.0% for FOBT, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using quality-adjusted life years (QALY) was defined as the primary outcome of interest; other cost and clinical outcomes were also reported in secondary analyses. Multiple sensitivity and scenario analyses were conducted. RESULTS: When reported real-world adherence rates were included only for initial stool-based screening, mt-sDNA was cost-effective versus FIT ($62,814/QALY) and FOBT ($39,171/QALY); mt-sDNA also yielded improved clinical outcomes. When reported real-world adherence rates were included for both initial stool-based screening and follow-up colonoscopy (when indicated), mt-sDNA was increasingly cost-effective compared to FIT and FOBT ($31,725/QALY and $28,465/QALY, respectively), with further improved clinical outcomes.

33598,"Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Biopharmaceuticals for Treating Rheumatoid Arthritis: Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept.","INTRODUCTION: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic progressive inflammatory disease that causes joint destruction. The condition imposes a significant economic burden on patients and societies. The present study is aimed at evaluating the cost-effectiveness of Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept in treating rheumatoid arthritis in Iran. METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness study of economic evaluation in which the Markov model was used. The study was carried out on 154 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Fars province taking Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept. The patients were selected through sampling. In this study, the cost data were collected from a community perspective, and the outcomes were the mean reductions in DAS-28 and QALY. The cost data collection form and the EQ-5D questionnaire were also used to collect the required data. The results were presented in the form of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and the sensitivity analysis was used to measure the robustness of the study results. The TreeAge Pro and Excel softwares were used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The results showed that the mean costs and the QALY rates in the Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept arms were $ 79,518.33 and 12.34, $ 91,695.59 and 13.25, and $ 87,440.92 and 11.79, respectively. The one-way sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. In addition, the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) indicated that on the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, Infliximab was in the acceptance area and below the threshold in 77% of simulations. The scatter plot was in the mentioned area in 81% and 91% of simulations compared with Adalimumab and Etanercept, respectively, implying lower costs and higher effectiveness than the other two alternatives. Therefore, the strategy was more cost-effective. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, Infliximab was more cost-effective than the other two medications.

The condition imposes a significant economic burden on patients and societies. The present study is aimed at evaluating the cost-effectiveness of Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept in treating rheumatoid arthritis in Iran. METHODS: This is a cost-effectiveness study of economic evaluation in which the Markov model was used. The study was carried out on 154 patients with rheumatoid arthritis in Fars province taking Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept. The patients were selected through sampling. In this study, the cost data were collected from a community perspective, and the outcomes were the mean reductions in DAS-28 and QALY. The cost data collection form and the EQ-5D questionnaire were also used to collect the required data. The results were presented in the form of an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and the sensitivity analysis was used to measure the robustness of the study results. The TreeAge Pro and Excel softwares were used to analyze the collected data. RESULTS: The results showed that the mean costs and the QALY rates in the Infliximab, Adalimumab, and Etanercept arms were $ 79,518.33 and 12.34, $ 91,695.59 and 13.25, and $ 87,440.92 and 11.79, respectively. The one-way sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the results. In addition, the results of the probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) indicated that on the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve, Infliximab was in the acceptance area and below the threshold in 77% of simulations. The scatter plot was in the mentioned area in 81% and 91% of simulations compared with Adalimumab and Etanercept, respectively, implying lower costs and higher effectiveness than the other two alternatives. Therefore, the strategy was more cost-effective. CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study, Infliximab was more cost-effective than the other two medications.
