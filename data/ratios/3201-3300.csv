3201,Should all pregnant diabetic women undergo a fetal echocardiography? A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing four screening strategies,"OBJECTIVE: To determine if a policy of universal fetal echocardiography for all pregnant diabetic women is cost-effective as a screening tool for congenital heart defects. STUDY DESIGN: Using a decision-analysis model, we compared the cost-effectiveness of four screening strategies: (1) none--no ultrasound is performed; (2) selective fetal echocardiography after abnormal detailed anatomic survey; (3) fetal echocardiography for only high hemoglobin A1C, and (4) universal fetal echocardiography for all diabetics. The sensitivity and specificity for each strategy were derived by literature search. The analysis was from a societal perspective using a willingness-to-pay threshold (50,000 dollars) and a theoretic cohort of 40,000 pregnant diabetics. Costs included costs of tests and the costs of complications and of raising a child with a cardiac defect. Outcomes were reported as cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained for each congenital heart defect prevented by each strategy and the number of congenital heart defects detected. One-way, multiway and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Compared with the other strategies, selective fetal echocardiography after abnormal detailed anatomic survey costs less per QALY gained for cardiac defect screening. Although universal fetal echocardiography was associated with a higher detection rate for cardiac defects, it was more costly. The sensitivity analyses revealed a robust model over a wide range of values. CONCLUSION: Under the baseline assumptions, selective fetal echocardiography after an abnormal detailed anatomic survey is more cost-effective compared with universal fetal echocardiography as a screening strategy for cardiac defects in pregnant diabetics.",2006-01-01717,16378332,Prenat Diagn,Anthony O Odibo,2006,26 / 1,39-44,No,16378332,"Anthony O Odibo; Kara M Coassolo; David M Stamilio; Serdar H Ural; George A Macones; Kara M Coassolo; David M Stamilio; Serdar H Ural; George A Macones; Should all pregnant diabetic women undergo a fetal echocardiography?

3204,A randomized clinical trial of lung volume reduction surgery versus best medical care for patients with advanced emphysema: a two-year study from Canada,"BACKGROUND: We present a summary report evaluating the efficacy of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) in patients with advanced emphysema in the Canadian setting. METHODS: Quality of Life measures assessed the efficacy of adding LVRS to best medical care including rehabilitation in this blinded randomized multicentered controlled trial with 2 years of follow-up. Health utility and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were outcomes central to our economic assessment. RESULTS: None of the 32 patients randomized to the LVRS arm or 30 patients in the best medical care (BMC) arm crossed-over and no patients were lost to follow-up. Overall surgical mortality was 16% at 2 years while the overall medical mortality was 13% (p = 0.914). There were no 30-day postoperative deaths but 2 deaths (6%) occurred within 90 days of randomization. Surgery reduced the residual volume measured at 6 months by 23% (5,385 mL to 4,322 mL, p = 0.007). There was an increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 30% (265 mL, p = 0.013) from baseline, an improvement in the six minute walk test (6MWT) of 78 meters (p = 0.045), and an increase in Health Utility Index 3 (HUI3) which peaked at 6 months with a difference of 0.16 (p = 0.129). There was a gain in QALYs of 0.21 (p = 0.19) in the LVRS-arm over the BMC-arm. The LVRS costs an additional 28,119 Canadian dollars (CAD) compared with BMC or 133,900 CAD/QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of LVRS to best medical care including pulmonary rehabilitation improves pulmonary function, exercise activity, and quality of life in selected patients with advanced emphysema.

3205,Cost-effectiveness of losartan-based therapy in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy: a UK-based economic evaluation of the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study,"The Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study demonstrated the clinical benefit of losartan-based therapy in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), mainly due to a highly significant 25% reduction in the relative risk of stroke compared with an atenolol-based regimen, for a similar reduction in blood pressure. The aim of this economic evaluation was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of losartan compared with atenolol from a UK national health system perspective. Quality-adjusted survival and direct medical costs were modelled beyond the trial using the within-trial incidence of stroke. Survival with stroke, study medication use and quality of life by stroke status were taken directly from the LIFE trial. The LIFE data were supplemented with UK data on lifetime direct medical costs of stroke and life expectancy in individuals without stroke. No additional stroke events or use of study treatment were assumed beyond the trial. Costs and benefits were discounted using current UK Treasury rates. In the base-case analysis, the reduction in stroke-related costs (by 968 sterling pound) offset 86% of the increase in study medication costs (1128 sterling pound) among losartan-treated patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for losartan versus atenolol in hypertensive patients with LVH was 2130 sterling pound per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (3195 Euro/QALY), and this increased to 11,352 sterling pound per QALY gained (16,450 Euro/QALY) when the costs of stroke beyond the first 5 years were excluded. Thus, the clinical benefit of losartan was achieved at a cost well within reported thresholds for cost-effectiveness.",2006-01-01721,16357874,J Hum Hypertens,G McInnes,2006,20 / 1,51-8,No,16357874,"G McInnes; T A Burke; G Carides; T A Burke; G Carides; Cost-effectiveness of losartan-based therapy in patients with hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy: a UK-based economic evaluation of the Losartan Intervention for Endpoint reduction in hypertension (LIFE) study, J Hum Hypertens, 2006-Jan; 20(1):0950-9240; 51-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,50mg Losartan,Not Stated,80 Years,55 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,2130,United Kingdom,2003,4897.46
3206,Effectiveness and cost effectiveness of early and late prevention of HIV/AIDS progression with antiretrovirals or antibiotics in Southern African adults,"As HIV/AIDS drugs are becoming more widely available in Southern Africa, we compared the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of different treatment options, using a Markov Monte Carlo simulation model based on published estimates of disease progression, treatment effectiveness and health care costs.

Results showed that triple antiretroviral therapy (ARV) plus antibiotics would prolong life by 6.7 undiscounted years if provided 'late' (CD4 = 200 cells/microl) and by 9.8 years if provided 'early' (CD4 = 350 cells/microl). The incremental undiscounted costs per year of life gained, compared to no preventive therapy, were $17 for isoniazid plus cotrimoxazole started late, $244 for both antibiotics started early, $2454 for ARV plus antibiotics started late and $2784 for ARV plus both antibiotics started early. The discounted incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were, respectively, $29 saving, $254, $4937 and $3057.

3219,Long-term hormone therapy and radiation is cost-effective for patients with locally advanced prostate carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: In Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial 92-02, after men received neoadjuvant hormone cytoreduction and radiotherapy for locally advanced prostate carcinoma, they were randomized to receive either 2 years of long-term androgen-deprivation (LTAD) or no further treatment (short-term androgen-deprivation [STAD]). The specific objective of the current study was to determine whether LTAD was a cost-effective treatment for patients with locally advanced prostate carcinoma. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of LTAD was tested using a Markov model that was designed using proprietary software. The analysis took a payor's perspective. Unit costs were obtained by estimation using a global Medicare fee schedule. Costs and outcomes were discounted by 3%. Distributions were sampled at random from the treatment utilities, transition probabilities, and costs using a second-order Monte Carlo simulation technique. RESULTS: The expected mean cost was 32,564 dollars for LTAD compared with 33,039 dollars for STAD after accounting for the additional cost of salvage treatment for men who were treated with STAD. The mean number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for men who received LTAD was 4.13 QALYs compared with a mean of 3.68 QALYs for men who received STAD. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analysis showed a 91% probability that LTAD was cost-effective compared with STAD. Although overall survival was similar in the LTAD and STAD groups, the patients who received LTAD experienced gains in QALYs and had lower costs, because LTAD prevented biochemical failure and the necessitating salvage hormone therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The current analysis showed that LTAD was cost-effective for the entire population studied in RTOG trial 92-02.",2006-01-01724,16323171,Cancer,Andre Konski,2006,106 / 1,51-7,No,16323171,"Andre Konski; Deborah Watkins-Bruner; Harmar Brereton; Steven Feigenberg; Gerald Hanks; Deborah Watkins-Bruner; Harmar Brereton; Steven Feigenberg; Gerald Hanks; Long-term hormone therapy and radiation is cost-effective for patients with locally advanced prostate carcinoma, Cancer, 2006-Jan-01; 106(1):0008-543X; 51-7",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Long-term androgen-deprivation with radiation therapy (RT) vs. Short-term androgen-deprivation with RT,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,1122.22,United States,2003,1578.5
3220,Economic evaluation of MR cholangiopancreatography compared to diagnostic ERCP for the investigation of biliary tree obstruction,"BACKGROUND: Use of magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) for confirmation of presence of biliary obstruction is virtually risk-free. However, unlike diagnostic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), no therapeutic option can be offered simultaneously with MRCP. The aim of the study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of MRCP when compared with the conventional practice of diagnostic ERCP for the investigation of biliary obstruction in adults. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis from the perspective of the health care provider. Sensitivity analysis includes presentation of a family of cost effectiveness acceptability curves and the impact of different risks of common bile duct stones associated with ultrasound and liver function test results. The main outcome measure is cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY). RESULTS: Baseline results, at 37% probability of common bile duct stones, show that MRCP is the dominant strategy, with expected savings of pound149 ( pound325 to - pound15) and expected QALY gain of 0.011 (0-0.030) per case. The probability of avoiding unnecessary therapeutic ERCP is 30%. For patients at high risk of common bile duct stones (probability >60%) ERCP is the preferable strategy. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline estimate is that MRCP would be both cost saving and would result in improved quality of life outcomes compared to diagnostic ERCP, but its potential sources of economic benefit are highly dependent on access to, and waiting lists for adequate MRI technology at hospital level.",2006-01-02262,17462309,Int J Surg,Yolanda Bravo Vergel,2006,4 / 1,12-9,No,17462309,"Yolanda Bravo Vergel; Jim Chilcott; Eva Kaltenthaler; Stephen Walters; Anthony Blakeborough; Steven Thomas; Economic evaluation of MR cholangiopancreatography compared to diagnostic ERCP for the investigation of biliary tree obstruction, Int J Surg, 2006; 4(1):1743-9159; 12-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,MR cholangiopancreatography,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-13545.46,United Kingdom,2001,-28497.98

3227,Cost effectiveness of lenalidomide in the treatment of transfusion-dependent myelodysplastic syndromes in the United States,"Lenalidomide has been approved for the treatment of transfusion-dependent low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) associated with a chromosome 5q deletion with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of lenalidomide versus best supportive care (BSC) in these patients. We developed a decision analytic model to compare costs and outcomes of lenalidomide with BSC without recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) versus BSC with EPO over 1 year. Outcome measures were transfusion independence and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. The model incorporated costs of medications, transfusions, chelation, laboratory tests, office visits, and other resources associated with each therapy. Lenalidomide therapy was associated with an estimated incremental 0.53 transfusion-free and 0.25 QALY gain compared to BSC at 1 year. The costs of lenalidomide therapy were substantially offset by reduced blood transfusion and EPO costs. One-year total treatment costs were estimated at $63,385 for lenalidomide and $54,940 for BSC. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for lenalidomide vs BSC was estimated at $16,066 per transfusion-free year and $35,050 per QALY gained, values within the acceptable cost-effectiveness ranges for a new therapy. Results suggest that oral lenalidomide is cost effective in the United States in the treatment of transfusion-dependent, low- or intermediate-1-risk MDS associated with a deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality.

3228,Cost utility of substituting enoxaparin for unfractionated heparin for prophylaxis of venous thrombosis in the hospitalized medical patient,"BACKGROUND: Both heparin and enoxaparin are effective for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in medical patients. On the basis of price, heparin appears preferable because it is less expensive. However, choosing enoxaparin may have greater cost utility when the outcomes of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HITT) are considered. OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost utility of substituting enoxaparin for heparin from payer and institutional perspectives. DESIGN: A decision analysis model was used. Cost data were based on Medicare reimbursement and the medication and laboratory costs for a multi-institutional healthcare system. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) saved by preventing HIT/HITT through the use of enoxaparin were based on published data. Costs are expressed on a per-day basis, and the incremental cost of enoxaparin over that of heparin was used in the calculation of cost/QALY. A sensitivity analysis also was performed. SETTING: Inpatient medicine. PATIENTS: All medical patients for whom VTE prophylaxis was appropriate. INTERVENTIONS: Substitution of enoxaparin for heparin. MEASUREMENT: Cost/QALY. RESULTS: From a payer perspective, using enoxaparin resulted in a decrease in cost of 28.61 dollars over that of heparin and saved 0.00629 QALYs in the base case, resulting in a savings of 4550.17 dollars/QALY. The sensitivity analysis showed this finding of decreased cost and increased effectiveness to be consistent. From an institutional perspective, the use of heparin generally appeared less costly but was dependent on medication price, length of stay required, and bed utilization. CONCLUSIONS: From a payer and, by extrapolation, a societal perspective, cost-utility analysis supports the use of enoxaparin in place of heparin for the prevention of VTE in medical inpatients. From an institutional perspective, the decision is more complicated, but in most cases, the use of enoxaparin also is supported.",2006-01-02288,17219491,J Hosp Med,Luci Leykum,2006,1 / 3,168-76,No,17219491,"Luci Leykum; Jacqueline Pugh; David Diuguid; Kyriakos Papadopoulos; Cost utility of substituting enoxaparin for unfractionated heparin for prophylaxis of venous thrombosis in the hospitalized medical patient, J Hosp Med, 2006-May; 1(3):1553-5606; 168-76",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Enoxaparin (low-molecular-weight-heparin),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,-4546.9,United States,2005,-6025.54
3229,Cost-effectiveness of pregabalin for the management of neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia: a Canadian perspective,"BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain (NeP) is a chronic condition that occurs frequently with diabetes and herpes zoster infection. In addition to potentially lasting many years, the relationship between chronic pain, anxiety/depression, and sleep, also referred to as the triad of pain, causes functional impairment in many areas of life. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the 12-week cost-effectiveness of 2 treatments of NeP, pregabalin versus gabapentin, in managing diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) and postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) in a Canadian setting. METHODS: A stochastic simulation model evaluating NeP treatment was adapted to the Canadian setting. Using data from clinical trials of pregabalin (150-600 mg/d) and gabapentin (900-3600 mg/d), the model simulated 12-week treatment outcomes for patients with DPN or PHN. Resource utilization was identified through an Internet-based survey among 80 Canadian physicians. Utility values (as measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D) were obtained from 126 NeP patients participating in a cross-sectional study conducted at Canadian primary care sites. The economic analysis was expressed as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained and as incremental cost per day with no or mild pain. Model sensitivity to changes in key parameters was assessed. RESULTS: Following 12-week treatment, compared with gabapentin, pregabalin was projected to result in 6 and 9 additional days with no or mild pain for patients with DPN and PHN, respectively. Pregabalin therapy was estimated to provide an additional 0.0047 QALY and 0.0086 QALY over gabapentin administration, for DPN and PHN, respectively. Mean (SE) direct costs per DPN patient were estimated as 837.53 Can dollars (37.31 dollars) (2004 dollars) with gabapentin and 818.49 dollars (36.50 dollars) with pregabalin, and per PHN patient as 720.61 dollars (33.70 dollars) with gabapentin and 667.07 dollars (25.33 dollars) with pregabalin. Model findings were sensitive to variation in the dose and corresponding cost of the comparator, but not in other parameters.

We hypothesized that parathyroidectomy would be more cost-effective than observation or pharmacologic therapy for these patients. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed comparing treatment strategies for asymptomatic PHPT. Treatment outcomes, their probabilities, and costs were identified on the basis of literature and cost database review. Outcomes were weighted by using established quality-of-life utility factors. Sensitivity analysis was used to examine the uncertainty of costs and utility estimates in the model. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for parathyroidectomy was US dollars 4778 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Operation remained cost-effective until the average cost of parathyroidectomy increased from the estimated value of US dollars 4778 to US dollars 14,650. Pharmacologic therapy was not cost-effective unless the annual cost of therapy decreased from an estimated US dollars 7406 (for cinacalcet) to US dollars 221. Parathyroidectomy ceases to be preferred over monitoring if a quality-of-life difference is not demonstrable after curative operation.

The goal of this paper was to determine the long-term cost-effectiveness (over 20 years) of referring hip fracture surgeries to high-volume hospitals, based on data from previous studies. From a societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness ratio was 15,530 Euro per QALY (quality-adjusted life year) (95% confidence interval 9,864-33,048 Euro), while total annual costs to the statutory health insurance amounted up to 19.6 million Euro.

3234,Cost-utility analysis of short- versus long-course palliative radiotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy can effectively palliate the symptoms of poor-prognosis patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. However, controversy remains about whether short-course or more protracted radiotherapy schedules provide better value for the money. We conducted a societal cost-utility analysis of a Dutch multicenter randomized trial with 1-year follow-up that compared the efficacy of radiotherapy schedules consisting of 10 fractions of 3 Gy (10 x 3 Gy) versus two fractions of 8 Gy (2 x 8 Gy) in 297 patients with inoperable stage IIIA/B or stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer. this trial found that the 10 x 3-Gy group had better survival than the 2 x 8-Gy group. METHODS: Lifetime quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated using the EuroQol questionnaire. Lifetime societal costs were estimated using a model estimated based on data from cost questionnaires filled out by a subset of patients (n = 56). Differences were analyzed statistically using two-sided nonparametric bootstrapping. RESULTS: Compared with the 2 x 8-Gy group, the 10 x 3-Gy group accrued statistically significantly more QALYs (20.0 versus 13.2 weeks; difference = 6.8 weeks, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1 to 13.5 weeks, P = .05), which was mainly due to the statistically significantly better survival (38.1 versus 27.4 weeks; difference = 10.7 weeks, 95% CI = 0.9 to 20.6 weeks, P = .03) without a statistically significant difference with respect to the average valuation of health (P = .27). Total radiotherapy and radiotherapy-related costs were estimated at 5236 dollars for the 10 x 3-Gy group and 2512 dollars for the 2 x 8-Gy group (difference = 2724 dollars, 95% CI = 2501 dollars to 2947 dollars, P<.001). The 39% increase in life expectancy in the 10 x 3-Gy group as compared with the 2 x 8-Gy group was associated with a 30% increase in survival-related nonradiotherapy costs (11,254 dollars versus 8651 dollars, difference 2602 dollars, 95% CI = -357 dollars to 5562 dollars, P = .09). The cost-utility ratio for the 10 x 3-Gy schedule versus the 2 x 8-Gy schedule was estimated at 40,900 dollars per QALY (95% CI = 19,400 dollars to 1,100,000 dollars per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: In these poor-prognosis non-small-cell lung cancer patients, the estimated cost-utility ratio for the palliative 10 x 3-Gy schedule was acceptable according to current economic standards.

3238,Cost-effectiveness analyses and modelling the lifetime costs and benefits of health-behaviour interventions,"BACKGROUND: We describe an approach to estimating the cost-effectiveness of an intervention that changes health behaviour. The method captures the lifetime costs and benefits incurred by participants in an ongoing cluster-randomized controlled trial of an intervention that aims to change health behaviour. The existing literature only captures short-term economic and health outcomes. METHODS: We develop a state-transition Markov model of how individuals move between different health behaviour states over time. We simulate hypothetical data to describe the costs and health benefits of the intervention, illustrate how the data collected in the ongoing randomized controlled trial can be used and demonstrate how incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are estimated. RESULTS: On the basis of the simulated (i.e. hypothetical) data, we estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life year. The estimate reflects the lifetime health and economic consequences of the intervention. DISCUSSION: The method used for the cost-effectiveness analysis described in this paper is appropriate for investigating whether interventions that change health behaviour in relation to chronic diseases represent good value for money as compared to alternative uses of scarce healthcare resources.",2006-01-02305,17175653,Chronic Illn,Nicholas Graves,2006,2 / 2,97-107,No,17175653,"Nicholas Graves; Loretta McKinnon; Marina Reeves; Paul Scuffham; Louisa Gordon; Elizabeth Eakin; Cost-effectiveness analyses and modelling the lifetime costs and benefits of health-behaviour interventions, Chronic Illn, 2006-Jun; 2(2):1742-3953; 97-107",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Life style management throught telephone- 18 calls over 12 months,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,540,Australia,2004,544.88
3240,"The cost-effectiveness of Antiretroviral Treatment in Khayelitsha, South Africa - a primary data analysis","ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Given the size of the HIV epidemic in South Africa and other developing countries, scaling up antiretroviral treatment (ART) represents one of the key public health challenges of the next decade. Appropriate priority setting and budgeting can be assisted by economic data on the costs and cost-effectiveness of ART. The objectives of this research were therefore to estimate HIV healthcare utilisation, the unit costs of HIV services and the cost per life year (LY) and quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained of HIV treatment interventions from a provider's perspective. METHODS: Data on service utilisation, outcomes and costs were collected in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Utilisation of a full range of HIV healthcare services was estimated from 1,729 patients in the Khayelitsha cohort (1,146 No-ART patient-years, 2,229 ART patient-years) using a before and after study design. Full economic costs of HIV-related services were calculated and were complemented by appropriate secondary data. ART effects (deaths, therapy discontinuation and switching to second-line) were from the same 1,729 patients followed for a maximum of 4 years on ART. No-ART outcomes were estimated from a local natural history cohort. Health-related quality of life was assessed on a sub-sample of 95 patients. Markov modelling was used to calculate lifetime costs, LYs and QALYs and uncertainty was assessed through probabilistic sensitivity analysis on all utilisation and outcome variables. An alternative scenario was constructed to enhance generalizability. RESULTS: Discounted lifetime costs for No-ART and ART were US$2,743 and US$9,435 over 2 and 8 QALYs respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio through the use of ART versus No-ART was US$1,102 (95% CI 1,043-1,210) per QALY and US$984 (95% CI 913-1,078) per life year gained. In an alternative scenario where adjustments were made across cost, outcome and utilisation parameters, costs and outcomes were lower, but the ICER was similar. CONCLUSION: Decisions to scale-up ART across sub-Saharan Africa have been made in the absence of incremental lifetime cost and cost-effectiveness data which seriously limits attempts to secure funds at the global level for HIV treatment or to set priorities at the country level. This article presents baseline cost-effectiveness data from one of the longest running public healthcare antiretroviral treatment programmes in Africa that could assist in enhancing efficient resource allocation and equitable access to HIV treatment.",2006-01-02316,17147833,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Susan M Cleary,2006,4 /,20,Yes,17147833,"Susan M Cleary; Di McIntyre; Andrew M Boulle; The cost-effectiveness of Antiretroviral Treatment in Khayelitsha, South Africa - a primary data analysis, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2006; 4():1478-7547; 20",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Antiretroviral therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1102,United States,2003,1550.05

3245,"Expanded HIV screening in the United States: effect on clinical outcomes, HIV transmission, and costs","BACKGROUND: An extensive literature supports expanded HIV screening in the United States. However, the question of whom to test and how frequently remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To inform the design of HIV screening programs by identifying combinations of screening frequency and HIV prevalence and incidence at which screening is cost-effective. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis linking simulation models of HIV screening to published reports of HIV transmission risk, with and without antiretroviral therapy. DATA SOURCES: Published randomized trials, observational cohorts, national cost and service utilization surveys, the Red Book, and previous modeling results. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. communities with low to moderate HIV prevalence (0.05% to 1.0%) and annual incidence (0.0084% to 0.12%). TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. INTERVENTIONS: One-time and increasingly frequent voluntary HIV screening of all adults using a same-day rapid test. OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV infections detected, secondary transmissions averted, quality-adjusted survival, lifetime medical costs, and societal cost-effectiveness, reported in discounted 2004 dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Under moderately favorable assumptions regarding the effect of HIV patient care on secondary transmission, routine HIV screening in a population with HIV prevalence of 1.0% and annual incidence of 0.12% had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 30,800 dollars/QALY (one-time screening), 32,300 dollars/QALY (screening every 5 years), and 55,500 dollars/QALY (screening every 3 years). In settings with HIV prevalence of 0.10% and annual incidence of 0.014%, one-time screening produced cost-effectiveness ratios of 60,700 dollars/QALY. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: The cost-effectiveness of screening policies varied within a narrow range as assumptions about the effect of screening on secondary transmission varied from favorable to unfavorable. Assuming moderately favorable effects of antiretroviral therapy on transmission, cost-effectiveness ratios remained below 50,000 dollars/QALY in settings with HIV prevalence as low as 0.20% for routine HIV screening on a one-time basis and at prevalences as low as 0.45% and annual incidences as low as 0.0075% for screening every 5 years.

3246,The costs and benefits of enhanced depression care to employers,"CONTEXT: Although outreach and enhanced treatment interventions improve depression outcomes, uptake has been poor in part because purchasers lack information on their return on investment. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the costs and benefits of enhanced depression care for workers from the societal and employer-purchaser perspectives. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses using state-transition Markov models. Simulated movements between health states were based on probabilities drawn from the clinical literature. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohort of 40-year-old workers. Intervention Enhanced depression care consisting of a depression screen and care management for those depressed vs usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Our base-case cost-effectiveness analysis was from the societal perspective; costs and quality-adjusted life-years were used to compute the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention relative to usual care. A secondary cost-benefit analysis from the employer's perspective tracked monetary costs and monetary benefits accruing to employers during a 5-year time horizon. RESULTS: From the societal perspective, screening and depression care management for workers result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19 976 per quality-adjusted life-year relative to usual care. These results are consistent with recent primary care effectiveness trials and within the range for medical interventions usually covered by employer-sponsored insurance. From the employer's perspective, enhanced depression care yields a net cumulative benefit of $2895 after 5 years. In 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses, these findings were robust to a variety of assumptions. CONCLUSION: If these results can be replicated in effectiveness trials directly assessing effects on work outcomes, they suggest that enhanced treatment quality programs for depression are cost-beneficial to purchasers.",2006-01-02320,17146009,Arch Gen Psychiatry,Philip S Wang,2006,63 / 12,1345-53,No,17146009,"Philip S Wang; Amanda Patrick; Jerry Avorn; Francisca Azocar; Evette Ludman; Joyce McCulloch; Gregory Simon; Ronald Kessler; The costs and benefits of enhanced depression care to employers, Arch Gen Psychiatry, 2006-Dec; 63(12):0003-990X; 1345-53",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,One-time workplace-based depression screening for all employees and care management for those with positive results for depression,Not Stated,17 Years,7 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,19976,United States,2004,27369.02
3247,Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding a cognitive behavioral treatment to the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate return to work and cost-effectiveness of the addition of cognitive-behavioral treatment to standard therapy compared to standard 3-week inpatient rehabilitation for patients with chronic low back pain. METHODS: A prospective economic evaluation alongside a randomized controlled trial was performed. Outcomes included days off work due to spinal complaints, health-related quality of life, and direct and indirect disease-related costs. RESULTS: A total of 409 patients with chronic low back pain, who were admitted to a 3-week inpatient rehabilitation, were randomly assigned to usual care or usual care plus cognitive behavioral treatment. Average incremental costs for psychological treatment during rehabilitation were Euros 127 (95% CI 125.6, 130.9; p < 0.001). Six months after rehabilitation, patients in the intervention group were absent from work an average of 5.4 (95% CI -1.4, 12.1; p = 0.12) days less than patients receiving usual treatment. Between groups, there were no significant differences in quality-adjusted life-years gained or in direct medical or nonmedical costs. The cognitive behavioral treatment showed lower indirect costs: Euros 751 (95% CI -145, 1641; p = 0.097). CONCLUSION: Adding a cognitive behavioral component to standard therapy may reduce work days lost and thus decrease indirect costs.

3250,The Cost-effectiveness of perindopril in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease using data from the EUROPA Study,"Objectives The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of perindopril in stable coronary heart disease in the UK Background The European trial on Reduction Of cardiac events with Perindopril in stable coronary Artery disease (EUROPA) trial has recently reported. Methods Clinical and resource use data were taken from the EUROPA trial. Costs included medications and hospitalisations. Health-related quality of life values were taken from external sources. Cost-effectiveness analysis is presented as a function of the risk of a primary event (non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death) in order to identify individuals for whom treatment offers greatest value for money. Results The median incremental cost per QALY gained of perindopril across the heterogeneous population of EUROPA was estimated as 9,700 GBP (inter-quartile range: 6,400 GBP - 14,200 GBP). Overall, 88% of the EUROPA population had an estimated cost per QALY below 20,000 GBP and 97% below 30,000 GBP. For a threshold value of cost-effectiveness of 30,000 GBP per QALY gained, individuals representing the 25th, 50th (median) and 75th percentiles of the cost-effectiveness distribution for perindopril have probabilities of 0.999, 0.99 and 0.93 of being cost-effective, respectively. Cost-effectiveness was strongly related to higher risk of a primary event under standard care. Conclusions Whether the use of perindopril can be considered cost-effective depends on the health care systems' threshold value of cost-effectiveness. For the large majority of patients included in EUROPA, the incremental cost per QALY gained is lower than the apparent threshold used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the UK.",2006-01-02327,17135223,Heart,Andrew Briggs,2006,/,,No,17135223,"Andrew Briggs; Borislava Mihaylova; Mark Sculpher; Alistair Hall; Jane Wolstenholme; Maarten Simoons; Jaap Deckers; Ferrari Roberto; Willem J Remme; Michel Bertrand; Kim Fox; Borislava Mihaylova; Mark Sculpher; Alistair Hall; Jane Wolstenholme; Maarten Simoons; Jaap Deckers; Roberto Ferrari; Willem J Remme; Michel Bertrand; Kim Fox; The Cost-effectiveness of perindopril in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease using data from the EUROPA Study, Heart, 2006-Nov-29; ():1468-201X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Perindopril: 8mg once daily, for 5-years or until death vs. Placebo",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,50 Years,3.50,3.50,9700,United Kingdom,2004,24360.42
3252,Cost-effectiveness of hematologic growth factors for anemia occurring during hepatitis C combination therapy,"In hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients who develop anemia during combination therapy, erythropoietic growth factors maintain higher drug treatment levels compared to ribavirin dose reduction, which may lead to an increase in treatment response rates. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of growth factor therapy in maintaining anemic HCV-infected patients on target drug levels during combination therapy. A decision analysis using a Markov model was developed with 7 health states: Sustained viral response, chronic HCV, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, and death. Data sources included population-based studies of growth factor therapy, previously published estimates of costs and natural history of hepatitis C, and recent prospective studies. Our reference case was a 45-year-old Caucasian man with HCV infection (genotype 1, 2, or 3) who developed anemia while undergoing combination therapy with ribavirin and pegylated interferon. We compared growth factor injections (darbepoetin alpha or epoetin alpha) during combination therapy with standard ribavirin dose reduction. Compared to a ribavirin dose reduction strategy, the cost of darbepoetin per additional quality-adjusted life-year was 34,793 dollars for genotype 1 and 33,832 dollars for genotypes 2 or 3 versus 60,600 dollars and 64,311 dollars for epoetin. For all genotypes, the results were sensitive to changes in the cure rates of HCV therapy, the utility of chronic HCV, the costs of growth factors, and the age at which therapy is begun.

The objective of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a nursing intervention on antiretroviral adherence using data from a randomized controlled clinical trial as input to a computer-based simulation model of HIV disease. For a cohort of HIV-infected patients similar to those in the clinical trial (mean initial CD4 count of 319 cells/mm), implementing the nursing intervention in addition to standard care yielded a 63% increase in virologic suppression at 48 weeks. This produced increases in expected survival (from 94.5 to 100.9 quality-adjusted life months) and estimated discounted direct lifetime medical costs ($253,800 to $261,300). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the intervention was $14,100 per quality-adjusted life year gained compared with standard care.

3261,Under what conditions is feedback microwave thermotherapy (ProstaLund Feedback Treatment) cost-effective in comparison with alpha-blockade in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia and lower urinary tract symptoms?,"OBJECTIVE: Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) are a common condition in men, and their incidence increases with age. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential cost-utility of microwave thermotherapy, specifically the ProstaLund Feedback Treatment (PLFT), versus alpha-blockade in Swedish patients with LUTS due to BPH. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A health-economic simulation model, based on long-term disease progression and costs, was developed to analyse the cost-utility of PLFT in comparison with alpha-blockade over a 3-year period based on data from published literature, treatment programmes and official price lists. Outcome measures used in the analysis were quality of life, survival and reduction in International Prostate Symptom Score. Sensitivity analyses were performed for a number of essential variables. The perspective of the study is the healthcare sector. All costs are expressed as 2003 prices. RESULTS: Three years after an intervention with PLFT or initiation of drug treatment the cost-utility of PLFT was estimated at approximately euro 6600-9500 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. The cost-utility was further improved over a longer time period, and PLFT appears to be cost-saving after 5 years. One important finding from the model simulation was that PLFT also seems to be favourable in patients with less pronounced symptoms. This result may be further validated when additional results from controlled clinical trials become available.

3264,Cost effectiveness of tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors as first-line agents in rheumatoid arthritis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease with an unknown aetiology that results in >9 million physician visits and >250 000 hospitalisations per year in the US. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) inhibitors are effective agents in treating RA; however, their cost effectiveness as first-line agents has not been investigated. This study aimed to examine the cost effectiveness of using TNFalpha inhibitors (both as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate) as first-line agents versus methotrexate (monotherapy) from a payer perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was developed utilising a discount rate of 3% per annum, a cycle length of 1 year and a lifetime time-horizon for a hypothetical cohort of US females aged 55-60 years who had been diagnosed with RA. The source of data for predicted probabilities, expected mortality rates and treatment costs in year 2005 US dollars (drug, toxicity, monitoring and hospitalisation) was from the literature. These costs are assigned in 5-year cycles (calculated from initial 1-year estimates) along with the effect on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), which were calculated using the Health Assessment Questionnaire score. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted on all relevant parameters. RESULTS: Adalimumab, etanercept, adalimumab plus methotrexate and infliximab plus methotrexate had incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) versus methotrexate monotherapy of $US63 769, $US89 772, $US194 589 and $US409 523 per QALY, respectively. When taking into consideration age at diagnosis, the ICER for etanercept ranged from $US84 129 to $US96 225 per QALY. In considering males for the base-case age at diagnosis, the ICER for etanercept versus methotrexate was $US85 100 per QALY. The average lifetime cost across all treatment arms in a woman diagnosed between 55 and 60 years of age was $US211 702. CONCLUSION: While these ICERs cannot be used to directly compare one biological agent with another since there are no comparative trials, they do provide a valid comparison versus methotrexate as first-line agents. Depending where the cost-effectiveness threshold is drawn (i.e. whether it is considered to be $US50 000 or $US100 000 per QALY), etanercept and adalimumab may be considered relatively cost-effective first-line treatments for RA compared with methotrexate monotherapy.",2006-01-02341,17129076,Pharmacoeconomics,James R Spalding,2006,24 / 12,1221-32,Yes,17129076,"James R Spalding; Joel Hay; Cost effectiveness of tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors as first-line agents in rheumatoid arthritis, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(12):1179-2027; 1221-32",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adalimumab,Not Stated,60 Years,55 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,63769,United States,2005,84506.5

3269,Cost-effectiveness of migraine prevention: the case of topiramate in the UK,"The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of topiramate vs. no preventive treatment in the UK. Model inputs included baseline migraine frequency, treatment discontinuation and response, preventive and acute medical cost per attack [2005 GBP ( pound)] and gain in health utility. Outcomes included monthly migraines averted, acute and preventive treatment costs and cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Topiramate was associated with 1.8 fewer monthly migraines and a QALY gain of 0.0384. The incremental cost of topiramate vs. no preventive treatment was about 10 UK pounds per migraine averted and 5700 UK pounds per QALY. Results are sensitive to baseline monthly migraine frequency, triptan use rate and the gain in utility. Incorporating savings from reduced work loss (about 36 UK pounds per month) suggests that topiramate would be cost saving compared with no preventive treatment.

The analysis measured Australian health-care costs and benefits were assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: The analysis resulted in a cost per QALY of 2968 dollars for screening. One-way sensitivity analyses on all variables, and multi-way sensitivity analyses on some variables, showed a wide range for the cost effectiveness, from dominance (where screening is effective and saves money overall) to an ICER of 67,715 dollars per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that annual opportunistic screening for chlamydia in women under 25 is a potentially worthwhile undertaking. However, the analysis also highlights uncertainties around the natural history of chlamydia and the effectiveness of chlamydia screening. Given these uncertainties, the need for further primary data collection in these areas becomes apparent.",2006-01-02350,17112432,Sex Health,Silke Walleser,2006,3 / 4,225-34,No,17112432,"Silke Walleser; Glenn Salkeld; Basil Donovan; The cost effectiveness of screening for genital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in Australia, Sex Health, 2006-Dec; 3(4):1448-5028; 225-34",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Screening program for chlamydia based on annual opportunistic testing,Not Stated,25 Years,Not Stated,Female,Full,25 Years,5.00,5.00,2968,Australia,2004,2994.82
3271,Cost-effectiveness of ventricular assist device use in the United Kingdom: results from the evaluation of ventricular assist device programme in the UK (EVAD-UK),"BACKGROUND: The UK Department of Health funds ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation as a bridge to transplantation (BTT) at three centers. The cost-effectiveness of this program has not been established. METHODS: All 70 VAD implants for BTT and a consecutive cohort of 71 inotrope-dependent transplant candidates, between April 2002 and December 2004, were prospectively monitored for survival, transplantation, quality of life and resource use. Costs and quality-adjusted life-years were estimated for these groups, and for a hypothetical scenario in which VAD patients would die within 30 days in the absence of the program. RESULTS: Mean quality-adjusted life-years for a VAD patient was 3.27 at a lifetime cost of 173,841 pounds (316,078 US dollars). The majority of the cost was attributable to the VAD implant (63,830 pounds, 116,056 US dollars) and the initial hospital stay in the ITU and ward (14,500 pounds, 26,364 US dollars). Inotrope-dependent transplant candidates had mean quality-adjusted life-years of 4.99 at a lifetime cost of 130,905 pounds (238,011 US dollars). The worst clinical scenario resulted in a lifetime cost of 14,400 pounds (26,182 US dollars), based on 1 month in the ICU (mean 15 days). These figures were robust to a range of plausible assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: A lifetime model based on current UK practice demonstrates that BTT VAD patients had significant quality-adjusted life-years, but treatment was expensive when compared with the worst clinical scenario. If device technology improves, costs are reduced, or referral practice changes, results should be re-assessed.",2006-01-02357,17097498,J Heart Lung Transplant,Linda D Sharples,2006,25 / 11,1336-43,No,17097498,"Linda D Sharples; Matthew Dyer; Fay Cafferty; Nikolaos Demiris; Carol Freeman; Nicholas R Banner; Stephen R Large; Steven Tsui; Noreen Caine; Martin Buxton; Cost-effectiveness of ventricular assist device use in the United Kingdom: results from the evaluation of ventricular assist device programme in the UK (EVAD-UK), J Heart Lung Transplant, 2006-Nov; 25(11):1053-2498; 1336-43",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation as a bridge to heart transplantation (worst-case scenario),Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,49384,United Kingdom,2005,119131.61

3288,Using contrast sensitivity to estimate the cost-effectiveness of verteporfin in patients with predominantly classic age-related macular degeneration,"AimsTo re-evaluate the cost-effectiveness of photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (Visudyne((R)), Novartis AG, Switzerland) in patients with predominantly classic and classic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) owing to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), using new evidence on the impact of contrast sensitivity on health status.MethodA health economic model is used to synthesise the evidence on contrast sensitivity and treatment rates from the TAP Investigation with health state utilities and costs. Impairment of visual function is estimated using a Markov model to predict transitions between states of contrast sensitivity. Each state is associated with costs and a health state utility. Total expected costs and benefits for a cohort of patients over a defined number of cycles are calculated. The expected health state utility for each disease state was estimated using results from a study of 209 patients with AMD in Sheffield. The model includes the costs associated with treatment and monitoring in the verteporfin treatment arm and costs offset by delaying the deterioration of visual function.ResultsBeyond 3 years, the annual costs of the verteporfin arm are estimated to be less than the annual costs of the control arm, owing to the cost associated with higher blindness prevalence in the control arm. Over time, the results show that both the incremental utility and cost decreases. By 10 years, the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness is approximately pound20 996 per Quality-Adjusted Life Years.ConclusionThe results of this study suggest that the verteporfin therapy in the treatment for patients with predominantly classic and classic CNV owing to AMD is encouraging.Eye advance online publication, 3 November 2006; doi:10.1038/sj.eye.6702636.",2006-01-02368,17086167,Eye,N Bansback,2006,/,,No,17086167,"N Bansback; S Davis; J Brazier; S Davis; J Brazier; Using contrast sensitivity to estimate the cost-effectiveness of verteporfin in patients with predominantly classic age-related macular degeneration, Eye, 2006-Nov-03; ():0950-222X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Photodynamic therapy with verteprofin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.50,3.50,20996,United Kingdom,2004,52729.01

DESIGN AND METHODS: A dynamic HIV epidemic model was developed for a population of IDUs and non-IDUs. The location for the study was St. Petersburg, Russia. The adult population aged 15 to 49 years was subdivided on the basis of injection drug use and HIV status. HIV treatment targeted to IDUs and non-IDUs, and untargeted treatment interventions were considered. Health care costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) experienced in the population were measured, and HIV prevalence, HIV infections averted, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of different HAART strategies were calculated. RESULTS: With no incremental HAART programs, HIV prevalence reached 64% among IDUs and 1.7% among non-IDUs after 20 years. If treatment were targeted to IDUs, over 40 000 infections would be prevented (75% among non-IDUs), adding 650 000 QALYs at a cost of USD 1501 per QALY gained. If treatment were targeted to non-IDUs, fewer than 10 000 infections would be prevented, adding 400 000 QALYs at a cost of USD 2572 per QALY gained. Untargeted strategies prevented the most infections, adding 950 000 QALYs at a cost of USD 1827 per QALY gained. Our results were sensitive to HIV transmission parameters.

Short-term cost-effectiveness was evaluated as the incremental cost per incremental mm Hg reduced during the trial. Long-term cost-effectiveness was evaluated as incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained over 10 years. ICG care short-term cost-effectiveness was 20 US dollar per incremental mm Hg reduced for systolic blood pressure (vs standard care, 36 US dollar per mm Hg reduced) and 23 US dollar per incremental mm Hg reduced for diastolic blood pressure (vs standard care, 79 US dollar per mm Hg reduced). In the long term, ICG resulted in a 476 US dollar cost savings and 0.109 quality-adjusted life-years gained per patient (-4,371 US dollar per quality-adjusted life-year gained, sensitivity analysis -8,764 to 13,163 US dollar).

3294,Cost-utility analysis of different peg-interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin treatment strategies as initial therapy for naïve Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis C,"BACKGROUND: Different peg-interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin treatment strategies are more effective in treating hepatitis C. However, no cost-effectiveness data have been published using the clinical data from the peg-interferon alpha-2b and ribavirin in the treatment of patients with hepatitis C in Taiwan. AIM: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of different treatments with peg-interferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin for the initial treatment of patients with different genotype chronic hepatitis C. METHODS: Individual patient level data from a randomized clinical trial with peg-interferon plus ribavirin were applied to a Markov model to project lifelong clinical outcomes. Economic estimates and quality of life were based on published data and Taiwan patient data. We used a societal perspective and applied a 3% annual discount rate. RESULTS: Compared with different combination therapy strategies, peg-interferon alpha-2b plus weight-based dosing of ribavirin in all patients for 24 weeks is the most cost-effective treatment strategy. If the sustained virological response of peg-interferon plus ribavirin treatment for 48 weeks therapy in genotype 1 patients was higher than 67.8%, the best strategy of treating patients will be the peg-interferon plus weight-based dosing of ribavirin therapy for 48 weeks in genotype 1 patients and for 24 weeks in non-genotype 1 patients.

3295,Cost-outcome analysis of booster seats for auto occupants aged 4 to 7 years,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this work was to analyze the societal return on investment in booster seats and in laws requiring their use in the United States. Booster seats reduce crash-related injury. Their use is mandatory for vehicle occupants aged 4 to 7 years in most of the United States. This study estimates the injury cost savings attributable to booster seat use. METHODS: Seat cost came from pricing on the Web and at retailers. Costs of passing and enforcing a legal mandate were estimated as a percentage of the costs of seat use. Injury risk when belted absent a seat was computed from national probability samples of crashes in the last years before booster seats entered into general use (1993-1999). Published estimates were used of the percentage of reduction in injuries achieved with booster seats, the mix of diagnoses reduced, and injury cost by diagnosis. The computations used a 3% discount rate. We studied the net cost per quality-adjusted life year saved, benefit-cost ratio, and net savings per seat. RESULTS: A booster seat costs 30 dollars plus 167 dollars for maintenance and time spent on installation and use. This investment saves 1854 dollars per seat, a return on investment of 9.4 to 1.

3296,Cost-effectiveness of unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasty in elderly low-demand patients. A Markov decision analysis,"BACKGROUND: Interest in unicompartmental knee arthroplasty has recently increased in the United States, making a firm understanding of the indications for this procedure important. The purpose of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty compared with total knee arthroplasty in elderly low-demand patients. METHODS: A Markov decision model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty as compared with total knee arthroplasty in the elderly population. Transition probabilities were estimated from the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register and the arthroplasty literature, and costs were based on the average Medicare reimbursement for unicompartmental, tricompartmental, and revision knee arthroplasties. Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life-years. RESULTS: Our model showed unicompartmental knee arthroplasty to be a cost-effective strategy for this population as long as the annual probability of revision is <4%. The cost of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty must be greater than $13,500 or the cost of total knee arthroplasty must be less than $8500 before total knee arthroplasty becomes more cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that, on the basis of currently available cost and outcomes data, unicompartmental knee arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty have similar cost-effectiveness profiles in the elderly low-demand patient population. However, several important parameters that could alter the cost-effectiveness analysis were identified; these included implant survival rates, costs, perioperative mortality and infection rates, and utility values achieved with each procedure. The thresholds identified in this study may help decision-makers to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each strategy as further research characterizes the variables associate with unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasties and may be helpful for designing future appropriate clinical trials.",2006-01-02378,17079390,J Bone Joint Surg Am,James Slover,2006,88 / 11,2348-55,No,17079390,"James Slover; Birgitte Espehaug; Leif Ivar Havelin; Lars Birger Engesaeter; Ove Furnes; Ivan Tomek; Anna Tosteson; Cost-effectiveness of unicompartmental and total knee arthroplasty in elderly low-demand patients.

3297,A French cost-consequence analysis of the renoprotective benefits of irbesartan in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension,"OBJECTIVES: We performed a cost-consequence analysis in a French setting of the renoprotective benefit of irbesartan in hypertensive type 2 diabetes patients over a 25-year period. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A previously published Markov model simulated progression from microalbuminuria to overt nephropathy, doubling of serum creatinine, end-stage renal disease and death. Three treatment strategies with analogous blood pressure control were compared: (A) control--conventionally medicated antihypertensive therapy (excluding angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, other angiotensin-2-receptor antagonists and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers) initiated at microalbuminuria; (B) early irbesartan--(300 mg daily added to control, initiated with microalbuminuria) and (C) late irbesartan--(300 mg daily, initiated with overt nephropathy). Probabilities came from the Irbesartan in Reduction of Microalbuminuria-2 study, Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial and other sources. Clinical and economic outcomes were projected over 25 years. Annual discount rates were 3%. RESULTS: Compared to control, early use of irbesartan added (mean +/- standard deviation) 1.51 +/- 0.08 undiscounted life years (discounted: 0.94 +/- 0.05 years), while late irbesartan added 0.07 +/- 0.01 (0.04 +/- 0.01) years/patient. Early irbesartan added 1.03 +/- 0.06 discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), while late irbesartan added 0.06 +/- 0.01 QALYs. Early and late irbesartan treatments were projected to save 22,314 +/- 1273 euro and 6619 +/- 820 euro/patient, respectively versus control. Sensitivity analysis showed that even over short time horizons both irbesartan treatments were superior to the control group.

3300,The cost utility of strabismus surgery in adults,"PURPOSE: Cost-utility analysis evaluates the cost of medical care in relation to the gain in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Our purpose was to develop a cost model for surgical care for adult strabismus, to estimate the mean cost per case, to determine the associated gain in QALYs, and to perform cost-utility analysis. METHODS: A cost model incorporated surgery, pre- and postoperative care, and a mean of 1.5 procedures per patient. The gain in QALYs was based on the improvement of utility on a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). Utility was measured through physician-conducted interviews employing a time tradeoff question (seeking to estimate the portion of life expectancy a patient would be willing to trade for being rid of disease and associated effects). The interviews were conducted before and 5 to 8 weeks after surgery in 35 strabismic patients (age 19-75 years). RESULTS: The cost model resulted in an estimated total cost of 4,254 dollars per case. A significant improvement of utility was found: 0.96 +/- 0.11 postoperatively versus 0.85 +/- 0.20 preoperatively (p = 0.00008). Based on the mean life expectancy (36.0 years) of these patients, and discounting outcomes and costs by 3% annually, this resulted in a mean value gain of 2.61 QALYs after surgery and a cost-utility for strabismus surgery of 1,632 dollas/QALY. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, treatments <50,000 dollars/QALY are generally considered ""very cost-effective.""
