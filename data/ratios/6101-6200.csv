6101,"Cost-effectiveness of latanoprost and timolol maleate for the treatment of glaucoma in Scandinavia and the United Kingdom, using a decision-analytic health economic model","PURPOSE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of latanoprost or timolol in glaucoma treatment in Norway, Sweden, Denmark (Scandinavia) and the United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. Health states were 'stable' and 'progressed' glaucoma, and transition probabilities for both primary open-angle and exfoliation glaucoma were derived from the medical literature. Practice patterns were obtained from surveys completed by 54 ophthalmologists geographically dispersed throughout each country. Country specific unit costs were used for medications, patient visits, diagnostics, and therapeutic procedures. RESULTS: Over the life of the model latanoprost was less expensive than timolol by 5.3-7.6% (Scandinavia) and 2.1% (UK). Following adjustments, therapy in the original timolol-treated cohort was slightly more effective in each country with a difference in 0.003-0.015 years to progression of glaucoma existing between latanoprost. This may have resulted from the model design, which reflected that physicians ultimately control most patients' glaucoma over 5 years by adding or changing therapy. The associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for latanoprost vs timolol generated by the Scandinavian and the UK models, respectively, were: Norway 351,396 NOK; Sweden 988,985 SEK; Denmark 351,641; and the UK 4751 GBP.

6104,Cost-Effectiveness of 21 Alternative Cervical Cancer Screening Strategies,"ABSTRACT Objectives: The aim of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of 21 alternative cervical cancer screening (CCS) strategies. Methods: A cohort simulation model was developed to determine from a health systems perspective the cost-effectiveness of the 21 alternative CCS strategies that incorporated combinations of Papanicolaou's smear test (PAP), liquid-based cytology (LBC) or human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid (HPV-DNA) testing. The model was calibrated to categorize total costs into four budgetary authorities: testing, physician, inpatient, and outpatient services. Within each category, alternative screening strategies were contrasted in terms of their cost impacts and the percent change calculated within each category. Epidemiologic data and costs were derived from administrative health databases. Estimates of test characteristics and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were derived from available literature. Results: Three-year screening with PAP and HPV-DNA triage testing for women older than 30 years of age (3-year PAP + HPV + PAP-age) is less costly and more effective saving $16,078 per additional QALY gained. Although there was an associated net cost decrease of 4.2% driven by a reduction in testing and physician costs of 22.1% and 18.6%, respectively, there is a cost increase of 0.8% and 27.7% in inpatient and outpatient services, respectively.

6108,Crossing Borders: Factors Affecting Differences in Cost-Effectiveness of Smoking Cessation Interventions between European Countries,"ABSTRACT Objectives: Many different factors affect the transferability of cost-effectiveness results between countries. The objective is to quantify the impact of nine potential causes of variation in cost-effectiveness of pharmacological smoking cessation therapies (SCTs) between The Netherlands (reference case), Germany, Sweden, UK, Belgium, and France. Methods: The life-time benefits of smoking cessation were calculated using the Benefits of Smoking Cessation on Outcomes model, following a cohort of smokers making an unaided quit attempt, or using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), bupropion, or varenicline. We investigated the impact of between-country differences in nine factors-demography, smoking prevalence, mortality, epidemiology and costs of smoking-related diseases, resource use and unit costs of SCTs, utility weights and discount rates-on the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB), using a willingness-to-pay (WTP) of euro 20,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY). Results: The INMB of 1000 quit attempts with NRT versus unaided, varies from euro 0.39 million (Germany) to euro 1.47 million (France). The differences between the countries were primarily due to differences in discount rates, causing the INMB to change between -65% to +62%, incidence and mortality rates (epidemiology) of smoking-related diseases (-43% to +35%) and utility weights. Impact also depended on the WTP for a QALY and time horizon: at a low WTP or a short time horizon, the resource use and unit costs of SCTs had the highest impact on INMB.

6111,Cost-Effectiveness of Sorafenib for Second-Line Treatment of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,"ABSTRACT Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer, Leverkusen, Germany) versus best supportive care (BSC) for second-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Methods: A decision analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sorafenib. The clinical effectiveness of sorafenib versus BSC was taken from a recent randomized phase III trial. Utility values were taken from a phase II trial of sunitinib, using EQ-5D tariffs. Cost data were obtained from published literature and were based on current UK practice. The effect of parameter uncertainty on cost-effectiveness was explored through extensive one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared to BSC, sorafenib treatment resulted in an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained of pound75,398, based on an estimated mean gain of 0.27 QALYs per patient, at a mean additional cost of pound20,063 (inflated to 2007/2008). The probability that sorafenib is cost-effective compared to BSC at a willingness to pay threshold of pound30,000 per QALY is 0.0%. In sensitivity analysis, estimates of cost per QALY were sensitive to changes in the clinical effectiveness parameters, and to health state utilities and drug costs.

The probability that temsirolimus is cost-effective compared to interferon-alpha at a willingness to pay threshold of pound30,000 per QALY for all patient groups is expected to be close to zero. The cost per QALY was sensitive to the clinical effectiveness parameters, health state utilities, drug costs and the cost of administration of temsirolimus.

6115,Cost-Effectiveness of Temsirolimus for First Line Treatment of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,"ABSTRACT Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of temsirolimus compared to interferon-alpha for first line treatment of patients with advanced, poor prognosis renal cell carcinoma, from the perspective of the UK National Health Service. Methods: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of temsirolimus. The clinical effectiveness of temsirolimus compared with interferon-alpha and the utility values (using EQ-5D tariffs) were taken from a recent phase III randomized clinical trial. Cost data were obtained from published literature and based on current UK practice. The effect of parameter uncertainty on cost-effectiveness was explored through extensive one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results: Compared to interferon-alpha, temsirolimus treatment resulted in an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound94,632; based on an estimated mean gain of 0.24 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient, at a mean additional cost of pound22,331 (inflated to 2007/8).

6116,Economic Evaluation of Sinfrontal(R) in the Treatment of Acute Maxillary Sinusitis in Adults,"Sinfrontal(R), a complex homeopathic medication, is popular in Germany for the treatment of ear, nose and throat and respiratory tract infections. Unlike many other homeopathic or herbal medications, the efficacy and safety of Sinfrontal(R) has been demonstrated in a number of clinical studies of patients with sinusitis. To assess the cost effectiveness of Sinfrontal(R) versus placebo in the treatment of adults with acute maxillary sinusitis (AMS) in Germany. A secondary objective was to assess the cost effectiveness of Sinfrontal(R) versus standard treatment with antibacterials. Sinfrontal(R) was compared with placebo in a cost-utility analysis based on data from a randomized controlled clinical trial over 3 weeks (Sinfrontal(R) group: n = 57; placebo group: n = 56). Trial data were analysed from a societal perspective; resource use was valued with German unit costs for 2005. In a secondary analysis, the longer-term cost utility of Sinfrontal(R) versus placebo was estimated over a total of 11 weeks based on an 8-week post-treatment observational phase. In addition, the cost effectiveness of Sinfrontal(R) versus antibacterials was determined based on an indirect comparison of placebo-controlled trials. Sinfrontal(R) led to incremental savings of &U20AC;275 (95% CI 433, 103) per patient compared with placebo over 22 days, essentially due to the markedly reduced absenteeism from work (7.83 vs 12.9 workdays). Incremental utility amounted to 0.0087 QALYs (95% CI 0.0052, 0.0123), or 3.2 quality-adjusted life-days (QALDs). Bootstrapping showed that these findings were significant, with Sinfrontal(R) being dominant in 99.9% of simulations. The results were robust to a number of sensitivity analyses. In the secondary analysis, Sinfrontal(R) led to incremental cost savings of &U20AC;511 and utility gains of 0.015 QALYs or 5.4 QALDs compared with placebo. Compared with antibacterials, Sinfrontal(R) had a significantly higher cure rate (11% vs 59%; p < 0.001) at similar or lower costs. The results of this economic evaluation indicate that Sinfrontal(R) may be a cost-effective treatment for AMS in adults.",2009-01-05388,19799472,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Kyra Kneis,2009,7 / 3,181-191,Yes,19799472,"Kyra Kneis; Afschin Gandjour; Economic Evaluation of Sinfrontal(R) in the Treatment of Acute Maxillary Sinusitis in Adults, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2009-Sep-01; 7(3):1179-1896; 181-191",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Sinfrontal, homeopathic medication for treatment of sinusitis vs. Placebo",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-31614.94,Euro,2005,-52155.15
6117,Short-Term Cost and Health Consequences of Duodenal Levodopa Infusion in Advanced Parkinson's Disease in Sweden: An Exploratory Study,"Levodopa is the cornerstone treatment for Parkinson's disease, but the short half-life of levodopa limits its usefulness in late stages of the disease. Duodenal levodopa infusion (DLI) allows more stable plasma levels and better motor symptom control. To explore the costs and health benefits of replacing conventional oral polypharmacy with DLI in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, from a Swedish healthcare payer perspective. Based on a clinical, randomized, crossover study with 24 patients (DIREQT), a decision analytic model predicted 2-year drug costs and QALYs for conventional oral therapy and for DLI. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) was recorded using a 15-dimensional (15D) utility instrument at baseline and during the two 3-week trial periods, and then at eight follow-up visits during the subsequent 6 months. Use of medication was based on data from DIREQT and previous studies. Unit costs were based on market prices (drugs) and customary charges in Sweden. All costs were expressed in Swedish kronor (SEK), year 2004 values (&U20AC;1.00 approximately SEK9.17, $US1.00 = SEK7.47). Future costs and outcomes were discounted at 3%. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted. The mean utility scores were 0.77 for DLI and 0.72 for conventional therapy (p = 0.02). A considerable variation in the scores was observed during the study. The expected per-patient 2-year cost of DLI was SEK562 000 while it was SEK172 000 for conventional therapy. The mean number of QALYs was 1.48 and 1.42, respectively, representing an incremental cost of SEK6.1 million per QALY for DLI (all values discounted at 3%). Using other assumptions in sensitivity analyses, the cost per QALY could be as low as SEK456 000. This analysis can be considered exploratory only; it is based on very limited data. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that DLI results in a significant improvement in HR-QOL. However, the cost per QALY is likely to be higher than customary cost-effectiveness thresholds. Whether these benefits justify the additional costs depends on how the health benefits are measured and how these benefits are valued by society.",2009-01-05389,19799471,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Ivar Kristiansen,2009,7 / 3,167-180,Yes,19799471,"Ivar Kristiansen; Kerstin Bingefors; Dag Nyholm; Dag Isacson; Short-Term Cost and Health Consequences of Duodenal Levodopa Infusion in Advanced Parkinson's Disease in Sweden: An Exploratory Study, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2009-Sep-01; 7(3):1179-1896; 167-180",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Duodenal levodopa infusion vs. Conventional oral polypharmacy, including oral levodopa",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,650000,Sweden,2004,121403.38
6118,Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic surgery for duodenal cancer in familial adenomatous polyposis,"BACKGROUND: Duodenal cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in familial adenomatous polyposis after colorectal cancer. The lifetime risk for developing duodenal cancer is 4% to 10%. Current treatment guidelines recommend endoscopic surveillance with a prophylactic pancreaticoduodenectomy in advanced duodenal polyposis, defined using the Spigelman staging system. Because no clinical trials have assessed this recommendation, a modeling approach was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of various treatment strategies. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the life expectancy and cost of three different strategies: pancreaticoduodenectomy at Spigelman stage III, pancreaticoduodenectomy at Spigelman stage IV, and pancreaticoduodenectomy at cancer diagnosis. A cohort of 30-year-old familial adenomatous polyposis patients with total colectomies was simulated until age 80. The analysis was from a societal perspective. Extensive sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the impact of model uncertainty on results. RESULTS: At all stages of polyposis and all ages <80 years, prophylactic surgery at Spigelman stage IV resulted in the greatest life expectancy. Surgery at stage IV was more effective and more expensive than surgery at cancer diagnosis, with an incremental cost of $3,200 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Surgery at stage III was not a viable option. The results were robust to wide variation in model parameters but were sensitive to the post-pancreaticoduodenectomy quality of life score.

6122,Economic Appraisal of the Boston Ocular Surface Prosthesis,"PURPOSE: To perform an economic appraisal of the Boston Ocular Surface Prosthesis in patients with corneal ectasia, irregular astigmatism, or ocular surface disease. DESIGN: Cost, incremental cost-effectiveness, and benefit-cost analyses in a prospective observational study. METHODS: The effects of this scleral lens on visual functioning were measured in 69 patients who received the prosthesis in 2006 and were reassessed 6 months after fitting the prosthesis. Benefits, based on improvements in visual functioning, were converted to quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and economic values were derived using results from published studies. Costs were estimated from the provider organization's 2006 operating financial statement with additions for donated resources and future scale-up. RESULTS: Mean scores on a 100-point visual functioning questionnaire (VFQ-25) improved from 57.0 to 77.8 (P < .0001). On average, each fitted patient cost $11,841 ($6,001 for clinical services and $5,840 to produce the prosthesis). Patients' quality of life improved by 0.10 QALYs per year. Assuming that benefits persist for an average of 5 years, the lifetime gain was 0.48 QALYs; the average cost-effectiveness of the prosthesis was $24,900 per QALY (95% confidence interval $19,100 to $29,600), and the average benefit-cost ratio was 4.0 to 1. In patients with the lowest baseline scores (average VFQ score 38.6), results were even more favorable: cost-effectiveness $17,100 per QALY and benefit-cost ratio 5.6 to 1.

6123,Renal transplantation vs hemodialysis: cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND/AIM: Chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), diabetes, hypertension, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) are the main reasons for starting dialysis treatment in patients having kidney function failure. At present, dialysis treatments are performed in about 4,100 patients at 46 institutions in Serbia, out of which 90% are hemodialyses. At end-stage renal disease (ESRD) the only correct selection is kidney transplantation. The basic aim of the planned research was to compare ratio of costs and effects (Cost Effectiveness Analysis - CEA) of hemodialysis and kidney transplantation in patients at ESRD. METHODS: As the main issue of treatment in patients from both groups the life quality measured by the validated McGill Questionary, was used. The study included 150 patients totally, divided into two groups. The study group consisted of 50 patients with kidney transplantation performed at the Clinical Center of Serbia and the control group consisted of 100 patients on hemodialysis at Clinical Center of Serbia, Clinical Hospital Center Zemun, Clinical Hospital Center ""Zvezdara"", Clinical Center Kragujevac and Health Center ""Studenica"", Kraljevo, comparable with respect to sex, age and length of treatment with the study group. RESULTS: Effect of kidney transplantation in relation to hemodialysis being selection of treatment is expressed in the form of incremental ratio of costs and effects (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio - ICER).

The cost-effectiveness of a Telephone Counselling intervention to improve physical activity and diet, targeting adults with established chronic diseases in a low socio-economic area of a major Australian city was examined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A cost-effectiveness modelling study using data collected between February 2005 and November 2007 from a cluster-randomised trial that compared Telephone Counselling with a ""Usual Care"" (brief intervention) alternative. Economic outcomes were assessed using a state-transition Markov model, which predicted the progress of participants through five health states relating to physical activity and dietary improvement, for ten years after recruitment. The costs and health benefits of Telephone Counselling, Usual Care and an existing practice (Real Control) group were compared. Telephone Counselling compared to Usual Care was not cost-effective ($78,489 per quality adjusted life year gained). However, the Usual Care group did not represent existing practice and is not a useful comparator for decision making. Comparing Telephone Counselling outcomes to existing practice (Real Control), the intervention was found to be cost-effective ($29,375 per quality adjusted life year gained). Usual Care (brief intervention) compared to existing practice (Real Control) was also cost-effective ($12,153 per quality adjusted life year gained). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This modelling study shows that a decision to adopt a Telephone Counselling program over existing practice (Real Control) is likely to be cost-effective. Choosing the 'Usual Care' brief intervention over existing practice (Real Control) shows a lower cost per quality adjusted life year, but the lack of supporting evidence for efficacy or sustainability is an important consideration for decision makers. The economics of behavioural approaches to improving health must be made explicit if decision makers are to be convinced that allocating resources toward such programs is worthwhile.

6127,Cost-effectiveness of a telephone-delivered intervention for physical activity and diet,"BACKGROUND: Given escalating rates of chronic disease, broad-reach and cost-effective interventions to increase physical activity and improve dietary intake are needed. The cost-effectiveness of a Telephone Counselling intervention to improve physical activity and diet, targeting adults with established chronic diseases in a low socio-economic area of a major Australian city was examined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A cost-effectiveness modelling study using data collected between February 2005 and November 2007 from a cluster-randomised trial that compared Telephone Counselling with a ""Usual Care"" (brief intervention) alternative. Economic outcomes were assessed using a state-transition Markov model, which predicted the progress of participants through five health states relating to physical activity and dietary improvement, for ten years after recruitment. The costs and health benefits of Telephone Counselling, Usual Care and an existing practice (Real Control) group were compared. Telephone Counselling compared to Usual Care was not cost-effective ($78,489 per quality adjusted life year gained). However, the Usual Care group did not represent existing practice and is not a useful comparator for decision making. Comparing Telephone Counselling outcomes to existing practice (Real Control), the intervention was found to be cost-effective ($29,375 per quality adjusted life year gained). Usual Care (brief intervention) compared to existing practice (Real Control) was also cost-effective ($12,153 per quality adjusted life year gained). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This modelling study shows that a decision to adopt a Telephone Counselling program over existing practice (Real Control) is likely to be cost-effective. Choosing the 'Usual Care' brief intervention over existing practice (Real Control) shows a lower cost per quality adjusted life year, but the lack of supporting evidence for efficacy or sustainability is an important consideration for decision makers. The economics of behavioural approaches to improving health must be made explicit if decision makers are to be convinced that allocating resources toward such programs is worthwhile.

6128,Cost-effectiveness of the artificial liver support system MARS in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure,"BACKGROUND: For patients with an acute exacerbation of chronic liver failure (ACLF), the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) can result in a prolongation of life, but data on costs and cost-effectiveness are lacking. METHODS: A health economic evaluation of a prospective controlled cohort trial in patients with ACLF not eligible for liver transplantation with 3 years follow-up and consecutive modelling of long-term costs, outcomes and cost-effectiveness was conducted. Costs were calculated from the perspective of the German health-care system. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-nine patients with ACLF were included of which 67 (44.9%) were treated with MARS and 82 (55.1%) assigned to the control group. Mean survival was 692 days in MARS-treated patients (33% survival after 3 years) and 453 days in control patients (15% after 3 years, logrank P = 0.022). MARS patients gained 0.66 [95% confidence interval (CI): -0.12 to 1.46] life years (LYs), determined by the bootstrap method. The mean cost difference was 19.835 euro (95% CI: 13.308-25.429) with 35639 euro for MARS-treated patients and 15804 euro for controls. Incremental costs per LY gained were 29.985 euro (95% CI: 9.441-321.761) and 43.040 euro (95% CI: 13.551-461.856) per quality-adjusted LY gained.

6129,Economic evaluation of arthritis self management in primary care,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of a self management programme plus education booklet for arthritis in primary care. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness and cost utility analysis from health and social care and societal perspectives alongside a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: 74 general practices in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 812 patients aged 50 or more with osteoarthritis of the hips or knees, or both, and pain or disability, or both. INTERVENTIONS: Randomisation to either six sessions of an arthritis self management programme plus an education booklet (intervention group) or the education booklet alone (standard care control group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total health and social care costs and total societal costs at 12 months; cost effectiveness (incremental cost effectiveness ratios and cost effectiveness acceptability curves) on basis of quality of life (SF-36, primary outcome measure), EuroQol visual analogue scale, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: At 12 months health and social care costs in the intervention group were pound101 higher (95% confidence interval pound3 to pound176) than those in the control group because the additional costs of the arthritis self management programme did not seem to be fully offset by savings elsewhere. There were no significant differences in societal costs (which were up to 13 times the size of health and social care costs) or any of the outcomes. From the health and social care perspective the intervention was dominated by the control on the basis of QALYs (which were non-significantly lower in the intervention group) and had incremental cost effectiveness ratios between pound279 and pound13 473 for the other outcomes. From the societal perspective the intervention seemed superior to the control owing to non-significantly lower costs and non-significantly better outcomes on all measures except QALYs. Probabilities of the arthritis self management programme's cost effectiveness ranged between 12% and 97% (for thresholds ranging pound0 to pound1000) based on one point improvements in SF-36 outcomes, but the clinical significance of this is debatable. Probabilities of cost effectiveness on the basis of the visual analogue scale and QALYs were low. CONCLUSIONS: Cost effectiveness of an arthritis self management programme is not suggested on the basis of current National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence cost perspectives and QALY thresholds. The probability of cost effectiveness is greater when broader costs and other quality of life outcomes are considered. These results suggest that the cost effectiveness of the Department of Health's expert patients programme cannot be assumed across all clinical conditions and that further rigorous evaluations for other conditions may be needed.

6132,Cost-effectiveness of quetiapine with lithium or divalproex for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder,"Abstract Background: Bipolar I disorder is a recurrent illness that affects 1% of the US population and constitutes a large economic burden. Few studies have investigated the cost-effectiveness of maintenance treatment options. The objective of this analysis was to assess the cost-effectiveness of quetiapine (QTP) in combination with lithium (Li) or divalproex (DVP) compared with that of Li or DVP alone for maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Methods: The cost-effectiveness of maintenance treatment with QTP in combination with Li or DVP was compared with placebo (PBO) in combination with Li or DVP from a US direct costs perspective using a Markov model. The model simulated a cohort of 1,000 stabilized patients with bipolar I disorder and estimated the quarterly risk in three health states: euthymia, mania, and depression. Efficacy data were derived from two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials comparing QTP + Li/DVP with PBO + Li/DVP for up to 2 years. Resource data were obtained from published literature. Direct costs included drug costs, hospitalizations, and physician visits. Outcomes and costs were discounted at 3% and the price reference year was 2007. Endpoints included the number of acute mood episodes, hospitalizations due to an acute mood event, and costs per quality-adjusted life-years. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was conducted to evaluate uncertainty. Results: In the base-case analysis, QTP + Li/DVP dominated PBO + Li/DVP. The PSA showed these results to be robust. In addition, treatment with QTP + Li/DVP was associated with reductions in acute manic episodes (46%), acute depressive episodes (41%), and related hospitalizations (44%) compared with PBO + Li/DVP. Conclusions: These analyses, based on two randomized clinical trials, suggest that QTP + Li/DVP is a cost-effective maintenance treatment option for patients with bipolar I disorder compared with Li or DVP alone.",2009-01-05411,19769548,J Med Econ,Tatia Chay Woodward,2009,/,,Yes,19769548,"Tatia Chay Woodward; Eskinder Tafesse; Peter Quon; Jennifer Kim; Arthur Lazarus; Cost-effectiveness of quetiapine with lithium or divalproex for maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder, J Med Econ, 2009-Sep-22; ():1369-6998",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Quetiapine + lithium + divalproex vs. Placebo + lithium + divalproex,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-137.25,United States,2007,-171.33
6133,The cost-effectiveness of a law banning the use of cellular phones by drivers,"Objective: To assess the cost-effectiveness of a law banning the use of cellular phones by drivers in the Canadian province of Alberta.Method: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a probabilistic decision-analytic model and publicly available data. We adopted a societal perspective. Health gains were measured in terms of quality-adjusted life-years. Costs include those associated with awareness raising, enforcement and the welfare loss associated with the reduction in cellular phone use, less savings in health care and other costs associated with automobile accidents.Results: A ban promotes health and releases resources worth more than the costs. There is an 80% chance that a ban will be 'cost saving', and a 94% chance that a ban will cost less than Can$50 000/QALY. The results are sensitive to the additional risk posed by cellular phone use while driving, and the rate and pattern with which drivers comply with a ban.Conclusion: Under our base line assumptions a cellular phone ban is likely to be cost saving from a societal perspective. The results are sensitive to parameters for which there is very little information or for which the available information is contradictory.

6134,"Cost-effectiveness of aliskiren in type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria","The Aliskiren in the Evaluation of Proteinuria in Diabetes (AVOID) trial demonstrated that adding aliskiren, an oral direct renin inhibitor, at a dosage of 300 mg/d to the highest approved dosage of losartan and optimal antihypertensive therapy reduces albuminuria over 6 mo among patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria. The cost-effectiveness of this therapy, however, is unknown. Here, we used a Markov model to project progression to ESRD, life years, quality-adjusted life years, and lifetime costs for aliskiren plus losartan versus losartan. We used data from the AVOID study and the Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy Trial (IDNT) to estimate probabilities of progression of renal disease. We estimated probabilities of mortality for ESRD and other comorbidities using data from the US Renal Data System, US Vital Statistics, and published studies. We based pharmacy costs on wholesale acquisition costs and based costs of ESRD and transplantation on data from the US Renal Data System. We found that adding aliskiren to losartan increased time free of ESRD, life expectancy, and quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.1772, 0.1021, and 0.0967 yr, respectively. Total expected lifetime health care costs increased by $2952, reflecting the higher pharmacy costs of aliskiren and losartan ($7769), which were partially offset by savings in costs of ESRD ($4860). We estimated the cost-effectiveness of aliskiren to be $30,500 per quality-adjusted life year gained. In conclusion, adding aliskiren to losartan and optimal therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria may be cost-effective from a US health care system perspective.",2009-01-05416,19762496,J Am Soc Nephrol,Thomas E Delea,2009,20 / 10,2205-13,No,19762496,"Thomas E Delea; Oleg Sofrygin; James L Palmer; Helen Lau; Veronica C Munk; Jennifer Sung; Alan Charney; Hans-Henrik Parving; Sean D Sullivan; Cost-effectiveness of aliskiren in type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and albuminuria, J Am Soc Nephrol, 2009-Oct; 20(10):1046-6673; 2205-13",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Aliskiren at a dosage of 300 mg/d, highest approved dosage of losartan (100 mg/d) and optimal antihypertensive therapy vs. Highest approved dosage of losartan (100 mg/d) and optimal antihypertensive therapy",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,30500,United States,2008,36663.38
6135,Six-Month Prophylaxis Is Cost Effective in Transplant Patients at High Risk for Cytomegalovirus Infection,"The risk of late-onset cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection remains a concern in seronegative kidney and/or pancreas transplant recipients of seropositive organs despite the use of antiviral prophylaxis. The optimal duration of prophylaxis is unknown. We studied the cost effectiveness of 6- versus 3-mo prophylaxis with valganciclovir. A total of 222 seronegative recipients of seropositive kidney and/or pancreas transplants received valganciclovir prophylaxis for either 3 or 6 mo during two consecutive time periods. We assessed the incidence of CMV infection and disease 12 mo after completion of prophylaxis and performed cost-effectiveness analyses. The overall incidence of CMV infection and disease was 26.7% and 24.4% in the 3-mo group and 20.9% and 12.1% in the 6-mo group, respectively. Six-month prophylaxis was associated with a statistically significant reduction in risk for CMV disease (HR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17 to 0.72), but not infection (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.37 to 1.14). Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that 6-mo prophylaxis combined with a one-time viremia determination at the end of the prophylaxis period incurred an incremental cost of $34,362 and $16,215 per case of infection and disease avoided, respectively, and $8,304 per one quality adjusted life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses supported the cost effectiveness of 6-mo prophylaxis over a wide range of valganciclovir and hospital costs, as well as variation in the incidence of CMV disease. In summary, 6-mo prophylaxis with valganciclovir combined with a one-time determination of viremia is cost effective in reducing CMV infection and disease in seronegative recipients of seropositive kidney and/or pancreas transplants.",2009-01-05417,19762495,J Am Soc Nephrol,Fu L Luan,2009,/,,No,19762495,"Fu L Luan; Linda J Stuckey; Jeong M Park; Daniel Kaul; Diane Cibrik; Akinlolu Ojo; Six-Month Prophylaxis Is Cost Effective in Transplant Patients at High Risk for Cytomegalovirus Infection, J Am Soc Nephrol, 2009-Sep-17; ():1046-6673",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,6-months prophylaxis with valgaciclovir vs. 3-months prophylaxis with valgaciclovir,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,5.00,5.00,8304,United States,2007,10365.32
6136,Efficacy and economic assessment of conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR): a multicentre randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory failure in adults causes high mortality despite improvements in ventilation techniques and other treatments (eg, steroids, prone positioning, bronchoscopy, and inhaled nitric oxide). We aimed to delineate the safety, clinical efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) compared with conventional ventilation support. METHODS: In this UK-based multicentre trial, we used an independent central randomisation service to randomly assign 180 adults in a 1:1 ratio to receive continued conventional management or referral to consideration for treatment by ECMO. Eligible patients were aged 18-65 years and had severe (Murray score >3.0 or pH <7.20) but potentially reversible respiratory failure. Exclusion criteria were: high pressure (>30 cm H(2)O of peak inspiratory pressure) or high FiO(2) (>0.8) ventilation for more than 7 days; intracranial bleeding; any other contraindication to limited heparinisation; or any contraindication to continuation of active treatment. The primary outcome was death or severe disability at 6 months after randomisation or before discharge from hospital. Primary analysis was by intention to treat. Only researchers who did the 6-month follow-up were masked to treatment assignment. Data about resource use and economic outcomes (quality-adjusted life-years) were collected. Studies of the key cost generating events were undertaken, and we did analyses of cost-utility at 6 months after randomisation and modelled lifetime cost-utility. This study is registered, number ISRCTN47279827. FINDINGS: 766 patients were screened; 180 were enrolled and randomly allocated to consideration for treatment by ECMO (n=90 patients) or to receive conventional management (n=90). 68 (75%) patients actually received ECMO; 63% (57/90) of patients allocated to consideration for treatment by ECMO survived to 6 months without disability compared with 47% (41/87) of those allocated to conventional management (relative risk 0.69; 95% CI 0.05-0.97, p=0.03). Referral to consideration for treatment by ECMO treatment led to a gain of 0.03 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at 6-month follow-up. A lifetime model predicted the cost per QALY of ECMO to be pound19 252 (95% CI 7622-59 200) at a discount rate of 3.5%. INTERPRETATION: We recommend transferring of adult patients with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure, whose Murray score exceeds 3.0 or who have a pH of less than 7.20 on optimum conventional management, to a centre with an ECMO-based management protocol to significantly improve survival without severe disability. This strategy is also likely to be cost effective in settings with similar services to those in the UK.

6137,Cost-effectiveness and Budget Impact of Obesity Surgery in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes in Three European Countries(II),"BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish a payer-perspective cost-effectiveness and budget impact model of adjustable gastric banding (AGB) and gastric bypass (GBP) vs. conventional treatment (CT) in patients with a body mass index (BMI) >/= 35 kg.m(-2) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Austria, Italy, and Spain. METHODS: A health economics model described in a previous publication was applied to resource utilization and cost data in AGB, GBP, and CT from Austria, Italy, and Spain in 2009. RESULTS: The base case time scope is 5 years; the annual discount rate for utilities and costs is 3.5%. In Austria and Italy, both AGB and GBP are cost-saving and are thus dominant in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to CT.

6141,Use of Global Visual Acuity Data in a time trade-off approach to calculate the cost utility of cataract surgery,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost utility of cataract surgery worldwide using visual acuity (VA) outcomes and utility values determined by the time trade-off (TTO) method. DATA SOURCES: Some cost data were taken from a previous search conducted for 1995 to 2006 and we searched MEDLINE and Scopus and Google for more recent data (2006 and 2007). STUDY SELECTION: Articles were identified from the literature using ""cataract surgery"" in combination with the terms outcome or visual acuity. Additional searches were conducted using individual countries as a term in combination with VA, outcome, or cost. Regression curves were constructed from utility values derived from a TTO study and VA data. Gains in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated based on life expectancy tables from the World Health Organization and discounts of 3% for both cost and benefit. Sensitivity analyses explored the effect of changes in discounting, life expectancy, preoperative VA, and cost. DATA EXTRACTION: If the data were usable, they were kept; otherwise they were discarded. DATA SYNTHESIS: Preoperative VA (logMAR) correlated with increasing gross national income per capita (Pearson correlation coefficient, -0.784; P < .001) and showed that in developing countries preoperative vision is much poorer compared with developed countries. Cost utility data ranged from $3.5 to $834/QALY in developing countries to $159 to $1356/QALY in developed countries.

6145,Cost Effectiveness and Screening Interval of Lipid Screening in Hodgkin's Lymphoma Survivors,"PURPOSE: Survivors of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) who received mediastinal irradiation have an increased risk of coronary heart disease. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of lipid screening in survivors of HL and compared different screening intervals. METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate lipid screening in a hypothetical cohort of 30-year-old survivors of HL who survived 5 years after mediastinal irradiation. We compared the following strategies: no screening, and screening at 1-, 3-, 5-, or 7-year intervals. Screen-positive patients were treated with statins. Markov models were used to calculate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime costs. Baseline probabilities, transition probabilities, and utilities were derived from published studies and US population data. Costs were estimated from Medicare fee schedules and the medical literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, lipid screening at every interval was cost effective relative to a strategy of no screening. When comparing screening intervals, a 3-year interval was cost effective relative to a 5-year interval, but annual screening, relative to screening every 3 years, had an ICER of more than $100,000/QALY saved. Factors with the most influence on the results included risk of cardiac events/death after HL, efficacy of statins in reducing cardiac events/death, and costs of statins.

We compared the following strategies: no screening, and screening at 1-, 3-, 5-, or 7-year intervals. Screen-positive patients were treated with statins. Markov models were used to calculate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime costs. Baseline probabilities, transition probabilities, and utilities were derived from published studies and US population data. Costs were estimated from Medicare fee schedules and the medical literature. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Using an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, lipid screening at every interval was cost effective relative to a strategy of no screening. When comparing screening intervals, a 3-year interval was cost effective relative to a 5-year interval, but annual screening, relative to screening every 3 years, had an ICER of more than $100,000/QALY saved. Factors with the most influence on the results included risk of cardiac events/death after HL, efficacy of statins in reducing cardiac events/death, and costs of statins. CONCLUSION: Lipid screening in survivors of HL, with statin therapy for screen-positive patients, improves survival and is cost effective.

6153,Cost-effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in type 2 diabetes patients,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the United States compared with standard medical management, using clinical data from a prospective observational study conducted at an academic medical center. STUDY DESIGN: Our study used a predictive health economic model (the CORE Diabetes Model) to project the long-term costs and clinical effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass as a treatment for T2DM using the prospective observational study as the basis for our clinical effectiveness assumptions. METHODS: The CORE Diabetes Model used Monte Carlo simulation with tracker variables to estimate the lifetime costs and clinical outcomes of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass compared with standard medical management of obese T2DM patients. Sensitivity analyses were performed on key clinical assumptions, discount rates, and shorter time horizons. RESULTS: The base-case scenario yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $21,973 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In sensitivity analyses, shortening the time horizon to 5 and 10 years and excluding the negative impact of increased body mass index on the patient's quality of life had the greatest adverse impact on the ICERs (ie, higher cost per QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Under base-case assumptions, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is cost-effective in the treatment of T2DM in the United States with an ICER below $50,000 per QALY gained. Sensitivity analyses indicated that bariatric surgery is not cost-effective over shorter time horizons, or if the negative quality-of-life impact of increased body mass index is ignored.",2009-01-05438,19747025,Am J Manag Care,Sayeed Ikramuddin,2009,15 / 9,607-15,No,19747025,"Sayeed Ikramuddin; David Klingman; Therese Swan; Michael E Minshall; Cost-effectiveness of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in type 2 diabetes patients, Am J Manag Care, 2009-Sep; 15(9):1096-1860; 607-15",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Bariatric surgery: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass vs. Medical management,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,21973,United States,2007,27427.41
6154,Cost-effectiveness of two therapeutic regimens of infliximab in ankylosing spondylitis: economic evaluation within a randomized controled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of 2 therapeutic regimens of infliximab for ankylosing spondylitis (AS). METHODS: 230 patients with active AS who were participating in a randomized controlled trial comparing 2 infliximab infusion modalities - every 6 weeks (Q6) and on demand (DEM) - were included in an economic evaluation within the trial. Data were collected by phone every 3 months for 1 year. Direct and indirect costs were calculated from a payer perspective. Health-related quality of life was assessed with a general health rating scale. ICERs were calculated for one 20% improvement (ASAS20), for one partial remission and for one quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The Q6 regimen was significantly more efficacious than the DEM regimen but also more costly (22,388 euro vs 17,596 euro; p<0.0001), because it required significantly more infliximab infusions per patient (8.4 vs 6.2). The ICERs of the Q6 to DEM regimen were 15,841 euro for one ASAS20 response, 23,296 euro for one partial remission and 50,760 euro for one QALY gained. CONCLUSION: The administration of infliximab every 6 weeks is cost-effective as compared with a DEM regimen; however, the ICER is close to the acceptability threshold of 50,000 euro for one QALY gained.",2009-01-05444,19740900,Ann Rheum Dis,Bruno Fautrel,2009,/,,No,19740900,"Bruno Fautrel; Mathilde Benhamou; Maxime Breban; Carine Roy; Christelle Lenoir; Gérard Trape; Alain Baleydier; Philippe Ravaud; Maxime Dougados; Cost-effectiveness of two therapeutic regimens of infliximab in ankylosing spondylitis: economic evaluation within a randomized controled trial, Ann Rheum Dis, 2009-Sep-09; ():0003-4967",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Infliximab (5mg/kg) intravenous infusions every 6 weeks vs. Infliximab (5mg/kg) intravenous infusions on demand,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,50760,Euro,2006,81866.21

DESIGN We developed a computer-simulation, probabilistic, decision model to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis, with each patient serving as his or her own control. SETTING University of Connecticut dermatology clinic, a tertiary care referral center. PARTICIPANTS Input data were derived from results of a consecutive sample of 98 patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer on the face and ears, estimates in the literature on 5-year recurrence rates, and a query of healthy focus-group participants. INTERVENTION We considered Mohs and traditional excision strategies. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years, cost, and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS The Mohs strategy was $292 less expensive than the traditional surgical strategy and was more effective by an incremental quality-adjusted life year of 0.056 (translating to approximately 3 weeks of optimal quality of life). Results were robust to subgroup and sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS Mohs may be more cost-effective than traditional excision in eradicating nonmelanoma skin cancer.

6156,The social costs of childhood lead exposure in the post-lead regulation era,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the benefits that might be realized if all children in the United States had a blood lead level of less than 1 microg/dL. DESIGN: Data were obtained from published and electronic sources. A Markov model was used to project lifetime earnings, reduced crime costs, improvements in health, and reduced welfare costs using 2 scenarios: (1) maintaining the status quo and (2) reducing the blood lead level of all children to less than 1 microg/dL. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort of US children between birth and age 6 years in 2008, with economic and health outcomes projected for 65 years. INTERVENTIONS: Increased primary prevention efforts aimed at reducing lead exposure among children and pregnant women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Societal costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: Reducing blood lead levels to less than 1 microg/dL among all US children between birth and age 6 years would reduce crime and increase on-time high school graduation rates later in life. The net societal benefits arising from these improvements in high school graduation rates and reductions in crime would amount to $50 000 (SD, $14 000) per child annually at a discount rate of 3%. This would result in overall savings of approximately $1.2 trillion (SD, $341 billion) and produce an additional 4.8 million QALYs (SD, 2 million QALYs) for US society as a whole.

6157,Probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis of the long-term effect of universal hepatitis B vaccination: An experience from Taiwan with high hepatitis B virus infection and Hepatitis B e Antigen positive prevalence,"AIM: To assess cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination strategies from health care payer and societal perspectives, focusing on the long-term effect, in Taiwan where prevalence of HBV and Hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg) is high. METHODS: A decision analysis was performed to compare total costs and effectiveness between two vaccination strategies: universal vaccination and no-vaccination. The Markov process was defined as a series of states including acute HBV infection, asymptomatic carrier, chronic hepatitis, compensated and decompensated liver cirrhosis, hepatoma, and death. Direct and indirect costs were also imputed based on estimates. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per life-year gained and quality-adjusted life years gained were calculated at a 3% discount rate. By assigning a series of specific distributions to each parameter, a probabilistic cost-effective analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was conducted to yield 5000 ICER replicates. RESULTS: The effectiveness of a universal vaccination program for reducing hepatocellular carcinoma cases and deaths was approximately 86%. The average life years gained per subject as a result of such a universal vaccination was 3.9. The vaccination program dominated over a no-vaccination program (less cost and more effectiveness).

6159,Evaluation of exenatide vs. insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes: cost-effectiveness analysis in the German setting,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness of exenatide vs. insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes failing to achieve glycaemic control with oral antidiabetic agents, in the German setting, from a third-party payer perspective. METHODS: Data from a published randomized controlled trial were used in combination with a published, validated computer simulation model of type 2 diabetes to project clinical and cost outcomes over a time horizon of 10 years. Cost data were obtained from published literature and expert opinion. Clinical and cost outcomes were discounted at 5% per annum. Sensitivity analyses were performed to establish key drivers and parameters. RESULTS: Treatment with exenatide compared with insulin glargine was projected to be associated with improvements in life expectancy of 0.016 years and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.280 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), increased lifetime direct medical costs of euro 3854 (euro 22 095 vs. euro 18 242) and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of euro 13 746 per QALY. If quality of life was not taken into account, exenatide was associated with an ICER of euro 238 201 per life year gained vs. insulin glargine. Sensitivity analyses revealed that outcomes were most sensitive to changes in assumptions for (dis)utility values relating to weight change and the rate of self-monitored blood glucose testing. CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide was projected to be associated with similar clinical outcomes and increased costs compared with insulin glargine.

6160,Cost-Effectiveness of Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillators in Brazil: Primary Prevention Analysis in the Public Sector,"ABSTRACT Background: Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) in chronic heart failure (CHF) patients. Despite its widespread use in developing countries, limited data exist on its cost-effectiveness in these settings. Objective: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ICD in CHF patients under the perspective of the Brazilian Public Healthcare System (PHS). Methods: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ICD compared with conventional therapy in patients with CHF and New York Heart Association class II and III. Effectiveness was evaluated in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and time horizon was 20 years. We searched MEDLINE for clinical trials and cohort studies to estimate data from effectiveness, complications, mortality, and utilities. Costs from the PHS were retrieved from national administrative databases. The model's robustness was assessed through Monte Carlo simulation and one-way sensitivity analysis. Costs were expressed as international dollars, applying the purchasing power parity conversion rate (PPP US$). Results: ICD therapy was more costly and more effective, with incremental cost-effectiveness estimates of PPP US$ 50,345/QALY. Results were more sensitive to costs related to the device, generator replacement frequency and ICD effectiveness. In a simulation resembling the MADIT-I population survival and ICD benefit, the ICER was PPP US$ 17,494/QALY and PPP US$ 15,394/life years. Conclusions: In a Brazilian scenario, where ICD cost is proportionally more elevated than in developed countries, ICD therapy was associated with a high cost-effectiveness ratio.

6161,Cost-effectiveness of raltegravir in antiretroviral treatment-experienced HIV-1-infected patients in Switzerland,"OBJECTIVES: Raltegravir, a novel integrase inhibitor, has shown great efficacy in reducing HIV viral load among treatment-experienced patients. A cohort state-transition model was used to assess the long-term effect of raltegravir treatment on costs and quality-adjusted life expectancy from a Swiss perspective. METHODS: Patients were stratified into health states according to opportunistic infection status, HIV RNA level, and CD4 count, with each group assigned a treatment cost and utility (quality of life) score. Model inputs came from published studies, clinical trials, and database analyses. Results were used to calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of raltegravir use, expressed in Swiss francs (CHF) as incremental cost/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: Five years of raltegravir treatment increased discounted quality-adjusted life expectancy by 3.73 years over placebo, with additional discounted cost of CHF 170,347, resulting in an ICER of CHF 45,687/QALY. ICERs ranged from CHF 42,751 to 53,478/QALY for treatment duration of 3 and 10 years, respectively. Results were most sensitive to changes in raltegravir treatment duration, source of estimated quality of life weights, and raltegravir price.

DESIGN: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost per LTBI case detected, TB case averted and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for a cohort of 1000 individuals at high risk for HIV infection over 20 years. Baseline model inputs for LTBI prevalence were obtained from published literature and cross-sectional data from tuberculosis (TB) screening using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) testing among sex workers and illicit drug users at high risk for HIV recruited through street outreach in Tijuana, Mexico. Costs are reported in 2007 US dollars. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model robustness. RESULTS: Over 20 years, we estimate the program would prevent 78 cases of active TB and 55 TB-related deaths. The incremental cost per case of LTBI detected was US$730, cost per active TB averted was US$529 and cost per QALY gained was US$108.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A validated Markov microsimulation model with a Belgian payer's perspective estimated the cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of a 3-year strontium ranelate treatment compared with no treatment and with the bisphosphonate risedronate. Data on the effect of both treatments on fracture risk were taken from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Analyses were performed for postmenopausal women aged 75 and 80 years, either with a diagnosis of osteoporosis (i.e. bone mineral density T-score </=-2.5 SD) or with prevalent vertebral fractures (PVF). Parameter uncertainty was evaluated using both one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Strontium ranelate was dominant (i.e. more effective and less costly) versus risedronate for women with osteoporosis aged over 75 years and for women with PVF aged 80 years. The cost per QALY gained of strontium ranelate compared with risedronate at 75 years of age was euro11,435 for women with PVF. When compared with no treatment, the costs per QALY gained of strontium ranelate were euro15,588 and euro7,708 at 75 and 80 years of age for women with osteoporosis; the equivalent values were euro16,518 and euro6,015 for women with PVF.

6173,An estimation of the long-term clinical and economic benefits of insulin lispro in Type 1 diabetes in the UK,"AIMS: To determine the long-term health economic benefits associated with lispro vs. regular human insulin (RHI) in UK Type 1 diabetic (T1DM) patients using the previously published and validated CORE Diabetes Model. METHODS: A literature review designed to capture clinical benefits associated with lispro and T1DM cohort characteristics specific to UK was undertaken. Clinical benefits were derived from a Cochrane meta-analysis. The estimated difference (weighted mean) in glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) was -0.1% (95% confidence interval -0.2 to 0.0%) for lispro vs. RHI. Severe hypoglycaemia rates for lispro and RHI were 21.8 and 46.1 events per 100 patient years, respectively. Costs and disutilities were accounted for severe hypoglycaemia rates. All costs were accounted in 2007 poundUK from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective. Future costs and clinical benefits were discounted at 3.5% annually. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, lispro was projected to be dominant compared with RHI. Lispro was associated with improvements in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of approximately 0.10 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) vs. RHI (7.60 vs. 7.50 QALYs). Lifetime direct medical costs per patient were lower with lispro treatment, pound70 576 vs. pound72 529. Severe hypoglycaemia rates were the key driver in terms of differences in QALE and lifetime costs. Sensitivity analyses with assumptions around time horizon, discounting rates and benefits in terms of glycaemic control or hypoglycaemic event rates revealed that lispro remained dominant.

6174,Cost-Effectiveness of Using Clinical Risk Factors with and without DXA for Osteoporosis Screening in Postmenopausal Women,"ABSTRACT Background: According to several guidelines, the assessment of postmenopausal fracture risk should be based on clinical risk factors (CRFs) and bone density. Because measurement of bone density by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is quite expensive, there has been increasing interest to estimate fracture risk by CRFs. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening of CRFs with and without DXA compared with no screening in postmenopausal women in Germany. Methods: A cost-utility analysis and a budget-impact analysis were performed from the perspective of the statutory health insurance. A Markov model simulated costs and benefits discounted at 3% over lifetime. Results: Cost-effectiveness of CRFs compared with no screening is euro4607, euro21,181, and euro10,171 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for 60-, 70-, and 80-year-old women, respectively. Cost-effectiveness of DXA plus CRFs compared with CRFs alone is euro20,235 for 60-year-old women. In women above the age of 70, DXA plus CRFs dominates CRFs alone. DXA plus CRFs results in annual costs of euro175 million, or 0.4% of the statutory health insurance's annual budget.

6177,Cost-Effectiveness of Using Clinical Risk Factors with and without DXA for Osteoporosis Screening in Postmenopausal Women,"ABSTRACT Background: According to several guidelines, the assessment of postmenopausal fracture risk should be based on clinical risk factors (CRFs) and bone density. Because measurement of bone density by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is quite expensive, there has been increasing interest to estimate fracture risk by CRFs. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis screening of CRFs with and without DXA compared with no screening in postmenopausal women in Germany. Methods: A cost-utility analysis and a budget-impact analysis were performed from the perspective of the statutory health insurance.

This multicenter prospective randomized clinical trial with cost-utility analysis was conducted at 38 general practices and three sport medical advice centers in the Netherlands for 2007. A total of 131 patients were included. The annual direct medical costs per patient were significantly higher for the intervention group (euro434) compared with the control group (euro299) mainly caused by additional physiotherapy visits. The average annual societal costs per patient were significantly lower in the intervention group (euro1011 vs euro1.166). Productivity costs were the largest cost component, in particular costs due to reduced efficiency at paid work which were responsible for 47% and 56% of the total costs in the intervention and control group respectively. Patients in the intervention group experienced a slightly, but not significantly, higher quality of life (0.8722 vs 0.8617).

6186,Cost-effectiveness of ACE inhibitor therapy to prevent dialysis in nondiabetic nephropathy: influence of the ACE insertion/deletion polymorphism,"INTRODUCTION: End-stage renal disease is associated with high health-care costs and low quality of life compared with chronic kidney disease. The renoprotective effectiveness of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) is largely determined by the ACE insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism. We determined the cost-effectiveness of ACEi therapy in nondiabetic nephropathy for the ACE II/ID and for the ACE DD genotype separately. Furthermore, we considered a selective screen-and-treat strategy in which patients are prescribed alternative, more effective, therapy based on their ACE (I/D) polymorphism. METHODS: Time-dependent Markov models were constructed; cohorts of 1000 patients were followed for 10 years. Data were mainly gathered from the Ramipril Efficacy In Nephropathy trial. Both univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: ACEi therapy dominated placebo in both the ACE II/ID group (euro15 826, and 0.091 quality-adjusted life years gained per patient) and the ACE DD group (euro105 104 and 0.553 quality-adjusted life years gained). Sensitivity analyses showed 30.2% probability of ACEi being not cost-effective in the ACE II/ID group, against an almost 100% probability of cost-effectiveness in the ACE DD group. A selective screen-and-treat strategy should incorporate an alternative therapy for patients with the ACE II/ID genotype with an at least 9.1% increase in survival time compared with ACEi therapy to be cost-effective. Sensitivity analyses show that higher effectiveness and lower costs of the alternative therapy improve the cost-effectiveness of a screening strategy. CONCLUSION: ACEi therapy is a cost-saving treatment compared with placebo in nondiabetic nephropathy, irrespective of ACE (I/D) genotype. However, ACEi therapy saved more costs and more health gains were achieved in the ACE DD genotype than in the ACE II/ID genotype.

6189,Lifestyle interventions for knee pain in overweight and obese adults aged > or = 45: economic evaluation of randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost effectiveness of four different lifestyle interventions for knee pain. DESIGN: Cost utility analysis of randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Five general practices in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 389 adults aged > or = 45 with self reported knee pain and body mass index (BMI) > or = 28. INTERVENTIONS: Dietary intervention plus quadriceps strengthening exercises, dietary intervention, quadriceps strengthening exercises, and leaflet provision. Participants received home visits over a two year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained over two years from a health service perspective. RESULTS: Advice leaflet was associated with a mean change in cost of -31 pounds sterling, and a mean QALY gain of 0.085. Both strengthening exercises and dietary intervention were more effective (0.090 and 0.133 mean QALY gain, respectively) but were not cost effective. Dietary intervention plus strengthening exercises had a mean cost of 647 pounds sterling and a mean QALY gain of 0.147 and was estimated to have an incremental cost of 10,469 pounds sterling per QALY gain (relative to leaflet provision), and a 23.1% probability of being cost effective at a 20,000 pounds sterling/QALY threshold.

6192,Cost-effectiveness analysis of an occupational therapy-led lifestyle approach and routine general practitioner's care for panic disorder,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an occupational therapy-led lifestyle approach to treating panic disorder in primary care compared with routine general practitioner's (GP) care. The burden of mental health disorders is considerable. Cost-effective interventions are necessary to alleviate some of these burdens. Habitual lifestyle behaviours influence mood, although to date mainly single lifestyle factor trials have been conducted to examine the effects on anxiety. METHODS: An economic evaluation was conducted alongside an unblinded pragmatic randomised controlled trial with assessment at 5 and 10 months. Costs and consequences, as measured by the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs), were compared using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: The occupational therapy-led lifestyle intervention was more costly than routine GP care at both 5 and 10 months. Significant outcome improvements were evident at 5 months when using the BAI, although these were not maintained at 10 months. Small differences in mean QALYs were found. The estimated ICER was pound36 per BAI improvement for 5 months and pound39 for 10 months, and pound18,905 per QALY gained for 5 months and pound8,283 for 10 months.

6194,Survival and outcome of neurosurgical patients requiring ventilatory support after intensive care unit stay,"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical outcome of severely ill neurosurgical patients whose need for artificial life support was extended. We sought to determine whether these patients benefit from extended treatment both in life expectancy and quality of life. Furthermore, we evaluated the direct cost of the neurosurgical treatment. METHODS: The study group comprised a consecutive series of 346 neurosurgical patients in poor condition who were discharged from the intensive care unit but still in need of artificial respiratory support. The patients had various neurosurgical diagnoses and were treated between 2000 and 2003 at the Department of Neurosurgery, Helsinki University Central Hospital. We followed the outcome of these patients by specially formatted questionnaires 6 months and 1, 2, and 5 years after treatment. Their health-related quality of life was evaluated with EuroQol EQ-5D; quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained with the treatment and the costs of a QALY were calculated. RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 5 years. The mortality rate was 27% at 30 days, 45% at 1 year, and 59% at 5 years after treatment. Of the patients, 20% had a good recovery (Glasgow Outcome Scale [GOS] scores 4 and 5), 18% had severe disability (GOS score 3), none was in a vegetative state (GOS score 2), 59% were dead (GOS score 1), and 3% were lost to follow-up. Of the survivors, 69% lived at home, 22% in a nursing home, 2% were in a hospital, and 7% were lost to follow-up. The median EQ-5D index value was lower than the median index value for the general population: 0.71 (25th percentile [Q1] 0.38 and 75th percentile [Q3] 0.85) versus 0.85 (Q1 0.73 and Q3 1.00). The median cost of the direct neurosurgical treatment per patient was 15,000 euros (25th percentile, 10,000 euros 75th percentile, 22,000 euros). Surviving patients gained a mean of 17 +/- 13 QALYs. The cost of 1 QALY was 2521 euros. CONCLUSION: Prolonged intensive care unit and step-down unit treatment of critically ill neurosurgical patients seems to be clinically justified. Moreover, direct costs of neurosurgical treatment were reasonably low.",2009-01-05509,19687698,Neurosurgery,Kirsi Malmivaara,2009,65 / 3,530-7; discussion 537-8,No,19687698,"Kirsi Malmivaara; Juha Hernesniemi; Ritva Salmenperä; Juha Ohman; Risto P Roine; Jari Siironen; Survival and outcome of neurosurgical patients requiring ventilatory support after intensive care unit stay, Neurosurgery, 2009-Sep; 65(3):0148-396X; 530-7; discussion 537-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Artificial respiratory support vs. No treatment,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,2521,Euro,2007,4314.45
6195,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of immediate radical cystectomy versus intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy for high-risk, high-grade (T1G3) bladder cancer","BACKGROUND:: Although both radical cystectomy and intravesical immunotherapy are initial treatment options for high-risk, T1, grade 3 (T1G3) bladder cancer, controversy regarding the optimal strategy persists. Because bladder cancer is the most expensive malignancy to treat per patient, decisions regarding the optimal treatment strategy should consider costs. METHODS:: A Markov Monte-Carlo cost-effectiveness model was created to simulate the outcomes of a cohort of patients with incident, high-risk, T1G3 bladder cancer. Treatment options included immediate cystectomy and conservative therapy with intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). The base case was a man aged 60 years. Parameter uncertainty was assessed with probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Scenario analyses were used to explore the 2 strategies among patients stratified by age and comorbidity. RESULTS:: The quality-adjusted survival with immediate cystectomy and BCG therapy was 9.46 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 9.39 QALYs, respectively. The corresponding mean per-patient discounted lifetime costs (in 2005 Canadian dollars) were $37,600 and $42,400, respectively. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY, the probability that immediate cystectomy was cost-effective was 67%. Immediate cystectomy was the dominant (more effective and less expensive) therapy for patients aged <60 years, whereas BCG therapy was dominant for patients aged >75 years. With increasing comorbidity, BCG therapy was dominant at lower age thresholds. CONCLUSIONS:: Compared with BCG therapy, immediate radical cystectomy for average patients with high-risk, T1G3 bladder cancer yielded better health outcomes and lower costs. Tailoring therapy based on patient age and comorbidity may increase survival while yielding significant cost-savings for the healthcare system. Cancer 2009.

The aim of our study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of five treatment strategies in patients diagnosed with RRMS (symptom management alone and in combination with subcutaneous glatiramer acetate, intramuscular interferon beta-1a, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, or intramuscular interferon [beta-1b) in a Balkan country in socio-economic transition. METHODS: The Markov model was developed based on the literature about effectiveness and on local Serbian cost calculations. The duration of a cycle in the model was set to a month. The baseline time horizon was 480 months (40 years). The societal perspective was used for costs and outcomes, and they were discounted for 3% annually. Monte Carlo micro simulation with 1000 virtual patients was done. RESULTS: Significant gain with immunomodulatory therapy was achieved only in relapse-free years, while the time spent in health states EDSS 0.0-5.5 was longer with symptomatic therapy only, and gains in life years and QALYs were only marginal. One QALY gained costs more than a billion of Serbian dinars (more than 20 million US dollars), making each of the four immunomodulatory therapies cost-ineffective.

6200,Prospective evaluation of a Colorectal Cancer Nurse Follow-up Clinic,"Introduction: Colorectal Nurse Specialist (CNS) clinics for post-operative follow-up of colorectal cancer aim to maintain clinical efficacy while reducing costs. We prospectively studied the efficacy and financial implications of this clinic. Method: This was a prospective study of all patients attending CNS clinics over 3 years. A lower risk protocol for Dukes' A patients and a higher risk protocol for Dukes' B, C and D patients was used over 3 and 5 years respectively. Department of Health Pricing Charts were used to cost the follow up protocols and adjustment was performed to calculate the cost of each QALY gained. Results: 193 patients entered into this nurse follow up clinic protocol between 2005 and 2007. Patients were Dukes' stage A:13.0%, B:35.8%, C:36.3% and D:9.3%. Ninety-seven percent underwent curative treatment and 2.6% had palliative treatment. Twenty-one percent of patients developed recurrent disease. Overall actuarial 5-year survival was 80%, recurrences had a 30% 5-year actuarial survival. The total cost per patient for three years follow-up was pound1506 and pound1179 for lower risk rectal and non-rectal cancers respectively. The adjusted cost for each QALY gained for lower risk tumours was pound1914. Total cost per patient with higher risk tumours was pound1814 and pound1487 for rectal and non-rectal tumours respectively. The adjusted cost for each QALY gained was pound2180 for higher risk tumours. Conclusions: This clinic demonstrated cost effective detection of recurrent disease. CT was the most sensitive alert test.
