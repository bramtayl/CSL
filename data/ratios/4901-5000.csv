4901,Surveillance of cirrhosis for hepatocellular carcinoma: a cost-utility analysis,"Using a decision-analytic model, we evaluated the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in individuals with cirrhosis. Separate cohorts with cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were simulated. Results were also combined to approximate a mixed aetiology population. Comparisons were made between a variety of surveillance algorithms using alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) assay and/or ultrasound at 6- and 12-monthly intervals. Parameter estimates were obtained from comprehensive literature reviews. Uncertainty was explored using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In the mixed aetiology cohort, 6-monthly AFP+ultrasound was predicted to be the most effective strategy. The model estimates that, compared with no surveillance, this strategy may triple the number of people with operable tumours at diagnosis and almost halve the number of people who die from HCC. The cheapest strategy employed triage with annual AFP (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER): 20,700 pounds per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained). At a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000 pounds per QALY the most cost-effective strategy used triage with 6-monthly AFP (ICER: 27,600 pounds per QALY gained). The addition of ultrasound to this strategy increased the ICER to 60,100 pounds per QALY gained. Surveillance appears most cost-effective in individuals with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, potentially due to younger age at diagnosis of cirrhosis. Our results suggest that, in a UK NHS context, surveillance of individuals with cirrhosis for HCC should be considered effective and cost-effective. The economic efficiency of different surveillance strategies is predicted to vary markedly according to cirrhosis aetiology.",2008-01-03867,18382459,Br J Cancer,J Thompson Coon,2008,98 / 7,1166-75,No,18382459,"J Thompson Coon; G Rogers; P Hewson; D Wright; R Anderson; S Jackson; S Ryder; M Cramp; K Stein; Surveillance of cirrhosis for hepatocellular carcinoma: a cost-utility analysis, Br J Cancer, 2008-Apr-08; 98(7):0007-0920; 1166-75",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,6--months alpha-foetoprotein triage surveillance vs. 6-months ultrasound surveilllance,Not Stated,70 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.50,3.50,58823.53,United Kingdom,2004,147728.44

4903,The potential cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia,"A clinical trial has shown that a live-attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine is effective against herpes zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN). The aim of this study was to examine the cost-effectiveness of vaccination against HZ and PHN in Canada. A cohort model was developed to estimate the burden of HZ and the cost-effectiveness of HZ vaccination, using Canadian population-based data. Different ages at vaccination were examined and probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed. The economic evaluation was conducted from the ministry of health perspective and 5% discounting was used for costs and benefits. In Canada (population=30 million), we estimate that each year there are 130,000 new cases of HZ, 17,000 cases of PHN and 20 deaths. Most of the pain and suffering is borne by adults over the age of 60 years and is due to PHN. Vaccinating 65-year-olds (HZ efficacy=63%, PHN efficacy=67%, no waning, cost/course=$150) is estimated to cost $33,000 per QALY-gained (90%CrI: 19,000-63,000). Assuming the cost per course of HZ vaccination is $150, probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggest that vaccinating between 65 and 75 years of age will likely yield cost-effectiveness ratios below $40,000 per Quality- Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) gained, while vaccinating adults older than 75 years will yield ratios less than $70,000 per QALY-gained. These results are most sensitive to the duration of vaccine protection and the cost of vaccination. In conclusion, results suggest that vaccinating adults between the ages of 65 and 75 years is likely to be cost-effective and thus to be a judicious use of scarce health care resources.",2008-01-03869,18382137,Hum Vaccin,Marc Brisson,2008,4 / 3,,No,18382137,"Marc Brisson; James Pellissier; St√©phanie Camden; Caroline Quach; Philippe De Wals; The potential cost-effectiveness of vaccination against herpes zoster and post-herpetic neuralgia, Hum Vaccin, 2008-Jan-25; 4(3):1554-8600",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Attenuated varicella-zoster virus vaccine vs. No vaccine,Not Stated,80 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,33152,Canada,2005,36286.5
4904,Cost-utility of repeated screening for Chlamydia trachomatis,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of repeated screening for chlamydia trachomatis at various time intervals compared to one-off screening of Dutch young adults. METHODS: We used a dynamic model to fully take the spread of the disease over time in the population into account, with data being used gathered within the context of a recently performed pilot study in The Netherlands. The screening frequencies analyzed were: every year, every 2 years, every 5 years, and every 10 years. The strategies were compared in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness, expressed as the net costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: For all interval strategies, with the exception of screening every year, incremental cost-effectiveness stays below the informal Dutch threshold of euro20,000 per QALY.

4909,Economic analysis of prophylactic pegfilgrastim in adult cancer patients receiving chemotherapy,"OBJECTIVES: Neutropenia and its complications, including febrile neutropenia (FN), are a common side effect of cancer chemotherapy. Results of clinical trials showed that prophylactic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF) is effective in preventing FN. In this study, the cost effectiveness (measured as cost per quality-adjusted time [days]) of three treatment alternatives were evaluated: no G-CSF, filgrastim administered daily for 7-12 days after chemotherapy, and a pegylated form of G-CSF pegfilgrastim, administered once per cycle. METHODS: A cost-utility model based on standard clinical practice of treating FN with immediate hospitalization or with ambulatory treatment, from a societal perspective was developed. Direct medical cost estimates for hospitalization were derived from claims data reported by 115 US academic medical centers. Indirect medical costs, productivity costs, probabilities, and utilities are based on published literature. Results were subjected to sensitivity analyses and 95% confidence intervals are based on a Monte Carlo simulation. RESULTS: Mean estimated costs/day of hospitalization were $1984 (SD $1040, N = 24,687) for surviving patients and $3139 (SD $2014, N = 1437) for dying patients. Under baseline conditions, pegfilgrastim dominated both filgrastim and no G-CSF, with expected costs and effectiveness of $4203 and 12.361 quality adjusted life-days (QALDs) for no G-CSF, $3058 and 12.967 QALDs for pegfilgrastim, and $5264 and 12.698 QALDs for filgrastim. CONCLUSIONS: This cost-utility analysis provides strong evidence that pegfilgrastim is not only cost-effective but also cost-saving in most common clinical and economic settings.

4911,Cost-effectiveness and value of information analyses of neuraminidase inhibitors for the treatment of influenza,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies for the treatment of suspected influenza in otherwise healthy adults and to identify future research priorities using value of information analysis. METHODS: A decision model was used to estimate the costs and effects, in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of amantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir for the treatment of influenza in otherwise healthy adults using data predominantly from meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation was conducted. The expected value of perfect information for the entire model and for individual parameters was calculated. RESULTS: Based on mean costs and effects, zanamivir is dominated by oseltamivir. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for amantadine (compared with no treatment) is pound 11,000 and pound 44,000 for oseltamivir (compared with amantadine). The probability that amantadine is cost-effective at a willingness to pay of pound 30,000 per QALY is 0.74, falling to 0.49 at pound 20,000 per QALY. Global expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is pound 2 m over 15 years if a willingness to pay threshold of pound 30,000 per QALY is assumed rising to pound 9.6 m at pound 45,000 per QALY. EVPI for only one parameter exceeds pound 500,0000 at pound 30,000 per QALY: the quality of life for untreated influenza. CONCLUSIONS: At traditionally accepted values of willingness to pay for health benefits, it is unlikely that additional research would be an efficient use of scarce resources. The only exception to this would be to examine the health-related quality of life impact of influenza in an untreated patient group.

Global expected value of perfect information (EVPI) is pound 2 m over 15 years if a willingness to pay threshold of pound 30,000 per QALY is assumed rising to pound 9.6 m at pound 45,000 per QALY. EVPI for only one parameter exceeds pound 500,0000 at pound 30,000 per QALY: the quality of life for untreated influenza. CONCLUSIONS: At traditionally accepted values of willingness to pay for health benefits, it is unlikely that additional research would be an efficient use of scarce resources. The only exception to this would be to examine the health-related quality of life impact of influenza in an untreated patient group. If a higher threshold value were acceptable, there are a small group of parameters that may warrant further investigation.

4915,Probabilistic cost-effectiveness modeling of different breast cancer screening policies in Slovenia,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the most cost-effective screening policy for population-based mammography breast cancer screening in Slovenia using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. METHODS: A time-dependent Markov model for breast cancer was constructed. General principles of cost-effectiveness analysis with multiple strategies were used to compare the costs and effects of 36 different screening policies. Using probability distributions for model parameters, the true effect of uncertainty across model input parameters on expected costs and effects was explored. The results from probabilistic simulation analysis are presented in a form of cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier. RESULTS: With the presented analysis, it was shown that a 1-year screening interval in population breast cancer screening would produce less benefits at higher costs than less intensive screening and that a 2-year interval would be cost-effective only at high values of society's willingness to pay per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Therefore, the optimal screening policy should be chosen among 3-year-interval policies. CONCLUSIONS: Based on commonly quoted thresholds of society's willingness to pay per QALY of $50,000, the optimal approach in the Slovenian population would be screening women aged from 40 to 80 years every 3 years.",2008-01-03880,18380626,Value Health,Klemen Rojnik,2008,11 / 2,139-48,Yes,18380626,"Klemen Rojnik; Klemen Naversnik; Tatjana Mateovic-Rojnik; Maja Primiczakelj; Probabilistic cost-effectiveness modeling of different breast cancer screening policies in Slovenia, Value Health, 2008 Mar-Apr; 11(2):1098-3015; 139-48",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Breast cancer screening 3 times a year in women aged 40-80 years vs. Breast cancer creening 3 times a year in women aged 40-75 years,Not Stated,40 Years,40 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,41816,Euro,2004,71260.62
4916,HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B: cost-effectiveness of peginterferon alfa-2a compared to lamivudine in Taiwan,"OBJECTIVE: In Taiwan, the carrier rate of hepatitis B surface antigen is 15% to 20%, one of the highest in the world. Among chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative accounts for approximately 40% to 50% of these patients. A recent study found that peginterferon alfa-2a (40 KD) is more effective than lamivudine in treating HBeAg-negative CHB, but its cost-effectiveness has not been evaluated. Our objective is to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness of 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a compared to 48 weeks of lamivudine, from the perspective of the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance. METHODS: A Markov model was used to simulate the natural history of HBeAg-negative CHB in a cohort of 40-year-old patients. Efficacy, disease progression, economic, and quality-of-life data were derived from published literature and a survey of clinical experts in Taiwan. Life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs in New Taiwan Dollars (NTD) (1 USD = 31.96 NTD), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. RESULTS: The gain in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa-2a compared to 48 weeks of lamivudine was 0.45 at an additional cost of 157,000 NTD (4900 USD), resulting in an ICER of 347,000 NTD (10,900 USD) per QALY gained. The 95% central range for the ICER from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was 228,000-566,000 NTD (7100-17,700 USD).

4918,The costs and cost-effectiveness of an integrated sepsis treatment protocol,"CONTEXT: Sepsis is associated with high mortality and treatment costs. International guidelines recommend the implementation of integrated sepsis protocols; however, the true cost and cost-effectiveness of these are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of an integrated sepsis protocol, as compared with conventional care. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of consecutive patients presenting with septic shock and enrolled in the institution's integrated sepsis protocol. Clinical and economic outcomes were compared with a historical control cohort. SETTING: Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. PATIENTS: Overall, 79 patients presenting to the emergency department with septic shock in the treatment cohort and 51 patients in the control group. INTERVENTIONS: An integrated sepsis treatment protocol incorporating empirical antibiotics, early goal-directed therapy, intensive insulin therapy, lung-protective ventilation, and consideration for drotrecogin alfa and steroid therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital treatment costs were collected using the hospital's detailed accounting system. The cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the perspective of the healthcare system using a lifetime horizon. The primary end point for the cost-effectiveness analysis was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained. RESULTS: Mortality in the treatment group was 20.3% vs. 29.4% in the control group (p = .23). Implementing an integrated sepsis protocol resulted in a mean increase in cost of approximately $8,800 per patient, largely driven by increased intensive care unit length of stay. Life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years were higher in the treatment group; 0.78 and 0.54, respectively. The protocol was associated with an incremental cost of $11,274 per life-year saved and a cost of $16,309 per quality-adjusted life year gained.

4919,Is minimally invasive harvesting of the great saphenous vein for coronary artery bypass surgery a cost-effective technique?,"OBJECTIVE: In this study we aim to assess the cost-effectiveness analysis of minimally invasive vein harvesting. The great saphenous vein is the most commonly used conduit in coronary artery bypass surgery. In the past decade minimally invasive techniques have been developed to reduce the surgical trauma associated with the conventional open vein-harvesting technique. There is strong evidence to suggest that minimally invasive harvesting can reduce postoperative wound healing complications, pain, mobility restriction, and hospital stay. Despite the increasingly widespread use of this technique, formal cost-effectiveness analysis has never been performed. METHODS: Economic analysis was performed according to the National Institute of Healthcare and Clinical Excellence guidelines on the evaluation of technology by using published data on postoperative pain and mobility restriction, locally collected data, National Health Service reference costs, and manufacturer's data. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate and quantify the uncertainty associated with the results of our analysis. RESULTS: The results of our analysis demonstrate that minimally invasive vein harvesting was more cost-effective, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $19,858.87/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), comparing favorably with other health care interventions. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated with 95.6% certainty that endoscopic harvesting was more cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000/quality-adjusted life year. Alternative analysis suggested that even with considerable uncertainty associated with quality of life after vein harvesting, minimally invasive harvesting was more cost-effective than conventional vein harvesting. CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive harvesting is the most cost-effective method of harvesting the great saphenous vein and can significantly improve a patient's quality of life.",2008-01-03887,18374760,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,Christopher Rao,2008,135 / 4,809-15,No,18374760,"Christopher Rao; Omer Aziz; Samer Deeba; Andre Chow; Catherine Jones; Zhifang Ni; Leonidas Papastavrou; Shamim Rahman; Ara Darzi; Thanos Athanasiou; Is minimally invasive harvesting of the great saphenous vein for coronary artery bypass surgery a cost-effective technique?, J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg, 2008-Apr; 135(4):0022-5223; 809-15",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Minimally invasive endoscopic vein harvesting of the great saphenous vein vs. Conventional open vein-harvesting,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,19858.87,United States,2005,26316.92

AIM: To examine the clinical and economic outcomes of potential treatment strategies and durations for HBeAg-negative CHB. METHODS: We conducted a cost-utility analysis from a payer perspective over a lifetime time horizon. Disease progression probabilities, costs and quality of life data were derived from the literature. We evaluated 5-year, 10-year, lifetime and 5 on-1 off treatment durations. For each of these treatment durations, we evaluated initial therapy with entecavir, lamivudine or adefovir, with addition of adefovir or entecavir for patients who developed virological breakthrough because of resistance (12 strategies total). RESULTS: Increasing treatment duration improved quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and was generally cost-effective for all three drugs. However, a 5 on-1 off strategy was the most cost-effective: lifetime vs. 5 on-1 off entecavir had an ICER of $148,200/QALY. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses, entecavir 5 on-1 off was the preferred strategy over the range of commonly reimbursed cost-effectiveness thresholds. Lifetime treatment was preferred to a 5 on-1 off strategy, if treatment durability was < 10%.

4931,The challenge of conducting pharmacoeconomic evaluations in oncology using crossover trials: the example of sunitinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumour,"This paper examines the challenge of conducting economic evaluations to support patient access to cancer therapies when the cost-effectiveness estimation is hampered by crossover trial design. To demonstrate these limitations, we present the submission to the Canadian Drug Review (CDR) of a cost-effectiveness evaluation of sunitinib versus best supportive care (BSC) for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumour in patients intolerant or resistant to imatinib. The economic model generated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for sunitinib versus BSC of dollars 79,884/quality-adjusted life-year gained. Eight months after initial submission, CDR granted a final recommendation to fund sunitinib following the manufacturer's appeal against their first recommendation. Although cost-effectiveness is an important consideration in reimbursement decisions, there is a need for improved decision-making processes for cancer drugs, as well as a better understanding of the limitations of clinical trial design.",2008-01-03894,18372169,Eur J Cancer,Isabelle Chabot,2008,44 / 7,972-7,No,18372169,"Isabelle Chabot; Jacques LeLorier; Martin E Blackstein; The challenge of conducting pharmacoeconomic evaluations in oncology using crossover trials: the example of sunitinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumour, Eur J Cancer, 2008-May; 44(7):0959-8049; 972-7",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sunitinib vs. Best supportive care,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,5.00,5.00,79884,Canada,2005,87436.99

METHODS: The pan-European SOHO study is a 3-year, prospective, outpatient, observational study of outcomes associated with antipsychotic treatment, focusing on olanzapine, in ten European countries. For the cost-utility analysis, healthcare resource use (inpatient care, day care, outpatient psychiatric consultations and antipsychotic and concomitant medication use) and EQ-5D data were collected at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. The perspective was that of the health service payer. UK healthcare unit costs (year 2004 values) were applied to the resource use data for the ten countries. UK population tariffs were applied to the EQ-5D data to determine utility values.An Epoch analysis was used to analyze the longitudinal data. Multivariate regression analyses that adjusted for baseline covariates were used to estimate the incremental cost and utility gains for patients treated with olanzapine compared with each of the other antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, amisulpride, clozapine and oral or depot typical antipsychotics). RESULTS: A total of 10 972 patients were enrolled at baseline, of which 9107 completed the 12-month study period. Treatment with olanzapine was more effective in terms of QALYs gained than all of the other antipsychotic treatments. Treatment with olanzapine dominated quetiapine and amisulpride. The incremental cost for olanzapine compared with risperidone was pound sterling 226 per patient over 12 months and the incremental cost per QALY gained was pound 5156, with bootstrap analyses showing 100% of the replications falling below a pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained threshold. Compared with treatment with clozapine, olanzapine was found to be marginally more effective, at an additional cost of pound sterling 13 per patient over 12 months and to have an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound sterling 775. Bootstrap analyses showed that 81% of replications fell below a pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained threshold. Comparing olanzapine with oral and depot typical antipsychotics, the incremental cost was pound sterling 849 and pound sterling 1106 per patient over 12 months and the incremental cost per QALY gained was pound sterling 15 696 and pound sterling 23 331, respectively. Bootstrap analyses showed that 98% of the replications fell below a pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained threshold for the comparison with oral typical antipsychotics, and 79% of replications for the comparison with depot preparations. CONCLUSIONS: Among SOHO patients, if a funding threshold of pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained is assumed, this analysis suggests that olanzapine has a high probability of being the most cost-effective treatment compared with other antipsychotic treatments.

Bootstrap analyses showed that 98% of the replications fell below a pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained threshold for the comparison with oral typical antipsychotics, and 79% of replications for the comparison with depot preparations. CONCLUSIONS: Among SOHO patients, if a funding threshold of pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained is assumed, this analysis suggests that olanzapine has a high probability of being the most cost-effective treatment compared with other antipsychotic treatments.

4937,Cost-utility analysis of treatment with olanzapine compared with other antipsychotic treatments in patients with schizophrenia in the pan-European SOHO study,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the cost utility of treating schizophrenic patients with olanzapine compared with other antipsychotics in a naturalistic outpatient setting. METHODS: The pan-European SOHO study is a 3-year, prospective, outpatient, observational study of outcomes associated with antipsychotic treatment, focusing on olanzapine, in ten European countries. For the cost-utility analysis, healthcare resource use (inpatient care, day care, outpatient psychiatric consultations and antipsychotic and concomitant medication use) and EQ-5D data were collected at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months. The perspective was that of the health service payer. UK healthcare unit costs (year 2004 values) were applied to the resource use data for the ten countries. UK population tariffs were applied to the EQ-5D data to determine utility values.An Epoch analysis was used to analyze the longitudinal data. Multivariate regression analyses that adjusted for baseline covariates were used to estimate the incremental cost and utility gains for patients treated with olanzapine compared with each of the other antipsychotics (risperidone, quetiapine, amisulpride, clozapine and oral or depot typical antipsychotics). RESULTS: A total of 10 972 patients were enrolled at baseline, of which 9107 completed the 12-month study period. Treatment with olanzapine was more effective in terms of QALYs gained than all of the other antipsychotic treatments. Treatment with olanzapine dominated quetiapine and amisulpride. The incremental cost for olanzapine compared with risperidone was pound sterling 226 per patient over 12 months and the incremental cost per QALY gained was pound 5156, with bootstrap analyses showing 100% of the replications falling below a pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained threshold. Compared with treatment with clozapine, olanzapine was found to be marginally more effective, at an additional cost of pound sterling 13 per patient over 12 months and to have an incremental cost per QALY gained of pound sterling 775. Bootstrap analyses showed that 81% of replications fell below a pound sterling 30 000 per QALY gained threshold. Comparing olanzapine with oral and depot typical antipsychotics, the incremental cost was pound sterling 849 and pound sterling 1106 per patient over 12 months and the incremental cost per QALY gained was pound sterling 15 696 and pound sterling 23 331, respectively.

4938,An economic evaluation of atorvastatin for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: The CARDS trial, a multicentre, randomized, controlled trial, found that atorvastatin 10 mg/day for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol significantly reduced cardiovascular (CV) events, including stroke. We estimated the cost effectiveness of atorvastatin as primary prevention against CV disease from the short-term and lifetime US payer perspectives. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We constructed a decision analytic (Markov) model to evaluate long-term costs and outcomes for atorvastatin 10 mg/day versus no HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes and no history of a CV event. CV event rates and survival were based on risk equations calibrated to CARDS and applied to a US type 2 diabetes population; the atorvastatin effect on CV events was based on hazard ratios from CARDS; direct medical care costs were based on US treatment patterns and published costs analyses of patients with diabetes. Costs were valued in $US, year 2005 values; costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum. RESULTS: Within the time horizon of the trial (5 years), the cost effectiveness of atorvastatin was $US137 276 per QALY. At 10 years, the incremental cost per QALY improved to $US3640 per QALY. At 25 years, overall costs were lower and QALYs higher in the atorvastatin arm. Costs of managing CV events were lower after 5 years for patients treated with atorvastatin. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with type 2 diabetes and one additional risk factor for CV disease, normal LDL-cholesterol and no history of a CV event, primary prevention with atorvastatin appears to be cost saving and improve outcomes over 25 years, although it is costly from a short-term US payer perspective.

4941,Cost effectiveness of ibandronate for the prevention of fractures in inflammatory bowel disease-related osteoporosis: cost-utility analysis using a Markov model,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a frequent complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies have shown bisphosphonates to considerably reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis, and preventing fractures with bisphosphonates has been reported to be cost effective in older populations. However, no studies of the cost effectiveness of these agents in preventing fractures in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are available. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost effectiveness of the bisphosphonate ibandronate combined with calcium/colecalciferol ('ibandronate') in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis due to inflammatory bowel disease in Germany. Treatment strategies used for comparison were sodium fluoride combined with calcium/colecalciferol ('fluoride') and calcium/colecalciferol ('calcium') alone. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) were adjusted and predicted for a standardized population receiving each respective treatment. A Markov model was developed, with probabilities of transition to fracture states consisting of BMD-dependent and -independent components. The BMD-dependent component was assessed using predicted change in BMD from the RCT. The independent component captured differences in bone quality and micro-architecture resulting from prevalent fractures or treatment with anti-resorptive drugs.The analysis was conducted for a population with a mean age of the RCT patients (women aged 36 years, men aged 38 years) with osteopenia (T-score about -2.0 at baseline), a population of the same age with osteoporosis (T-score of -3.0 at baseline) and for an older population (both sexes aged 65 years) with osteoporosis (T-score of -3.0). Outcomes were measured as costs per QALY gained from a societal perspective. The treatment duration in the RCT was 42 months. A 5-year period was assumed to follow, during which the treatment effects linearly declined to 0. The simulation time was 10 years.Prices for medication and treatment were presented as year 2004 values; costs and effects were discounted at 5%. To test the robustness of the results, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (Monte Carlo simulation) were conducted. RESULTS: The calcium strategy dominated the fluoride strategy. When the ibandronate strategy was compared with the calcium strategy, the base-case cost-effectiveness ratios (costs per QALY gained) were between euro 407 375 for an older female population with osteoporosis and euro 6 516 345 for a younger female population with osteopenia. Univariate sensitivity analyses resulted in variations between 4% of base-case results and dominance of calcium. In Monte Carlo simulations, conducted for the various populations, the probability of an ICER of ibandronate below euro 50 000 per QALY was never greater than 20.2%.

4946,Cost effectiveness of ibandronate for the prevention of fractures in inflammatory bowel disease-related osteoporosis: cost-utility analysis using a Markov model,"BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a frequent complication in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Recent studies have shown bisphosphonates to considerably reduce fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis, and preventing fractures with bisphosphonates has been reported to be cost effective in older populations. However, no studies of the cost effectiveness of these agents in preventing fractures in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are available. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cost effectiveness of the bisphosphonate ibandronate combined with calcium/colecalciferol ('ibandronate') in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis due to inflammatory bowel disease in Germany. Treatment strategies used for comparison were sodium fluoride combined with calcium/colecalciferol ('fluoride') and calcium/colecalciferol ('calcium') alone. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A cost-utility analysis was conducted using data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Changes in bone mineral density (BMD) were adjusted and predicted for a standardized population receiving each respective treatment. A Markov model was developed, with probabilities of transition to fracture states consisting of BMD-dependent and -independent components. The BMD-dependent component was assessed using predicted change in BMD from the RCT. The independent component captured differences in bone quality and micro-architecture resulting from prevalent fractures or treatment with anti-resorptive drugs.The analysis was conducted for a population with a mean age of the RCT patients (women aged 36 years, men aged 38 years) with osteopenia (T-score about -2.0 at baseline), a population of the same age with osteoporosis (T-score of -3.0 at baseline) and for an older population (both sexes aged 65 years) with osteoporosis (T-score of -3.0). Outcomes were measured as costs per QALY gained from a societal perspective. The treatment duration in the RCT was 42 months. A 5-year period was assumed to follow, during which the treatment effects linearly declined to 0. The simulation time was 10 years.Prices for medication and treatment were presented as year 2004 values; costs and effects were discounted at 5%. To test the robustness of the results, univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (Monte Carlo simulation) were conducted. RESULTS: The calcium strategy dominated the fluoride strategy. When the ibandronate strategy was compared with the calcium strategy, the base-case cost-effectiveness ratios (costs per QALY gained) were between euro 407 375 for an older female population with osteoporosis and euro 6 516 345 for a younger female population with osteopenia. Univariate sensitivity analyses resulted in variations between 4% of base-case results and dominance of calcium. In Monte Carlo simulations, conducted for the various populations, the probability of an ICER of ibandronate below euro 50 000 per QALY was never greater than 20.2%.

4947,A health economic analysis of screening and optimal treatment of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in the USA,"BACKGROUND: Nephropathy is an indicator of end-organ damage and is a strong predictor of an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and death in patients with diabetes. Screening can lead to early identification and treatment, both of which incur costs. However, identification and treatment may slow or prevent progression to a more expensive stage of the disease and thus may save money. We assessed the health economic impact of screening for nephropathy (microalbuminuria and overt nephropathy) followed by optimal renoprotective-based antihypertensive therapy in a US setting. METHODS: A Markov model simulated the lifetime impact of screening with semi-quantitative urine dipsticks in a primary care setting of hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes and subsequent treatment with irbesartan 300 mg in patients identified as having nephropathy. Progression from no nephropathy to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) was simulated. Probabilities, utilities, medication and ESRD treatment costs came from published sources. Clinical outcomes and direct medical costs were projected. Second order Monte Carlo simulation was used to account for uncertainty in multiple parameters. Annual discount rates of 3% were used where appropriate. RESULTS: Screening, followed by optimized treatment, led to a 44% reduction in the cumulative incidence of ESRD and improvements in non-discounted life expectancy of 0.25 +/- 0.22 years/patient (mean +/- SD). Quality-adjusted life expectancy was improved by 0.18 +/- 0.15 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)/patient and direct costs increased by $244 +/- 3499/patient. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was $20 011 per QALY gained for screening and optimized treatment versus no screening. There was a 77% probability that screening and optimized therapy would be considered cost effective with a willingness to pay a threshold of $50 000. CONCLUSION: In patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension, screening for nephropathy and treatment with a renoprotective-based antihypertensive agent was projected to improve patient outcomes and represent excellent value in a US setting.",2008-01-03910,18359872,Nephrol Dial Transplant,Andrew J Palmer,2008,23 / 4,1216-23,No,18359872,"Andrew J Palmer; William J Valentine; Roland Chen; Nazanin Mehin; Sylvie Gabriel; Bruno Bregman; Roger A Rodby; A health economic analysis of screening and optimal treatment of nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypertension in the USA, Nephrol Dial Transplant, 2008-Apr; 23(4):0931-0509; 1216-23",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Screening for nephropathy (microalbuminuria and overt nephropathy), followed by optimal treatment vs. No screening, followed by optimal treatment",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,20011,United States,2000,30075.88

DESIGN: A probabilistic decision analytical model of HIV/AIDS progression in children based on the CD4 cell percentage (CD4%) was populated with data from the placebo-controlled Children with HIV Antibiotic Prophylaxis trial that had reported a 43% reduction in mortality with cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected children aged 1-14 years. METHODS: Unit costs (US$ in 2006) were measured at University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka. Cost-effectiveness expressed as cost per life-year saved, cost per quality adjusted life-year (QALY) saved, cost per disability adjusted life-year (DALY) averted was calculated across a number of different scenarios at tertiary and primary healthcare centres. RESULTS:: Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was associated with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of US$72 per life-year saved, US$94 per QALY saved and US$53 per DALY averted, i.e. substantially less than a cost-effectiveness threshold of US$1019 per outcome (gross domestic product per capita, Zambia 2006). ICERs of US$5 or less per outcome demonstrate that cotrimoxazole prophylaxis is even more cost-effective at the local healthcare level.

4957,A cost-effectiveness analysis of delayed sphincteroplasty for anal sphincter injury,"Objective Anal-sphincter injury may result in faecal incontinence. Sphincteroplasty is usually performed as a primary (immediate) procedure. Delayed sphincteroplasty (DS) can be performed if there is significant trauma or soiling, if the primary procedure has failed, and if the injury was not recognized initially. This study aimed to determine the cost to patient and health service in the event a DS is performed. Method Patients with anal-sphincter-injury who underwent primary sphincteroplasty (PS)/DS were identified from the published literature (primary, n = 103; delayed, n = 777) using Medline, Embase, Ovid and Cochrane databases for studies published between 1976 and 2006. Studies included described at least one of the measured outcomes - probability of functional success/failure and quality of life (QOL). An economic model was constructed and decision analysis performed using a decision tree based on a Markov process. Main outcomes were quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) gained from each strategy, costs incurred and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over a 10- and 15-year time horizon. Results Over 10 years, primary sphincteroplasty (PS) produced a gain of 5.72 QALYs for an estimated pound2750, giving an ICER of pound487 per QALY. DS produced a gain of 3.73 QALYs for a cost of pound2667, giving an ICER of pound719 per QALY. Both procedures fell below the pound10 000 per QALY willingness-to-pay threshold, but PS produced the highest QALYs. Both procedures performed poorly beyond the 10-year mark.

4961,Evaluating health care programs by combining cost with quality of life measures: a case study comparing capitation and fee for service,"OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) for evaluating different reimbursement models. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: The CEA used an observational study comparing fee for service (FFS) versus capitation for Medicaid cases with severe mental illness (n=522). Under capitation, services were provided either directly (direct capitation [DC]) by not-for-profit community mental health centers (CMHC), or in a joint venture between CMHCs and a for-profit managed behavioral health organization (MBHO). STUDY DESIGN: A nonparametric matching method (genetic matching) was used to identify those cases that minimized baseline differences across the groups. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were reported for each group. Incremental QALYs were valued at different thresholds for a QALY gained, and combined with cost estimates to plot cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: QALYs were similar across reimbursement models. Compared with FFS, the MBHO model had incremental costs of -$1,991 and the probability that this model was cost-effective exceeded 0.90. The DC model had incremental costs of $4,694; the probability that this model was cost-effective compared with FFS was <0.10.

4964,The cost-effectiveness of counseling strategies to improve adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy among men who have sex with men,"OBJECTIVE: Inadequate adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) may lead to poor health outcomes and the development of HIV strains that are resistant to HAART. The authors developed a model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of counseling interventions to improve adherence to HAART among men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: The authors developed a dynamic compartmental model that incorporates HIV treatment, adherence to treatment, and infection transmission and progression. All data estimates were obtained from secondary sources. The authors evaluated a counseling intervention given prior to initiation of HAART and before all changes in drug regimens, combined with phone-in support while on HAART. They considered a moderate-prevalence and a high-prevalence population of MSM. RESULTS: If the impact of HIV transmission is ignored, the counseling intervention has a cost-effectiveness ratio of $25,500 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. When HIV transmission is included, the cost-effectiveness ratio is much lower: $7400 and $8700 per QALY gained in the moderate- and high-prevalence populations, respectively. When the intervention is twice as costly per counseling session and half as effective as estimated in the base case (in terms of the number of individuals who become highly adherent, and who remain highly adherent), then the intervention costs $17,100 and $19,600 per QALY gained in the 2 populations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Counseling to improve adherence to HAART increased length of life, modestly reduced HIV transmission, and cost substantially less than $50,000 per QALY gained over a wide range of assumptions but did not reduce the proportion of drug-resistant strains.

4966,Cost-effectiveness of reducing wait times for cataract surgery in Ontario,"BACKGROUND: Reducing wait times for cataract surgery is a priority in Ontario. However, no previous analysis has determined whether the extra treatment volumes required to reduce wait times are of good monetary value when compared with allocating those same financial resources to new programs, drugs, or technologies. The objective of the study was to use queuing models to determine the cost-effectiveness of reducing, to target levels, wait times for cataract surgery at the provincial level within 1 to 10 years by increasing treatment volumes. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed by estimating the extra treatment volume required to reduce wait times using queuing model methodology. The cost of these extra treatments was obtained from Ontario provincial data. The incremental benefits of surgery are improvements in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and these values were obtained from the clinical literature. Incremental costs were compared with incremental benefits to determine an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. RESULTS: To reach the publicly stated target wait times, annual treatment volumes must increase by 4%. An extra increase in treatment volumes of 25,660 must also be provided for the transition period from the current wait time. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is $17,829 per QALY if the target wait time is achieved in 5 years, and this ratio is less than the common threshold for approval of new interventions, of $50,000 per QALY.

4976,The cost-effectiveness of a universal influenza vaccination program for adults aged 50-64 years in Australia,"Currently the Australian government funds universal influenza vaccine for all those aged > or =65 years under the National Immunisation Program (NIP). Annual vaccination rates in those aged 50-64 years are significantly lower than vaccination rates in those aged > or =65 years, and currently less than half those at high-risk of influenza-related complications aged 50-64 years are immunised. This study used a decision tree model to examine the cost-effectiveness of lowering the age threshold for the influenza NIP in Australia to include those aged 50-64 years. From a healthcare payer perspective, a new influenza vaccination policy would cost $8908/QALY gained. From a societal perspective, a new influenza vaccination policy would cost $8338/QALY gained. From a governmental perspective, a new influenza vaccination policy would cost $22,408/QALY gained. The most influential parameters in deterministic sensitivity analysis included: probability of death due to influenza, vaccine efficacy against mortality, vaccine uptake, vaccine cost, and vaccine administration cost. Influenza vaccination for people aged 50-64 years appears highly cost-effective, and should be a strong candidate for funding under the NIP.",2008-01-03933,18343537,Vaccine,Anthony T Newall,2008,26 / 17,2142-53,Yes,18343537,"Anthony T Newall; Paul A Scuffham; Heath Kelly; Stuart Harsley; C Raina Macintyre; The cost-effectiveness of a universal influenza vaccination program for adults aged 50-64 years in Australia, Vaccine, 2008-Apr-16; 26(17):1873-2518; 2142-53",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Universal influenza vaccination vs. Usual care (vaccination available but not universal),Not Stated,64 Years,50 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,5.00,8338,Australia,2005,8427.21
4977,Economic evaluation of sunitinib malate in second-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Finland,"Background: Cytokine therapy is currently used as first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Until recently, treatments with proven efficacy after the failure of first-line cytokine therapy were not available. In recent clinical trials, sunitinib has been associated with good response rates in patients with mRCC. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the cost-effectiveness of sunitinib as second-line therapy for cytokine-refractory mRCC compared with current routine clinical practice in Finland (ie, best supportive care [BSC], including palliative biochemotherapy). Methods: A probabilistic decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of sunitinib. Data were gathered from clinical trials, literature sources, and expert opinions, as well as from a local sample (n = 39) from 2 university hospitals in Finland. Clinical experts treating patients with mRCC in Finland provided the information on care practices of prescribing sunitinib. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the health care payer in Finland. Results: According to estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), 1 progression-free month gained cost euro4802 (2005 Euros); 1 life-year gained cost euro30,831; and 1 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained cost euro43,698, compared with BSC, in the treatment of mRCC. The expected mean cost in BSC was euro5543. When parameter uncertainty was considered, the probability of sunitinib being the more cost-effective choice of treatment was ~70% at the willingness-to-pay level of euro45,000/QALY gained. Conclusions: Based on the results of this cost-effectiveness analysis, sunitinib is potentially cost-effective as a second-line treatment of mRCC compared with the treatment currently practiced in Finnish hospitals. The ICER (euro/QALY gained) obtained in the present study was less than the value considered suitable for novel oncology treatments.",2008-01-03934,18343276,Clin Ther,Timo Purmonen,2008,30 / 2,382-92,Yes,18343276,"Timo Purmonen; Janne A Martikainen; Erkki J O Soini; Vesa Kataja; Riikka-Liisa Vuorinen; Pirkko-Liisa Kellokumpu-Lehtinen; Economic evaluation of sunitinib malate in second-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma in Finland, Clin Ther, 2008-Feb; 30(2):1879-114X; 382-92",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Sunitinib vs. Best supportive care, standard therapy: second-line therapy as prescribed by Finnish health standards",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,43698,Euro,2005,72088.56
4978,Cost-effectiveness of usual general practitioner care with or without antidepressant medication for patients with minor or mild-major depression,"BACKGROUND: Minor depression is common in primary care and associated with increased health care costs. Many mildly depressed patients are prescribed antidepressants, although there is insufficient information on the cost-effectiveness of antidepressants for these patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether usual care without antidepressants is equivalent to (i.e. as effective as and as expensive as) usual care with antidepressants in patients with minor or mild-major depression. METHODS: Severity of depression was measured using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using the EuroQol. Resource use was measured from a societal perspective using cost diaries. Bootstrapping was used to analyze the cost-effectiveness data. RESULTS: Equivalence could not be shown for improvement in MADRS score or QALYs gained at 52 weeks. The mean (95% CI) difference in total costs between usual care without antidepressants and usual care with antidepressants was -euro751 (-3601; 1522). Using an equivalence margin of euro500 equivalence in costs could not be shown. In the cost-effectiveness analyses equivalence also could not be shown. LIMITATIONS: This study was underpowered for economic outcomes. Another limitation was the loss-to-follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although equivalence could not be shown in the costs and cost-effectiveness analyses, 95% confidence intervals also did not show that usual care without antidepressants was vastly superior or inferior to usual care with antidepressants.

4979,Screening for familial intracranial aneurysms: decision and cost-effectiveness analysis,"RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potential benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms in family members of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a Markov model, we performed a decision and cost-effectiveness analysis comparing magnetic resonance (MR) angiography screening for asymptomatic, unruptured intracranial aneurysms to no screening in family members of patients with aneurysmal SAH. Treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms was determined according to patient age and aneurysm size and location. Cohort age was taken as 40 years. RESULTS: In family members with two or more affected first-degree relatives, screening compared with no screening had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $37,400 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). With screening, life expectancy increased from 39.44 years to 39.55 years. The ICER of screening was >$50,000 per QALY if age at screening was > or =50 years.

4981,Cost effectiveness of the Expert Patients Programme (EPP) for patients with chronic conditions,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost effectiveness of the Expert Patients Programme (EPP) intervention compared to a treatment as usual alternative. DESIGN: Two-arm pragmatic randomised controlled trial design with waiting list control. SETTING: Community settings in England. PATIENTS: Patients with a wide range of self-defined long-term conditions. INTERVENTION: The EPP based on the US chronic disease self management program (CDSMP), a lay-led self-care group involving six weekly sessions to teach self-care support skills. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs estimated over a 6-month period from a societal perspective. Health outcomes estimated in terms of quality adjusted life years (QALYs) generated by patients' response to the EQ5D at baseline and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: The intervention group is associated with better patient outcomes, at slightly lower cost. Specifically, the intervention group has a 0.020 QALY gain compared with the control group, and a reduced cost of around 27 pounds per patient. The intervention would therefore be considered dominant. While the QALYs gained are small in absolute terms, an additional 0.02 QALY is equivalent to an extra one week of perfect health per year. When the value of a QALY is 20,000 pounds the EPP has a probability of 94% of being cost effective. Indeed, for all plausible values of willingness-to-pay for a QALY the EPP group is more likely to be cost effective than the control group.

DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis based on a Markov model. SETTING: National Health Service (NHS) Trusts in England and Wales. POPULATION: Women for whom surgical treatment for uterine fibroids is being considered. METHODS: The parameters of the Markov model of the treatment of uterine fibroids are drawn from a series of clinical studies of MRgFUS, and from the clinical effectiveness literature. Health-related quality of life is measured using the 6D. Costs are estimated from the perspective of the NHS. The impact of uncertainty is examined using deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness measured by cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The base-case results imply a cost saving and a small QALY gain per woman as a result of an MRgFUS treatment strategy. The cost per QALY gained is sensitive to cost of MRgFUS relative to other treatments, the age of the woman and the nonperfused volume relative to the total fibroids volume.

STUDY DESIGN: Based on a Kaiser Permanente study showing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) improvements related to SMBG frequency, a validated model was used to project 40-year clinical and economic outcomes for SMBG at 1 or 3 times per day vs no SMBG. METHODS: Baseline mean HbA1C (8.6%), age, and sex of the simulated cohort came from the Kaiser analysis of new SMBG users of OAD agents for T2DM. Other cohort characteristics, transition probabilities, utilities, and direct costs (from a US public payer perspective) were derived from relevant literature.

STUDY DESIGN: Based on a Kaiser Permanente study showing glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) improvements related to SMBG frequency, a validated model was used to project 40-year clinical and economic outcomes for SMBG at 1 or 3 times per day vs no SMBG. METHODS: Baseline mean HbA1C (8.6%), age, and sex of the simulated cohort came from the Kaiser analysis of new SMBG users of OAD agents for T2DM. Other cohort characteristics, transition probabilities, utilities, and direct costs (from a US public payer perspective) were derived from relevant literature. Outcomes were discounted at 3% per annum, with sensitivity analyses performed on discount rates and time horizons. RESULTS: Compared with no SMBG, quality-adjusted life expectancy increased with SMBG frequency. Increases were 0.103 and 0.327 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for SMBG at 1 and 3 times per day, respectively.

4987,A Markov cost-utility analysis of escitalopram and duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder,"OBJECTIVE: To estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life weeks of duloxetine and escitalopram. RESEARCH DESIGN: A probabilistic Markov cost-utility analysis with a time horizon of 1 year using data from placebo controlled randomized clinical trials for both products. METHODS: Efficacy was defined as remission of depressive symptoms and converted to utilities. Side effects were incorporated using rates from clinical trials and converted to utilities to define treatment effectiveness. The effectiveness outcome was quality adjusted life weeks (QALWs). Estimates of effectiveness (efficacy and side effects) used beta distributions and costs used gamma distributions. Using a managed care perspective, medication costs and physician office visits were included in the model, along with costs associated with treatment failure. Antidepressant costs were obtained using average wholesale price minus 20%. Physician visit costs were obtained from the 2006 US Medicare fee schedule for physician services. A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted using 1000 trials with both first- and second-order sampling. RESULTS: Over 1 year, the estimated mean quality-adjusted life weeks was 41.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.7-41.3) for escitalopram and 38.2 (95% CI: 37.9-38.4) for duloxetine. The mean annual total medical cost for escitalopram was $907 (95% CI: $894-$919) and $1633 (95% CI: $1614-$1654) for duloxetine. Limitations to this analysis include using separate studies examining the efficacy and adverse events of either escitalopram or duloxetine, assuming the switch, augmentation, and titration rates for duloxetine to be similar to escitalopram, and using utility estimates from published literature for the antidepressant adverse events. CONCLUSION: This analysis suggests that escitalopram was more effective in terms of QALWs and less costly than duloxetine for treatment of depression.",2008-01-03947,18331669,Curr Med Res Opin,Edward P Armstrong,2008,24 / 4,1115-21,No,18331669,"Edward P Armstrong; Daniel C Malone; M Haim Erder; A Markov cost-utility analysis of escitalopram and duloxetine for the treatment of major depressive disorder, Curr Med Res Opin, 2008-Apr; 24(4):0300-7995; 1115-21",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Escitalopram vs. Duloxetine,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-13698.11,United States,2006,-17585.43

DESIGN: Computer-based, value-based medicine analysis. METHODS: Decision analyses were performed under two scenarios: ERM surgery in better-seeing eye and ERM surgery in worse-seeing eye. The models applied long-term published data primarily from the Blue Mountains Eye Study and the Beaver Dam Eye Study. Visual acuity and major complications were derived from 25-gauge pars plana vitrectomy studies. Patient-based, time trade-off utility values, Markov modeling, sensitivity analysis, and net present value adjustments were used in the design and calculation of results. Main outcome measures included the number of discounted quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) gained and dollars spent per QALY gained. RESULTS: ERM surgery in the better-seeing eye compared with observation resulted in a mean gain of 0.755 discounted QALYs (3% annual rate) per patient treated. This model resulted in $4,680 per QALY for this procedure. When sensitivity analysis was performed, utility values varied from $6,245 to $3,746/QALY gained, medical costs varied from $3,510 to $5,850/QALY gained, and ERM recurrence rate increased to $5,524/QALY. ERM surgery in the worse-seeing eye compared with observation resulted in a mean gain of 0.27 discounted QALYs per patient treated.

4990,CT Angiography is Cost-Effective for Confirmation of Internal Carotid Artery Occlusions,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE While sensitive to internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, carotid ultrasound can produce false-positive results. CT angiography (CTA) has a high specificity for ICA occlusion and is safer and cheaper than catheter angiography, although less accurate. We determined the cost-effectiveness of CTA versus catheter angiography for confirming an ICA occlusion first suggested by carotid ultrasound. METHODS A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of CTA compared with catheter angiography in a hypothetical cohort of symptomatic patients with a screening examination consistent with an ICA occlusion. Costs in 2004 dollars were estimated from Medicare reimbursement. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years. RESULTS The 2-year cost in the CTA scenario was $9,178, and for catheter angiography, $11,531, consistent with a $2,353 cost-savings per person for CTA. CTA resulted in accrual of 1.83 quality-adjusted life years while catheter angiography resulted in 1.82 quality-adjusted life years. CTA was less costly and marginally more effective than catheter angiography. In sensitivity analyses, when CTA sensitivity and specificity were allowed to vary across a plausible range, CTA remained cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS After screening examination has suggested an ICA occlusion, confirmatory testing with CTA provides similar effectiveness to catheter angiography and is less costly.",2008-01-03956,18321251,J Neuroimaging,Devin L Brown,2008,/,,No,18321251,"Devin L Brown; Stuart N Hoffman; Teresa L Jacobs; Kirsten L Gruis; Susan L Johnson; Michael E Chernew; Stuart N Hoffman; Teresa L Jacobs; Kirsten L Gruis; Susan L Johnson; Michael E Chernew; CT Angiography is Cost-Effective for Confirmation of Internal Carotid Artery Occlusions, J Neuroimaging, 2008-Jan-07; ():1051-2284",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,CT angiography (CTA) vs. Catheter angiography,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,Not Stated,Not Stated,-235300,United States,2004,-322383.42

METHODS: An empirically calibrated model was used to assess the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (2004 US dollars per QALY) of screening, vaccination of preadolescent girls, and vaccination combined with screening. Screening varied by initiation age (18, 21, or 25 years), interval (every 1, 2, 3, or 5 years), and test (HPV DNA testing of cervical specimens or cytologic evaluation of cervical cells with a Pap test). Testing strategies included: 1) cytology followed by HPV DNA testing for equivocal cytologic results (cytology with HPV test triage); 2) HPV DNA testing followed by cytology for positive HPV DNA results (HPV test with cytology triage); and 3) combined HPV DNA testing and cytology. Strategies were permitted to switch once at age 25, 30, or 35 years. RESULTS: For unvaccinated women, triennial cytology with HPV test triage, beginning by age 21 years and switching to HPV testing with cytology triage at age 30 years, cost $78,000 per QALY compared with the next best strategy.

PARTICIPANTS: 699 patients aged 18-65 who presented to their general practitioner with epigastric pain, heartburn, or both without ""alarm symptoms"" for malignancy. INTERVENTION: H pylori 13C urea breath test plus one week of eradication treatment if positive or proton pump inhibitor alone; subsequent management at general practitioner's discretion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost effectiveness in cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) (EQ-5D) and effect on dyspeptic symptoms at one year measured with short form Leeds dyspepsia questionnaire. RESULTS: 343 patients were randomised to testing for H pylori, and 100 were positive. The successful eradication rate was 78%. 356 patients received proton pump inhibitor for 28 days. At 12 months no significant differences existed between the two groups in QALYs, costs, or dyspeptic symptoms. Minor reductions in costly resource use over the year in the test and treat group ""paid back"" the initial cost of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Test and treat and acid suppression are equally cost effective in the initial management of dyspepsia. Empirical acid suppression is an appropriate initial strategy. As costs are similar overall, general practitioners should discuss with patients at which point to consider H pylori testing.

4997,Economic impact of extended treatment with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin for slow hepatitis C virologic responders,"It is difficult to achieve a sustained virologic response from antiviral therapy for genotype 1 hepatitis C virus-infected patients without a sufficient virologic response in the early weeks after treatment. However, a recent study has reported on the effectiveness of an extended course of treatment with peginterferon alpha-2a plus ribavirin for slow virologic responders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the economic impact of an extended course of treatment. A Markov cohort model of hepatitis C was designed in order to demonstrate the clinical states, based on the assigned transition probabilities over 30 years. The slow virologic responders treated with an extended 72-week course of therapy could increase by 0.55 the quality-adjusted life years (=15.35-14.80) and reduce the lifetime cost by $2762 (=71 559-69 438) in comparison with those treated by the standard 48-week course.

4999,Could CT screening for lung cancer ever be cost effective in the United Kingdom?,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The absence of trial evidence makes it impossible to determine whether or not mass screening for lung cancer would be cost effective and, indeed, whether a clinical trial to investigate the problem would be justified. Attempts have been made to resolve this issue by modelling, although the complex models developed to date have required more real-world data than are currently available. Being founded on unsubstantiated assumptions, they have produced estimates with wide confidence intervals and of uncertain relevance to the United Kingdom. METHOD: I develop a simple, deterministic, model of a screening regimen potentially applicable to the UK. The model includes only a limited number of parameters, for the majority of which, values have already been established in non-trial settings. The component costs of screening are derived from government guidance and from published audits, whilst the values for test parameters are derived from clinical studies. The expected health gains as a result of screening are calculated by combining published survival data for screened and unscreened cohorts with data from Life Tables. When a degree of uncertainty over a parameter value exists, I use a conservative estimate, i.e. one likely to make screening appear less, rather than more, cost effective. RESULTS: The incremental cost effectiveness ratio of a single screen amongst a high-risk male population is calculated to be around pound14,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. The average cost of this screening regimen per person screened is around pound200. It is possible that, when obtained experimentally in any future trial, parameter values will be found to differ from those previously obtained in non-trial settings. On the basis both of differing assumptions about evaluation conventions and of reasoned speculations as to how test parameters and costs might behave under screening, the model generates cost effectiveness ratios as high as around pound20,000 and as low as around pound7,000. CONCLUSION: It is evident that eventually being able to identify a cost effective regimen of CT screening for lung cancer in the UK is by no means an unreasonable expectation.",2008-01-03972,18302756,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,David K Whynes,2008,6 /,5,Yes,18302756,"David K Whynes; Could CT screening for lung cancer ever be cost effective in the United Kingdom?, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2008; 6():1478-7547; 5",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"CT screening for lung cancer vs. Usual care, no CT screening",Not Stated,Not Stated,61 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,13910,United Kingdom,2006,32917.83
5000,Comparative clinical and economic outcomes of treatments for refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),"BACKGROUND: Various drug therapies are available for treatment of refractory stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their comparative economic value is unclear. METHODS: We developed a decision analytic model to evaluate the incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of erlotinib, docetaxel, or pemetrexed in a cohort of refractory advanced stage NSCLC patients 60 years of age from a US payer perspective. Mean progression-free and overall survival were assumed equal for the three treatments based on published clinical trials, from which adverse event rates were also derived. Costs and utilities were obtained from publicly available sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate uncertainty in the results. RESULTS: Treatment with erlotinib, docetaxel, and pemetrexed yielded 0.42, 0.41, and 0.41 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), respectively. The slightly increased QALYs for erlotinib compared to docetaxel and pemetrexed resulted from less severe treatment complications and oral vs. IV administration. Total costs were US$ 37,000, US$ 39,100 and US$ 43,800 for erlotinib, docetaxel and pemetrexed, respectively. In the probabilistic sensitivity analyses, erlotinib was cost-saving in 65 and 87% of the simulations compared to docetaxel and pemetrexed, respectively, and had improved QALYs and decreased costs or was cost-effective in 42 and 55% of simulations. Estimates of treatment duration were among the most influential parameters in the analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our analysis suggest treatment of refractory NSCLC with erlotinib is less costly compared with alternative treatments, and suggested improvements in QALYs should be confirmed in controlled clinical trials.",2008-01-03979,18295368,Lung Cancer,Josh J Carlson,2008,61 / 3,405-15,No,18295368,"Josh J Carlson; Carolina Reyes; Nina Oestreicher; Deborah Lubeck; Scott D Ramsey; David L Veenstra; Carolina Reyes; Nina Oestreicher; Deborah Lubeck; Scott D Ramsey; David L Veenstra; Comparative clinical and economic outcomes of treatments for refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Lung Cancer, 2008-Sep; 61(3):0169-5002; 405-15",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Erlotinib vs. Docetaxel,Not Stated,60 Years,60 Years,"Female, Male",Full,2 Years,3.00,3.00,-212700,United States,2007,-265499.03
