8001,Cost-Effectiveness of Combination Nonbiologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug Strategies in Patients with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the costs and benefits of alternative combination strategies of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) and DMARD monotherapy in patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Data were drawn from randomized controlled trials that compared DMARD monotherapy or any DMARD combination strategy, with or without combined steroid therapy. Mixed treatment comparison methods were used to estimate the relative effectiveness of the different strategies. A mathematical model was developed to compare the longterm costs and benefits of the alternative strategies, combining data from a variety of sources. Costs were considered from a health sector viewpoint and benefits were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). RESULTS: If decision makers use a threshold of £20,000 (US$29,000) per QALY, then the strategies most likely to be cost-effective are either DMARD combination therapy with downward titration (probability of being optimal = 0.50) or intensive, triple DMARD combination therapy (probability of being optimal = 0.43). The intensive DMARD strategy generated an additional cost of £27,392 per additional QALY gained compared to the downward titration strategy. Other combination strategies were unlikely to be considered cost-effective compared to DMARD monotherapy. Results were robust to a range of scenario sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Combination DMARD therapy is likely to be cost-effective compared to DMARD monotherapy where treatment entails rapid downward dose titration or intensive, triple DMARD therapy.",2011-01-07648,21572149,J Rheumatol,Jonathan C Tosh,2011,/,,No,21572149,"Jonathan C Tosh; Allan J Wailoo; David L Scott; Chris M Deighton; Cost-Effectiveness of Combination Nonbiologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drug Strategies in Patients with Early Rheumatoid Arthritis, J Rheumatol, 2011-May-15; ():0315-162X",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Parallel combination: Two or more DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) given in combination vs. DMARD (disease-modifying antirheumatic drug) monotherapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,1356,United Kingdom,2008,3022.84

8009,Pharmacoeconomic analysis of consolidation therapy with pemetrexed after first-line chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer,"Prolongation of progression-free survival and overall survival have been reported with consolidation therapy after first-line chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer, but only a few pharmacoeconomic analyses have been performed. We performed a pharmacoeconomic analysis to assess the cost-effectiveness of consolidation therapy with pemetrexed compared with non-consolidation therapy. We developed a Markov model to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of consolidation therapy with pemetrexed compared with non-consolidation therapy based on previous reports. We analyzed all histology groups together, and individually analyzed non-squamous cell carcinoma, in which pemetrexed has been shown to be more effective, and squamous cell carcinoma, in which pemetrexed has been shown to be less effective. We conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the uncertainty for our analysis model and the willingness to pay using thresholds. The ICER for consolidation therapy with pemetrexed was about US$ 109,024/life years gained (LYG) (JPY 12.5 million/LYG) and US$ 203,022/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) (JPY 23.3 million/QALY) for all histology. For non-squamous cell carcinoma, respective values were US$ 80,563/LYG (JPY 9.3 million/LYG) and US$ 150,115/QALY (JPY 17.3 million/QALY). Both % of probability at a threshold of JPY 5.0 million (US$ 43,478) for all histology and non-squamous cell carcinoma were less than 0.1%.

8013,Incremental cost-utility analysis of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty compared with penetrating keratoplasty for the treatment of keratoconus,"Purpose: This study sought to determine the cost effectiveness of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) compared with penetrating keratoplasty (PK) for the treatment of keratoconus. DALK is associated with lower rates of postoperative complications compared with PK, but is a more expensive procedure; whether it is cost effective compared with PK is unknown. Design: The study was an incremental cost-utility analysis from a health systems perspective using retrospective data on a cohort of patients with severe keratoconus. Methods: The analysis was conducted using 1-year cost and outcomes data from 148 keratoconus patients, representing 102 PK and 46 DALK cases, seen for corneal grafts between January 1991 and January 2009 at the Singapore National Eye Center. The main outcome assessed was the incremental cost-utility ratios associated with PK and DALK for the treatment of keratoconus. Results: Over a 20-year period, PK was the lower cost procedure and had an incremental cost-utility ratio of $3,750 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with no surgical treatment. Compared with PK, DALK has an incremental quality-adjusted life-year gain of 0.8 and an incremental cost of $2,420, for an incremental cost-utility ratio of $3,025 per quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusions: Compared with PK, DALK has a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio and, resources permitting, should be considered as a first-line treatment for keratoconus. Additional studies are needed to confirm the expected advantages of DALK over PK when it comes to long-term graft failure rates.",2011-01-07650,21570048,Am J Ophthalmol,Timothy S Koo,2011,152 / 1,40-47.e2,No,21570048,"Timothy S Koo; Eric Finkelstein; Donald Tan; Jodhbir S Mehta; Incremental cost-utility analysis of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty compared with penetrating keratoplasty for the treatment of keratoconus, Am J Ophthalmol, 2011-Jul; 152(1):0002-9394; 40-47.e2",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Penetrating keratoplasty vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,Not Stated,3.00,3750,Singapore,2009,3114.03

Methods: The analysis was conducted using 1-year cost and outcomes data from 148 keratoconus patients, representing 102 PK and 46 DALK cases, seen for corneal grafts between January 1991 and January 2009 at the Singapore National Eye Center. The main outcome assessed was the incremental cost-utility ratios associated with PK and DALK for the treatment of keratoconus. Results: Over a 20-year period, PK was the lower cost procedure and had an incremental cost-utility ratio of $3,750 per quality-adjusted life-year compared with no surgical treatment. Compared with PK, DALK has an incremental quality-adjusted life-year gain of 0.8 and an incremental cost of $2,420, for an incremental cost-utility ratio of $3,025 per quality-adjusted life-year. Conclusions: Compared with PK, DALK has a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio and, resources permitting, should be considered as a first-line treatment for keratoconus. Additional studies are needed to confirm the expected advantages of DALK over PK when it comes to long-term graft failure rates.",2011-01-07650,21570048,Am J Ophthalmol,Timothy S Koo,2011,152 / 1,40-47.e2,No,21570048,"Timothy S Koo; Eric Finkelstein; Donald Tan; Jodhbir S Mehta; Incremental cost-utility analysis of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty compared with penetrating keratoplasty for the treatment of keratoconus, Am J Ophthalmol, 2011-Jul; 152(1):0002-9394; 40-47.e2",QALY,Singapore,Not Stated,Not Stated,Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty vs. Penetrating Keratoplasty,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,20 Years,Not Stated,3.00,3025,Singapore,2009,2511.98
8015,Cost-effectiveness of point-of-care biomarker assessment for suspected myocardial infarction: the randomized assessment of treatment using panel Assay of cardiac markers (RATPAC) trial,"Objectives: Chest pain due to suspected myocardial infarction (MI) is responsible for many hospital admissions and consumes substantial health care resources. The Randomized Assessment of Treatment using Panel Assay of Cardiac markers (RATPAC) trial showed that diagnostic assessment using a point-of-care (POC) cardiac biomarker panel consisting of CK-MB, myoglobin, and troponin increased the proportion of patients successfully discharged after emergency department (ED) assessment. In this economic analysis, the authors aimed to determine whether POC biomarker panel assessment reduced health care costs and was likely to be cost-effective. Methods: The RATPAC trial was a multicenter individual patient randomized controlled trial comparing diagnostic assessment using a POC biomarker panel (CK-MB, myoglobin, and troponin, measured at baseline and 90 minutes) to standard care without the POC panel in patients attending six EDs with acute chest pain due to suspected MI (n = 2,243). Individual patient resource use data were collected from all participants up to 3 months after hospital attendance using self-completed questionnaires at 1 and 3 months and case note review. ED staff and POC testing costs were estimated through a microcosting study of 246 participants. Resource use was valued using national unit costs. Health utility was measured using the EQ-5D self-completed questionnaire, mailed at 1 and 3 months. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated by the trapezium rule using the EQ-5D tariff values at all follow-up points. Mean costs per patient were compared between the two treatment groups. Cost-effectiveness was estimated in terms of probability of dominance and incremental cost per QALY. Results: Point-of-care panel assessment was associated with higher ED costs, coronary care costs, and cardiac intervention costs, but lower general inpatient costs. Mean costs per patient were £1217.14 (standard deviation [SD] ± 3164.93), or $1,987.14 (SD ±$4,939.25), with POC versus £1005.91 (SD ±£1907.55), or $1,568.64 (SD ±$2,975.78), with standard care (p = 0.056). Mean QALYs were 0.158 (SD ± 0.052) versus 0.161 (SD ± 0.056; p = 0.250). The probability of standard care being dominant (i.e., cheaper and more effective) was 0.888, while the probability of the POC panel being dominant was 0.004. These probabilities were not markedly altered by sensitivity analysis varying the costs of the POC panel and excluding intensive care costs. Conclusions: Point-of-care panel assessment does not reduce costs despite reducing admissions and may even increase costs. It is unlikely to be considered a cost-effective use of health care resources.",2011-01-07657,21569168,Acad Emerg Med,Patrick Fitzgerald,2011,18 / 5,488-95,No,21569168,"Patrick Fitzgerald; Steve W Goodacre; Elizabeth Cross; Simon Dixon; Cost-effectiveness of point-of-care biomarker assessment for suspected myocardial infarction: the randomized assessment of treatment using panel Assay of cardiac markers (RATPAC) trial, Acad Emerg Med, 2011-May; 18(5):1069-6563; 488-95",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Point-of-care biomarker panel consisting of creatine kinase-MB, myoglobin, and troponin vs. Standard diagnostic assessment: troponin assays",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,3 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-70410,United Kingdom,2008,-156960.07

Coronary computed tomographic angiography (CTA) may allow earlier discharge of low-risk patients, resulting in cost savings. We modeled clinical and economic outcomes of diagnostic strategies in patients with chest pain and at low risk of CAD: exercise electrocardiography (ECG), stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), stress echocardiography, and a CTA strategy comprising an initial CTA scan with confirmatory SPECT for indeterminate results. Our results suggest that a 2-step diagnostic strategy of CTA with SPECT for intermediate scans is likely to be less costly and more effective for the diagnosis of a patient group at low risk of CAD and a prevalence of 2% to 30%. The CTA strategies were cost saving (lower costs, higher quality-adjusted life-years) compared with stress ECG, echocardiography, and SPECT.

8020,Cost-utility of exenatide once weekly compared with insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK,"Objective: To compare the cost-utility of exenatide once weekly (EQW) and insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes in the United Kingdom (UK). Research design and methods: The IMS CORE Diabetes Model was used to project clinical and economic outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes treated with EQW or insulin glargine. Treatment effects and patient baseline characteristics (mean age: 58 years, mean glycohaemoglobin: 8.3%) were taken from the DURATION-3 study. Unit costs and health state utility values were derived from published sources. As the price of EQW is not yet known, the prices of two currently available glucagon-like peptide-1 products were used as benchmarks. To reflect diabetes progression, patients started on EQW switched to insulin glargine after 5 years. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the UK National Health Service over a time horizon of 50 years with costs and outcomes discounted at 3.5%. Sensitivity analyses explored the impact of changes in input data and assumptions and investigated the cost utility of EQW in specific body mass index (BMI) subgroups. Main outcome measures: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for EQW compared with insulin glargine. Results: At a price equivalent to liraglutide 1.2 mg, EQW was more effective and more costly than insulin glargine, with a base case ICER of £10,597 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. EQW was associated with an increased time to development of any diabetes-related complication of 0.21 years, compared with insulin glargine. Three BMI subgroups investigated (<30, 30-35 and >35 kg/m(2)) reported ICERs for EQW compared with insulin glargine ranging from £9425 to £12,956 per QALY gained. Conclusions: At the prices investigated, the cost per QALY gained for EQW when compared with insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes in the UK setting, was within the range normally considered cost effective by NICE. Cost effectiveness in practice will depend on the final price of EQW and the extent to which benefits observed in short-term randomised trials are replicated in long-term use.",2011-01-07662,21563878,J Med Econ,Am?lie Beaudet,2011,14 / 3,357-66,Yes,21563878,"Am?lie Beaudet; James L Palmer; Louise Timlin; Bernard Wilson; David Bruhn; Kristina S Boye; Adam Lloyd; Cost-utility of exenatide once weekly compared with insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes in the UK, J Med Econ, 2011; 14(3):1369-6998; 357-66",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Exenatide once weekly vs. Insulin glargine,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,10597,United Kingdom,2009,18510.17

Objective: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening using the tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs). Methods: A Markov model of screening for LTBI with TST and IGRA in risk-groups considered in current LTBI screening guidelines. Measurements and Main Results: In all risk-groups, TST and IGRA screening resulted in increased mean life expectancy, ranging from 0.03 - 0.24 life-months/person screened. IGRA screening resulted in greater life expectancy gains than TST. Screening always cost more than not screening, but IGRA was cost-saving compared to TST in some groups.

IGRA screening resulted in greater life expectancy gains than TST. Screening always cost more than not screening, but IGRA was cost-saving compared to TST in some groups. Four patterns of cost-effectiveness emerged, related to four risk categories: 1) Individuals at highest risk of TB reactivation (close contacts and HIV-infected) - the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IGRA compared to TST was <$100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. 2) The foreign-born - IGRA was cost-saving compared to TST and cost-effective compared to no screening (ICER <$100,000/ QALY gained). 3) Vulnerable populations (homeless, drug user, former prisoner) - the ICER of TST screening was approximately $100,000-$150,000/QALY gained, but IGRA was not cost-effective. 4) Medical co-morbidities (diabetes and others) - the ICER of screening with TST or IGRA was >$100,000/QALY.

Four patterns of cost-effectiveness emerged, related to four risk categories: 1) Individuals at highest risk of TB reactivation (close contacts and HIV-infected) - the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IGRA compared to TST was <$100,000/quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. 2) The foreign-born - IGRA was cost-saving compared to TST and cost-effective compared to no screening (ICER <$100,000/ QALY gained). 3) Vulnerable populations (homeless, drug user, former prisoner) - the ICER of TST screening was approximately $100,000-$150,000/QALY gained, but IGRA was not cost-effective. 4) Medical co-morbidities (diabetes and others) - the ICER of screening with TST or IGRA was >$100,000/QALY.

Measurements: Incremental health gain in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) generated by each drug compared to 'no intervention'. Findings: Bupropion resulted in an incremental QALY increase of 0.07 with a concurrent cost saving of £68; NRT and varenicline both caused incremental QALYs increases of 0.04 at costs of £12 and £90 respectively, though varenicline findings were based on data from a single clinical trial and require cautious interpretation. Even after extensive sensitivity analyses with substantial varying of key model parameters, cost-effectiveness of all drugs remained.

8062,Clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of lanthanum carbonate as second-line therapy in hemodialysis patients in Japan,"SummaryBackground and objectives Lanthanum carbonate (LC) is a nonaluminum, noncalcium phosphate binder that is effective for hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients. However, its efficacy and cost-effectiveness as second-line therapy have not been fully examined. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We first conducted a multicenter, open-label, 16-week clinical trial to examine the effect of additive LC in 116 hemodialysis patients who had uncontrolled hyperphosphatemia with conventional phosphorus-lowering therapy alone. Based on these clinical data, a state transition model was developed to evaluate the benefits and costs associated with LC as second-line therapy. Reduced risks for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among patients treated with LC arise through more of the population achieving the target phosphorus levels. Uncertainty was explored through sensitivity analysis. Results After 16 weeks of additive LC treatment, mean serum phosphorus levels decreased from 7.30 ± 0.90 to 5.71 ± 1.32 mg/dl, without significant changes in serum calcium or intact parathyroid hormone levels. A subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis showed that compared with conventional treatment, additive LC incurred an average additional lifetime cost of $22,054 per person and conferred an additional 0.632 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $34,896 per QALY gained.

8063,"Economic modeling of the combined effects of HIV-disease, cholesterol and lipoatrophy based on ACTG 5142 trial data","Background: This study examines the cost and consequences of initiating an ARV regimen including Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or Efavirenz (EFV), using data from a recent clinical trial in a previously published model of HIV-disease. Methods: We populated the Markov model of HIV-disease with data from ACTG 5142 study to estimate the economic outcomes of starting ARV therapy with a PI-containing regimen as compared to an NNRTI-containing regimen, given their virologic and immunologic efficacy and effects on cholesterol and lipoatrophy. CNS toxicities and GI tolerability were not included in the model because of their transient nature or low cost remedies, and therefore lack of economic impact. CD4+ T-cell counts and the HIV-1 RNA (viral load) values from the study were used to assign a specific health state (HS) to each patient for each quarter year. The resulting frequencies used as ""raw"" data directly into the model obviate the reliance on statistical tests, and allow the model to reflect actual patient behavior in the clinical trial. An HS just below the last observed HS was used to replace a missing value. Results: The modeled estimates (undiscounted) for the LPV/r-based regimen resulted in 1.41 quality-adjusted life months (QALMs) gained over a lifetime compared to the EFV-based regimen. The LPV/r-based regimen incurred $7,458 (1.8%) greater cost over a lifetime due to differences in drug costs and survival. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio using the discounted cost and QALYs was $88,829/QALY. Most of the higher costs accrue before the 7th year of treatment and were offset by subsequent savings. The estimates are highly sensitive to the effect of lipoatrophy on Health-related Quality of Life (HRQOL), but not to the effect of cholesterol levels. Conclusions: The cost effectiveness of ARV regimens may be strongly affected by enduring AEs, such as lipoatrophy. It is important to consider specific AE effects from all drugs in a regimen when ARVs are compared.",2011-01-07677,21548986,Cost Eff Resour Alloc,Kit N Simpson,2011,9 /,5,Yes,21548986,"Kit N Simpson; Birgitta Dietz; Robert W Baran; Kevin W Garren; Sharon A Riddler; Menaka Bhor; Richard H Haubrich; Economic modeling of the combined effects of HIV-disease, cholesterol and lipoatrophy based on ACTG 5142 trial data, Cost Eff Resour Alloc, 2011; 9():1478-7547; 5",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) vs. Efavirenz (EFV),Not Stated,Not Stated,13 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,88829,United States,2007,110879.23

Current guidelines suggest screening populations with a prevalence of ≥2%. Our objective was to determine whether this screening threshold is cost-effective and whether screening lower-prevalence populations might also be cost-effective. Methods: We developed a Markov state transition model to examine screening of asymptomatic outpatients in the United States. The base case was a 35-year-old man living in a region with an HBV infection prevalence of 2%. Interventions (versus no screening) included screening for Hepatitis B surface antigen followed by treatment of appropriate patients with (1) pegylated interferon-α2a for 48 weeks, (2) a low-cost nucleoside or nucleotide agent with a high rate of developing viral resistance for 48 weeks, (3) prolonged treatment with low-cost, high-resistance nucleoside or nucleotide, or (4) prolonged treatment with a high-cost nucleoside or nucleotide with a low rate of developing viral resistance. Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs in 2008 US dollars. Results: Screening followed by treatment with a low-cost, high-resistance nucleoside or nucleotide was cost-effective ($29,230 per QALY).

8074,"Updated cost-effectiveness analysis of trastuzumab for early breast cancer: a UK perspective considering duration of benefit, long-term toxicity and pattern of recurrence","Background: Trastuzumab has significantly improved survival outcomes for women with Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer. Trastuzumab was established as a cost-effective adjuvant treatment in 2006. We present an updated cost-effectiveness analysis from the UK perspective, which explores assumptions about the duration of benefit from treatment, pattern of metastatic recurrence and long-term cardiac toxicity. Objective: The objective of this study was to calculate, from the UK NHS perspective, expected costs (year 2008 values) and benefits over the lifetime of an average cohort of women with HER2-positive early breast cancer treated with or without 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab sequentially after chemotherapy. Methods: A cost-utility analysis was performed using a discrete-state time-dependent semi-Markov model. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was used to characterize uncertainty around expected outcomes. Value-of-information (VOI) analysis was used to identify areas of priority for further research. Results: The cost-effectiveness estimates were highly sensitive to the estimated duration of treatment benefit. Trastuzumab remained a cost-effective treatment strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of £30,000 per QALY provided the duration of benefit was more than 3.6 years from treatment initiation, assuming the hazard ratio for disease-free survival was 0.63. An increasing proportion of brain metastases with trastuzumab produced a small change towards worse cost effectiveness. Long-term cardiac toxicity needed to rise to high levels to affect overall life expectancy and cost effectiveness. VOI analysis placed highest value on research into the duration of treatment benefit. The relationships between progression-free survival and overall survival and the costs of cancer recurrence were also important. Conclusion: The cost effectiveness of adjuvant trastuzumab remains uncertain and dependent on assumptions regarding its clinical effect. Uncertainty around cost effectiveness could be reduced by further research into the duration of treatment effect, particularly in subgroups where this may be shorter. Long-term follow-up is warranted and methods to accurately measure duration of treatment effect and late toxicities should be developed for future adjuvant drug studies.",2011-01-07699,21504241,Pharmacoeconomics,Peter S Hall,2011,29 / 5,415-32,Yes,21504241,"Peter S Hall; Claire Hulme; Christopher McCabe; Yemi Oluboyede; Jeff Round; David A Cameron; Updated cost-effectiveness analysis of trastuzumab for early breast cancer: a UK perspective considering duration of benefit, long-term toxicity and pattern of recurrence, Pharmacoeconomics, 2011-May-01; 29(5):1179-2027; 415-32",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Trastuzumab vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,25803,United Kingdom,2008,57520.82
8075,Cost-effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in the Netherlands and Norway.,"The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men aged 65 years, for both the Netherlands and Norway.A Markov model was developed to simulate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years, net health benefits, lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for both screening and no screening for AAA. The best available evidence was retrieved from the literature and combined with primary data from the two countries separately, and analysed from a national perspective. A threshold willingness-to-pay (WTP) of ?20 000 and ?62 500 was used for data from the Netherlands and Norway respectively.The additional costs of the screening strategy compared with no screening were ?421 (95 per cent confidence interval 33 to 806) per person in the Netherlands, and the additional life-years were 0?097 (-0?180 to 0?365), representing ?4340 per life-year. For Norway, the values were ?562 (59 to 1078), 0?057 (-0?135 to 0?253) life-years and ?9860 per life-year respectively. In Norway the results were sensitive to a decrease in the prevalence of AAA in 65-year-old men to 1 per cent, or lower. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses indicated that AAA screening has a 70 per cent probability of being cost-effective in the Netherlands with a WTP threshold of ?20 000, and 70 per cent in Norway with a threshold of ?62 500.Using this model, screening for AAA in 65-year-old men would be highly cost-effective in both the Netherlands and Norway.

8076,Cost-effectiveness of screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm in the Netherlands and Norway.,"The aim of this study was to determine the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in men aged 65 years, for both the Netherlands and Norway.A Markov model was developed to simulate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life-years, net health benefits, lifetime costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for both screening and no screening for AAA. The best available evidence was retrieved from the literature and combined with primary data from the two countries separately, and analysed from a national perspective. A threshold willingness-to-pay (WTP) of ?20 000 and ?62 500 was used for data from the Netherlands and Norway respectively.The additional costs of the screening strategy compared with no screening were ?421 (95 per cent confidence interval 33 to 806) per person in the Netherlands, and the additional life-years were 0?097 (-0?180 to 0?365), representing ?4340 per life-year. For Norway, the values were ?562 (59 to 1078), 0?057 (-0?135 to 0?253) life-years and ?9860 per life-year respectively. In Norway the results were sensitive to a decrease in the prevalence of AAA in 65-year-old men to 1 per cent, or lower.

8077,Cost of a quality-adjusted life year in liver transplantation: The influence of indication and MELD score.,"Cost issues in liver transplantation (LT) have received increasing attention, but cost-utility is rarely calculated. We compared costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) from the time of placement on the LT waiting-list to 1 year post-transplant for 252 LT patients, and up to 5 years post-transplant for 81 patients. We performed separate calculations for chronic liver disease (CLD), acute liver failure (ALF), and different scores from the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD). Health-related quality of life, to estimate QALYs, was measured with the 15D instrument. Respective median costs and QALYs after LT were ?141768 and 0.90 for 1 year and ?177618 and 3.96 for 5 years. The first year comprised 80% of the 5-year costs. The main cost during years 2-5 was immunosuppression drugs (59% of annual costs). The cost/QALY ratio improved from ?158400/QALY at 1 year to ?44854/QALY at 5 years, being more beneficial in CLD (?42500/QALY) compared to ALF (?63957/QALY) and in low-MELD compared to high-MELD groups. Although patients with CLD and MELD scores <25 demonstrated markedly higher 5-year costs (?228434) than those with MELD <15 (?169541), the difference in cost/QALY was less pronounced (?59894/QALY vs. ?41769/QALY, respectively).

8085,A pharmacoeconomic analysis of sertindole in the treatment of schizophrenia in Sweden.,"Background: Atypical antipsychotics have similar clinical efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia; variability in their tolerability represents the discerning factor in treatment choices. Sertindole has a relatively good tolerability profile that favours long-term patient adherence and, therefore, is associated with lower rates of relapse and rehospitalization. Aim: A model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of a 5-year treatment strategy starting with sertindole versus olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole or the typical antipsychotic agent, haloperidol. Methods: The model was based on published trials and local clinical practice, and considered costs from the perspective of the Swedish National Health Insurance Board. Results: All atypical agents were clinically superior and more cost-effective than haloperidol with a cost per quality-adjusted life year gained of approximately 490,000 Swedish kroner. Sertindole was associated with the lowest direct and indirect medical costs, driven by its tolerability profile. Conclusions: Sertindole represents a useful alternative to the current treatment options available in Sweden.

8089,Cost-effectiveness of modern radiotherapy techniques in locally advanced pancreatic cancer.,"BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy may improve the outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer but at an increased cost. In this study, the authors evaluated the cost-effectiveness of modern radiotherapy techniques in the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 treatment regimens: gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus conventional radiotherapy, gemcitabine plus intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT); and gemcitabine with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). Patients transitioned between the following 5 health states: stable disease, local progression, distant failure, local and distant failure, and death. Health utility tolls were assessed for radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments and for radiation toxicity. RESULTS: SBRT increased life expectancy by 0.20 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an increased cost of $13,700 compared with gemcitabine alone (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = $69,500 per QALY). SBRT was more effective and less costly than conventional radiotherapy and IMRT. An analysis that excluded SBRT demonstrated that conventional radiotherapy had an ICER of $126,800 per QALY compared with gemcitabine alone, and IMRT had an ICER of $1,584,100 per QALY compared with conventional radiotherapy. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the probability of cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY was 78% for gemcitabine alone, 21% for SBRT, 1.4% for conventional radiotherapy, and 0.01% for IMRT. At a willingness to pay of $200,000 per QALY, the probability of cost-effectiveness was 73% for SBRT, 20% for conventional radiotherapy, 7% for gemcitabine alone, and 0.7% for IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that IMRT in locally advanced pancreatic cancer exceeds what society considers cost-effective. In contrast, combining gemcitabine with SBRT increased clinical effectiveness beyond that of gemcitabine alone at a cost potentially acceptable by today's standards.

8098,Cost-effectiveness analysis of a universal rotavirus immunization program in Japan.,"In anticipation of the imminent licensure of rotavirus vaccine, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus vaccine in Japan by taking into account the considerable variations in the incidence of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations previously reported in the literature. We assumed that the variation was due to local differences in healthcare utilization practices rather than a true difference in the incidence of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. Thus, a Markov model was constructed such that the sum of rotavirus-associated hospitalizations and outpatient visits was set a constant value of 129 cases per 1,000 child-years. We calculated the direct medical cost, the indirect cost, and the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss in children aged less than 5 years. For the base case scenario, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY gained was 9.8 million Japanese yen from the healthcare perspective, but it was 900,000 Japanese yen from the societal perspective, making the program of universal immunization against rotavirus highly cost-effective. Furthermore, the universal immunization program was found to be cost-effective from the societal perspective for any of the previously reported incidence rates of rotavirus-associated hospitalization.

8100,Strategies for the Prevention of Postoperative Recurrence in Crohn's Disease: Results of a Decision Analysis.,"OBJECTIVES:Nearly 70% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) undergo surgical resection, with one-quarter subsequently developing clinical recurrence within 12 months. Several options exist for the prevention of postoperative recurrence in CD, but the comparative cost effectiveness of these competing strategies has not been previously analyzed.METHODS:We developed a decision analytic model comprising five strategies-No Treatment, azathioprine (AZA), antibiotics (ABX), upfront infliximab (IFX), and tailored IFX that consisted of no upfront therapy with initiation of IFX in patients with severe endoscopic recurrence at 6 months. The base-case 1-year clinical recurrence rate was 24% with reduction in recurrence by 41%, 77%, and 99% for AZA, ABX, and IFX, respectively. A 1-year time horizon was used and sensitivity analyses were performed.RESULTS:At the base-case analysis, the ABX (0.82 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) and AZA (0.81 QALYs) arms were more effective and less expensive than the No Treatment strategy (0.80 QALYs). The most effective strategy was upfront IFX (0.83 QALYs); however, this was also the most expensive and resulted in a high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ($777,732/QALY) compared with no treatment. The tailored IFX arm was less effective than upfront use but had a more acceptable ICER. On increasing the recurrence rate to 78% (high-risk patients), upfront IFX resulted in 0.07 QALYs (ICER $130,580/QALY) gained compared with No Treatment, whereas ABX, AZA, and tailored IFX arms dominated No Treatment.CONCLUSION:Antibiotics are the most cost-effective option for preventing postoperative recurrence, but they have been associated with high rates of intolerance precluding widespread use. Upfront IFX is the most efficacious strategy but is not cost effective even in high-risk patients. Reserving IFX use for high-risk patients with early endoscopic recurrence is more cost effective than upfront use in all patients.Am J Gastroenterol advance online publication, 26 July 2011; doi:10.1038/ajg.2011.237.",2011-01-07735,21788991,Am J Gastroenterol,Ashwin N Ananthakrishnan,2011,/,,No,21788991,"Ashwin N Ananthakrishnan; Chin Hur; Pascal Juillerat; Joshua R Korzenik; Strategies for the Prevention of Postoperative Recurrence in Crohn's Disease: Results of a Decision Analysis., Am J Gastroenterol, ; ():0002-9270",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Azathioprine (AZA) vs. Antibiotics (ABX),Not Stated,35 Years,35 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-54782.61,United States,2010,-65021.56
