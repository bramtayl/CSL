33001,Cost-Effectiveness of Open Versus Endoscopic Carpal Tunnel Release,"BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common upper-extremity nerve compression syndrome. Over 500,000 carpal tunnel release (CTR) procedures are performed in the U.S. yearly. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic CTR (ECTR) versus open CTR (OCTR) using data from published meta-analyses comparing outcomes for ECTR and OCTR. METHODS: We developed a Markov model to examine the cost-effectiveness of OCTR versus ECTR for patients undergoing unilateral CTR in an office setting under local anesthesia and in an operating-room (OR) setting under monitored anesthesia care. The main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). We modeled societal (modeled with a 50-year-old patient) and Medicare payer (modeled with a 65-year-old patient) perspectives, adopting a lifetime time horizon. We performed deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs). RESULTS: ECTR resulted in 0.00141 additional QALY compared with OCTR. From a societal perspective, assuming 8.21 fewer days of work missed after ECTR than after OCTR, ECTR cost less across all procedure settings. The results are sensitive to the number of days of work missed following surgery. From a payer perspective, ECTR in the OR (ECTROR) cost $1,872 more than OCTR in the office (OCTRoffice), for an ICER of approximately $1,332,000/QALY. The ECTROR cost $654 more than the OCTROR, for an ICER of $464,000/QALY. The ECTRoffice cost $107 more than the OCTRoffice, for an ICER of $76,000/QALY. From a payer perspective, for a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY, OCTRoffice was preferred over ECTROR in 77% of the PSA iterations. From a societal perspective, ECTROR was preferred over OCTRoffice in 61% of the PSA iterations. CONCLUSIONS: From a societal perspective, ECTR is associated with lower costs as a result of an earlier return to work and leads to higher QALYs. Additional research on return to work is needed to confirm these findings on the basis of contemporary return-to-work practices. From a payer perspective, ECTR is more expensive and is cost-effective only if performed in an office setting under local anesthesia. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Economic and Decision Analysis Level I.

33005,Cost-utility of an eHealth application 'Oncokompas' that supports cancer survivors in self-management: results of a randomised controlled trial,"PURPOSE: The eHealth self-management application ''Oncokompas'' was developed to support cancer survivors in monitoring health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and symptoms, and obtaining personalized feedback and options for supportive care. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-utility of Oncokompas compared with care as usual (CAU) among cancer survivors. METHODS: Survivors were randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Direct (non-)medical, indirect non-medical costs, and HRQOL were measured at 3- and 6-month follow-up, using iMTA Medical Consumption and Productivity Costs and the EuroQol-5D questionnaires. Mean cumulative costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were compared between both groups. RESULTS: In total, 625 survivors were randomized into intervention (n?=?320) or control group (n?=?305). Base case analysis showed that incremental costs from a societal perspective were -?€163 (95% CI, -?665 to 326), and incremental QALYs were 0.0017 (95% CI, -?0.0121 to 0.0155) in the intervention group compared with those in the control group. The probability that, compared with CAU, Oncokompas is more effective was 60%, less costly 73%, and both more effective and less costly 47%. Sensitivity analyses showed that incremental costs vary between -?€40 and €69, and incremental QALYs vary between -?0.0023 and -?0.0057. CONCLUSION: Oncokompas is likely to be equally effective on utilities, and not more expensive than CAU, and will therefore contribute to sustainable cancer survivorship care in a (cost-)effective manner. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Oncokompas seems to improve HRQOL and reduces the burden of several tumour-specific symptoms, while costs from a societal perspective are similar to CAU.",2021-01-34565,32656739,J Cancer Surviv,A van der Hout,2021,15 / 1,77-86,No,32656739,"A van der Hout; F Jansen; C F van Uden-Kraan; V M Coupé; K Holtmaat; G A Nieuwenhuijzen; J A Hardillo; R J Baatenburg de Jong; N L Tiren-Verbeet; D W Sommeijer; K de Heer; C G Schaar; R J E Sedee; K Bosscha; M W M van den Brekel; J F Petersen; M Westerman; J Honings; R P Takes; I Houtenbos; W T van den Broek; R de Bree; P Jansen; S E J Eerenstein; C R Leemans; J M Zijlstra; P Cuijpers; L V van de Poll-Franse; I M Verdonck-de Leeuw; Cost-utility of an eHealth application 'Oncokompas' that supports cancer survivors in self-management: results of a randomised controlled trial, J Cancer Surviv, 2021 Feb; 15(1):1932-2267; 77-86",QALY,Netherlands,,Other,cancer survivor support app Oncokompas vs. usual care,"3-5 years post-treatment with curative intent, access to the internet and email address, sufficient mastery of the Dutch language, no severe cognitive impairment, not male breast cancer survivors, physical ability to complete a questionnaire",71 Years,56 Years,"Male, Female",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-95882.35,Euro,2017,-119778.59
33006,Cost-Effectiveness of Diagnostic Tools to Establish the Presence of Peripheral Arterial Disease in People with Diabetes,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of point-of-care duplex ultrasound (PAD-scan) and other bedside tests for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in people with diabetes. BACKGROUND: PAD is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetic foot ulceration (DFU) and amputation in diabetic patients. Diagnosis enables optimisation of therapies to manage these risks. PAD-scan can be performed by frontline staff and has been shown to be the most accurate bedside test. However, its cost-effectiveness has not been investigated. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the health outcomes and costs over 5?years of different testing strategies applied to a cohort of diabetic patients. Bedside tests investigated were PAD-scan, ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI), toe-brachial pressure index (TBPI), audible and visual Doppler, transcutaneous pressure of oxygen (TcPO2) and pulse palpation. Health outcomes were incidence of new DFU, major cardiovascular events, amputation, death and DFU healing rates. Sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: PAD-scan was the most cost-effective bedside test with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £11,391/QALY (quality adjusted life years). PAD-scan had the highest probability (78.7%) of having the greatest net benefit at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per QALY. It reduced the number of amputations by 24% and the number of cardiovascular deaths by 10% over 5?years, compared to TBPI (next best alternative).

33012,Cost-Effectiveness of Surveillance Scanning Strategies after Curative Treatment of Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer,"BACKGROUND: After curative treatment of primary non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), patients undergo intensive surveillance with the aim to detect recurrences from the primary tumor or metachronous second primary lung cancer as early as possible and improve overall survival. However, the benefit of surveillance is debated. Available evidence is of low quality and conflicting. Microsimulation modeling facilitates the exploration of the impact of different surveillance strategies and provides insight into the cost-effectiveness of surveillance. METHODS: A microsimulation model was used to simulate a range of computed tomography (CT)-based surveillance schedules, differing in the frequency and duration of CT surveillance. The impact on survival, quality-adjusted life-years, costs, and cost-effectiveness of each schedule was assessed. RESULTS: Ten of 108 strategies formed the cost-effectiveness frontier; that is, these were the strategies with the optimal cost-health benefit balance. Per person, the discounted QALYs of these strategies varied between 5.72 and 5.81 y, and discounted costs varied between €9892 and €19,259.

33021,Hepatitis C treatment strategies in prisons: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"In Australian prisons approximately 20% of inmates are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), providing an important population for targeted treatment and prevention. A dynamic mathematical model of HCV transmission was used to assess the impact of increasing direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment uptake on HCV incidence and prevalence in the prisons in New South Wales, Australia, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of alternate treatment strategies. We developed four separate models reflecting different average prison lengths of stay (LOS) of 2, 6, 24, and 36 months. Each model considered four DAA treatment coverage scenarios of 10% (status-quo), 25%, 50%, and 90% over 2016-2045. For each model and scenario, we estimated the lifetime burden of disease, costs and changes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in prison and in the community during 2016-2075. Costs and QALYs were discounted 3.5% annually and adjusted to 2015 Australian dollars. Compared to treating 10% of infected prisoners, increasing DAA coverage to 25%, 50%, and 90% reduced HCV incidence in prisons by 9-33% (2-months LOS), 26-65% (6-months LOS), 37-70% (24-months LOS), and 35-65% (36-months LOS). DAA treatment was highly cost-effective among all LOS models at conservative willingness-to-pay thresholds. DAA therapy became increasingly cost-effective with increasing coverage. Compared to 10% treatment coverage, the incremental cost per QALY ranged from $497-$569 (2-months LOS), -$280-$323 (6-months LOS), -$432-$426 (24-months LOS), and -$245-$477 (36-months LOS).

We developed four separate models reflecting different average prison lengths of stay (LOS) of 2, 6, 24, and 36 months. Each model considered four DAA treatment coverage scenarios of 10% (status-quo), 25%, 50%, and 90% over 2016-2045. For each model and scenario, we estimated the lifetime burden of disease, costs and changes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in prison and in the community during 2016-2075. Costs and QALYs were discounted 3.5% annually and adjusted to 2015 Australian dollars. Compared to treating 10% of infected prisoners, increasing DAA coverage to 25%, 50%, and 90% reduced HCV incidence in prisons by 9-33% (2-months LOS), 26-65% (6-months LOS), 37-70% (24-months LOS), and 35-65% (36-months LOS).

Early recognition and treatment of BDI has been shown to reduce costs and improve patients'' quality of life. The aim of this study was to assess the effect and cost-effectiveness of routine versus selective intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) in cholecystectomy. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis, combined with a health economic model analysis in the Swedish setting, was performed. Costs per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for routine versus selective IOC during cholecystectomy for different scenarios were calculated. RESULTS: In this meta-analysis, eight studies with more than 2 million patients subjected to cholecystectomy and 9000 BDIs were included. The rate of BDI was estimated to 0.36 per cent when IOC was performed routinely, compared with to 0.53 per cent when used selectively, indicating an increased risk for BDI of 43 per cent when IOC was used selectively (odds ratio 1.43, 95 per cent c.i. 1.22 to 1.67). The model analysis estimated that seven injuries were avoided annually by routine IOC in Sweden, a population of 10 million. Over a 10-year period, 33 QALYs would be gained at an approximate net cost of €808 000 , at a cost per QALY of about €24 900.

METHODS: Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) scores and RA-related healthcare resource utilization data (biologic agents and visits to rheumatologists) were extracted from a registry (Quebec, Canada) for patients with RA (n?=?129) who had to discontinue a first-line TNFi and were treated with rituximab, adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab as the second-line therapy between January 2007 and May 2016. A decision analytic model followed patients for 1 and 6?years. Treatment utility was measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, which were calculated from HAQ-DI scores observed over the follow-up time. Quebec 2020 unit costs (Canadian Dollars, $) were used to value healthcare resource consumption. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed with 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations to assess uncertainty around point-estimates of cost-utility. RESULTS: Over 1-year, rituximab and etanercept resulted in the effectiveness of 0.80 QALYs gained at the cost of $14,291and $18,880, respectively, and were dominant (i.e. associated with lower costs and more QALYs gained) compared to adalimumab (0.79 QALYs, $18,825) and infliximab (0.76 QALYs, $20,158).

33037,Cost-Effectiveness of Behavior Modification Intervention for Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease in the FROM-J Study,"OBJECTIVES: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a significant public health problem. An advanced, or innovative, CKD care system of clinical practice collaboration among general physicians (GPs), nephrologists, and other healthcare workers achieved behavior modification in patients with Stage 3 CKD in the Frontier of Renal Outcome Modifications in Japan (FROM-J) study. This behavior modification intervention consisted of educational sessions on nutrition and lifestyle, as well as encouragement of patients'' regular visits. The intervention contributed to slowing CKD progression. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the widespread diffusion of the behavior modification intervention proven effective by the FROM-J study. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out to compare the behavior modification intervention with the current practice recommended by the latest CKD clinical guidelines for GPs. A Markov model with a societal perspective under Japan''s health system was constructed. We assumed that the behavior modification intervention proven effective by the FROM-J study would be initiated by GPs for targeted patient cohorts-patients aged 40-74 years with Stage 3 CKD-as a part of the innovative CKD care system. RESULTS: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for the behavior modification intervention compared with current guideline-based practice was calculated as 145,593 Japanese yen (¥; $1,324 United States dollars [$]) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). CONCLUSIONS: Using the suggested value of social willingness to pay for a one-QALY gain in Japan of ¥5 million (US$45,455) as the threshold to judge cost-effectiveness, the behavior modification intervention is cost-effective. Our results suggest that diffusing the behavior modification intervention proven effective by the FROM-J study could be justifiable as an efficient use of finite healthcare resources. GPs could be encouraged to initiate this intervention by revising the National Health Insurance fee schedule and strengthening clinical guidelines regarding behavior modification interventions.",2021-01-34789,33744060,J Ren Nutr,Reiko Okubo,2021,/,,No,33744060,"Reiko Okubo; Masahide Kondo; Shu-Ling Hoshi; Masafumi Okada; Mariko Doi; Hideto Takahashi; Hirayasu Kai; Chie Saito; Kunitoshi Iseki; Chiho Iseki; Tsuyoshi Watanabe; Ichiei Narita; Seiichi Matsuo; Hirofumi Makino; Akira Hishida; Kunihiro Yamagata; Cost-Effectiveness of Behavior Modification Intervention for Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease in the FROM-J Study, J Ren Nutr, 2021 Mar 17; ():1532-8503",QALY,Japan,Renal failure,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior",Guideline-based practice with behavior modification vs. Guideline-based practice,Stage 3 chronic kidney disease,74 Years,40 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,1324,United States,2018,1428.73
33038,Very-low-dose aspirin and surveillance colonoscopy is cost-effective in secondary prevention of colorectal cancer in individuals with advanced adenomas: network meta-analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with advanced colorectal adenomas (ACAs) are at high risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), and it is unclear which chemopreventive agent (CPA) is safe and cost-effective for secondary prevention. We aimed to determine, firstly, the most suitable CPA using network meta-analysis (NMA) and secondly, cost-effectiveness of CPA with or without surveillance colonoscopy (SC). METHODS: Systematic review and NMA of randomised controlled trials were performed, and the most suitable CPA was chosen based on efficacy and the most favourable risk-benefit profile. The economic benefits of CPA alone, 3 yearly SC alone, and a combination of CPA and SC were determined using the cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) in the Malaysian health-care perspective. Outcomes were reported as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in 2018 US Dollars ($) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and life-years (LYs) gained. RESULTS: According to NMA, the risk-benefit profile favours the use of aspirin at very-low-dose (ASAVLD,?=?100 mg/day) for secondary prevention in individuals with previous ACAs. Celecoxib is the most effective CPA but the cardiovascular adverse events are of concern. According to CEA, the combination strategy (ASAVLD with 3-yearly SC) was cost-saving and dominates its competitors as the best buy option. The probability of being cost-effective for ASAVLD alone, 3-yearly SC alone, and combination strategy were 22%, 26%, and 53%, respectively. Extending the SC interval to five years in combination strategy was more cost-effective when compared to 3-yearly SC alone (ICER of $484/LY gain and $1875/QALY). However, extending to ten years in combination strategy was not cost-effective.

Methods: In the present study, we developed a Markov model under societal perspective to evaluate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of five birth cohorts of 100,000 Chinese infants across four alternative vaccination programs:1) no vaccination; 2) vaccinate 4 doses of new PCV-13 for children aged 2 to 6 months; 3) vaccinate 3 doses of new PCV-13 for children aged 7 to 11 months; 4) vaccinate 2 doses of new PCV-13 for children aged 12 to 23 months; 5) vaccinate 1 dose of new PCV-13 for children aged 2 to 5 years. We conducted one-way and probability sensitivity analysis to determine the uncertainty of the model findings. Results: We found that with awillingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of three-times Chinese per-capita gross domestic product (GDP) all vaccination programs were cost-effective compared to no vaccination and children aged 2 to 5 years received 1 dose of new PCV-13 would incur the lowest additional cost of US$2417 per quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs) compare with other vaccination programs ($15394/QALYs for 4 doses program, $9292/QALYs for 3 doses program, $4445/QALYs for 2 doses program).

33045,Cost-effectiveness analysis of percutaneous coronary intervention for single-vessel coronary artery disease: an economic evaluation of the ORBITA trial,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with placebo in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease and angina despite anti-anginal therapy. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis comparing PCI with placebo. A Markov model was used to measure incremental cost-effectiveness, in cost per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, over 12 months. Health utility weights were estimated using responses to the EuroQol 5-level questionnaire, from the Objective Randomised Blinded Investigation with optimal medical Therapy of Angioplasty in stable angina trial and UK preference weights. Costs of procedures and follow-up consultations were derived from Healthcare Resource Group reference costs and drug costs from the National Health Service (NHS) drug tariff. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was undertaken to test the robustness of results to parameter uncertainty. Scenario analyses were performed to test the effect on results of reduced pharmaceutical costs in patients undergoing PCI, and the effect of patients crossing over from placebo to PCI due to refractory angina within 12 months. SETTING: Five UK NHS hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: 200 adult patients with stable angina and angiographically severe single-vessel coronary artery disease on anti-anginal therapy. INTERVENTIONS: At recruitment, patients received 6 weeks of optimisation of medical therapy for angina after which they were randomised to PCI or a placebo procedure. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) expressed as cost (in £) per QALY gained for PCI compared with placebo. RESULTS: The estimated ICER is £90 218/QALY gained when using PCI compared with placebo in patients receiving medical treatment for angina due to single-vessel coronary artery disease. Results were robust under sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The ICER for PCI compared with placebo, in patients with single-vessel coronary artery disease and angina on anti-anginal medication, exceeds the threshold of £30?000 used by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence when undertaking health technology assessment for the NHS context.Trial registration: The ORBITA study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02062593.",2021-01-34806,33563623,BMJ Open,Victoria McCreanor,2021,11 / 2,e044054,No,33563623,"Victoria McCreanor; Alexandra Nowbar; Christopher Rajkumar; Adrian G Barnett; Darrel Francis; Nicholas Graves; William E Boden; William S Weintraub; Rasha Al-Lamee; William A Parsonage; Cost-effectiveness analysis of percutaneous coronary intervention for single-vessel coronary artery disease: an economic evaluation of the ORBITA trial, BMJ Open , 2021 Feb 5; 11(2):2044-6055; e044054",QALY,England,"Ischaemic heart diseases, Ischaemic heart diseases","Medical Procedure, Pharmaceutical",medical therapy + percutaneous coronary intervention procedure vs. medical therapy and placebo intervention,Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,12 Months,3.50,3.50,90218,United Kingdom,2019,122102.58

33049,Cost-effectiveness of TLC-NOSF dressings versus neutral dressings for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers in France,"This study assesses the cost-effectiveness of Technology Lipido-Colloid with Nano Oligo Saccharide Factor (TLC-NOSF) wound dressings versus neutral dressings in the management of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) from a French collective perspective. We used a Markov microsimulation cohort model to simulate the DFU monthly progression over the lifetime horizon. Our study employed a mixed method design with model inputs including data from interventional and observational studies, French databases and expert opinion. The demographic characteristics of the simulated population and clinical efficacy were based on the EXPLORER double-blind randomized controlled trial. Health-related quality of life, costs, and resource use inputs were taken from the literature relevant to the French context. The main outcomes included life-years without DFU (LYsw/DFU), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), amputations, and lifetime costs. To assess the robustness of the results, sensitivity and subgroup analyses based on the wound duration at treatment initiation were performed. Treatment with the TLC-NOSF dressing led to total cost savings per patient of EUR 35,489, associated with gains of 0.50 LYw/DFU and 0.16 QALY. TLC-NOSF dressings were established as the dominant strategy in the base case and all sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, the model revealed that, for every 100 patients treated with TLC-NOSF dressings, two amputations could be avoided. According to the subgroup analysis results, the sooner the TLC-NOSF treatment was initiated, the better were the outcomes, with the highest benefits for ulcers with a duration of two months or less (+0.65 LYw/DFU, +0.23 QALY, and cost savings of EUR 55,710). The results from the French perspective are consistent with the ones from the German and British perspectives. TLC-NOSF dressings are cost-saving compared to neutral dressings, leading to an increase in patients'' health benefits and a decrease in the associated treatment costs. These results can thus be used to guide healthcare decisionmakers. The potential savings could represent EUR 3,345 per treated patient per year and even reach EUR 4,771 when TLC-NOSF dressings are used as first line treatment.

33053,Cost-effectiveness of Brief Behavioral Therapy for Pediatric Anxiety and Depression in Primary Care,"IMPORTANCE: Youth anxiety and depression are common and undertreated. Pediatric transdiagnostic interventions for anxiety and/or depression may be associated with improved access to treatment among youths. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a pediatric transdiagnostic brief behavioral therapy (BBT) program for anxiety and/or depression compared with assisted referral to community outpatient mental health care (ARC). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the societal perspective using data from a randomized clinical trial of youths with full or probable diagnoses of anxiety or depression who were recruited from pediatric clinics in San Diego, California, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The trial was conducted from October 6, 2010, through December 5, 2014, and this analysis was performed from January 1, 2019, through October 20, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: In the randomized clinical trial, youths were randomized to BBT (n?=?95) or ARC (n?=?90). The BBT program consisted of 8 to 12 weekly 45-minute sessions of behavioral therapy delivered in pediatric clinics by master''s-level therapists. Families randomized to ARC received personalized referrals to mental health care and telephone calls to support access to care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Anxiety-free days, depression-free days, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and costs based on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios from intake through 32-week follow-up. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve for QALYs was used to assess the probability that BBT was cost-effective compared with ARC over a range of amounts that a decision-maker might be willing to pay for an additional outcome. RESULTS: Enrolled patients included 185 youths (mean [SD] age, 11.3 [2.6] years; 107 [57.8%] female; 144 [77.8%] White; and 38 [20.7%] Hispanic). Youths who received BBT experienced significantly more anxiety-free days (difference, 28.63 days; 95% CI, 5.86-50.71 days; P?=?.01) and QALYs (difference, 0.026; 95% CI, 0.009-0.046; P?=?.007) compared with youths who received ARC. Youths who received BBT experienced more depression-free days than did youths who received ARC (difference, 10.52 days; 95% CI, -4.50 to 25.76 days; P?=?.18), but the difference was not statistically significant. The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was -$41?414 per QALY (95% CI, -$220?601 to $11?468). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve analysis indicated that, at a recommended willingness-to-pay threshold of $50?000 per QALY, the probability that BBT would be cost-effective compared with ARC at 32 weeks was 95.6%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this economic evaluation, BBT in primary care was significantly associated with better outcomes and a greater probability of cost-effectiveness at 32 weeks compared with ARC. The findings suggest that transdiagnostic BBT may be associated with improved youth anxiety and functioning at a reasonable cost.",2021-01-34817,33720373,JAMA Netw Open,Frances L Lynch,2021,4 / 3,e211778,No,33720373,"Frances L Lynch; John F Dickerson; Michelle S Rozenman; Araceli Gonzalez; Karen T G Schwartz; Giovanna Porta; Maureen O'Keeffe-Rosetti; David Brent; V Robin Weersing; Cost-effectiveness of Brief Behavioral Therapy for Pediatric Anxiety and Depression in Primary Care, JAMA Netw Open, 2021 Mar 1; 4(3):2574-3805; e211778",QALY,United States of America,"Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence, Behavioural and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescence",Health Education or Behavior,Brief behavioral therapy in primary care vs. Assisted referral to community outpatient mental health care,Not Stated,17 Years,8 Years,"Male, Female",Full,32 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-34500,United States,2014,-39488.99
33054,The Cost-Effectiveness of Pre-school Peanut Oral Immunotherapy in the Real World Setting,"BACKGROUND: Across North America, 1.4-4.5% of children and families live with peanut allergy. Pre-school peanut oral immunotherapy (POIT) has been shown to be safe and effective in the real world setting. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pre-school POIT in North America. METHODS: Markov cohort analyses and microsimulation was used to evaluate simulated pre-school children with peanut allergy over an 80-year time horizon. Models incorporated the natural history of peanut allergy, comparing children treated with pre-school POIT with those not receiving immunotherapy. Costs were expressed in US and Canadian dollars. RESULTS: A pre-school POIT strategy was associated with cost-savings while improving quality-adjusted life years, dominating a non-immunotherapy approach. Over the model horizon, when all costs (and effectiveness) of peanut allergy were included from a societal perspective, a POIT vs non-POIT approach cost $82,514 (18.51 QALY) vs $84,367 (17.75 QALY) in the US, and $40,111 (18.83 QALY) vs $53,848 (18.26 QALY) in Canada.

33056,Cost-Effectiveness of Providing the Depression Care for People With Cancer Program to Patients With Prostate Cancer in the United States,"OBJECTIVES: The Depression Care for People with Cancer program (DCPC) is a cost-effective depression care model for UK patients with cancer. However, DCPC''s cost-effectiveness in the United States is unknown, particularly for patients with prostate cancer in the United States. This study evaluates the health and economic impact of providing DCPC to patients with prostate cancer. METHODS: DCPC was compared with usual care in a mathematical model that simulates depression and its outcomes in a hypothetical cohort of US patients with prostate cancer. DCPC was modeled as a sequential combination of universal depression screening, post-screening evaluations, and first-line combination therapy. Primary outcomes were lifetime direct costs of depression care, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Secondary outcomes included life expectancy, number of depression-free months and lifetime depressive episodes, duration of depressive episodes, cumulative incidence of depression, lifetime depression diagnoses/misdiagnoses, and the cumulative incidence of maintenance therapy for depression. Sensitivity analyses were used to examine uncertainty. RESULTS: In the base case, DCPC dominated usual care by offering 0.11 more QALYs for $2500 less per patient (from averted misdiagnoses). DCPC also offered 5 extra depression-free months, shorter depressive episodes, and a lower chance of maintenance therapy.

33057,Cost-effectiveness of bilateral versus single internal thoracic artery grafts at ten years,"OBJECTIVES: Using bilateral internal thoracic arteries (BITA) for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been suggested to improve survival compared to CABG using single internal thoracic arteries (SITA) for patients with advanced coronary artery disease. We used data from the Arterial Revascularisation Trial (ART) to assess long-term cost-effectiveness of BITA grafting compared to SITA grafting from an English health system perspective. METHODS: Resource use, healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were assessed across 10-years of follow-up from an intention-to-treat perspective. Missing data were addressed using multiple imputation. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated with uncertainty characterised using non-parametric bootstrapping. Results were extrapolated beyond 10?years using Gompertz functions for survival and linear models for total cost and utility. RESULTS: Total mean costs at 10?years follow-up were £17,594 in the BITA arm and £16,462 in the SITA arm (mean difference £1,133 95% CI £239 to £2,026, p?=?0.015). Total mean QALYs at 10?years were 6.54 in the BITA are and 6.57 in the SITA arm (adjusted mean difference -0.01 95% CI -0.2 to 0.1, p?=?0.883). At 10?years BITA grafting had a 33% probability of being cost-effective compared to SITA, assuming a cost-effectiveness threshold of £20,000. Lifetime extrapolation increased the probability of BITA being cost-effective to 51%. CONCLUSIONS: BITA grafting has significantly higher costs but similar quality-adjusted survival at 10?years compared to SITA grafting.

33058,Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence of Cost-Effectiveness of a Multifaceted AKI Intervention Approach,"INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with increased health care utilization and higher costs. The Tackling AKI study was a multicenter, pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial that demonstrated a reduced hospital length of stay after implementation of a multifaceted AKI intervention (e-alerts, care bundle, and an education program). We tested whether this would result in cost savings. METHODS: A decision-analytic tree model from the payer perspective (National Health Service in the United Kingdom) was generated on which cost-effectiveness analyses were performed using a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, accounting only for direct medical costs. Clinical data from the Tackling AKI study were used as inputs and economic and utility data derived from relevant published literature. RESULTS: A total of 24,059 AKI episodes occurred during the study period, and in 18,887 admissions the patient was discharged alive. When all AKI stages were considered together, the cost per AKI admission was £5065 in the control arm and £4333 in the intervention arm, representing an incremental cost saving of £732 per admission with the intervention. Similar results were obtained when AKI stages were included as separate variables. Costs per quality-adjusted life year were £61,194 in the control group and £51,161 in the intervention group. At a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per quality-adjusted life year, the probability of the intervention being cost-effective compared with standard care was 90%. CONCLUSION: An organizational level approach to improve standards of AKI care reduces the cost of hospital admissions and is cost effective within the National Health Service in the United Kingdom.",2021-01-34842,33732978,Kidney Int Rep,Nicholas M Selby,2021,6 / 3,636-644,No,33732978,"Nicholas M Selby; Luís Korrodi-Gregório; Anna Casula; Nitin V Kolhe; Daniel Ribes Arbonés; Katelyn D Bukieda; Deepak Sahu; Chris Rao; Giacomo Basadonna; Randomized Controlled Trial Evidence of Cost-Effectiveness of a Multifaceted AKI Intervention Approach, Kidney Int Rep, 2021 Mar; 6(3):2468-0249; 636-644",QALY,United Kingdom,Renal failure,"Care Delivery, Health Education or Behavior","Acute kidney injury e-alerts, care bundle, and education program vs. Standard of care","had been hospitalized for >=1night, sustained acute kidney injury during the hospitalization",Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,Not Stated / None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2020,Not Stated
33059,Estimating the cost-effectiveness of screening a general population for cardiovascular risk with high-sensitivity troponin-I,"AIMS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of using the cardiac specific marker high-sensitivity troponin-I (hsTnI) for assessing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in a general population. METHODS AND RESULTS: A discrete-event simulation model was developed from a societal perspective of a low-risk (Germany) and a high-risk (Kazakhstan) country. The model compared a screen-and-prevent strategy guided by hsTnI against a do-nothing strategy. Risk functions were derived from published data of a prospective cohort study (Nord-Trøndelag Health (HUNT) Study). The model assessed the number of CVD events and deaths, healthy life years, direct and indirect costs in PPP 2018 Dollar, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) over a time horizon of ten years. Screen-and-prevent reduced the number of CVD events per 1,000 subjects by 5.1 and 5.0, equal to a number-needed-to-screen of 195 and 191 in Kazakhstan and Germany. Screen-and-prevent was cost-saving in Kazakhstan and cost-effective in Germany with an incremental-cost-effectiveness ratio of $6,755 ($2,294; $24,054) per QALY gained at an opportunity-cost based willingness-to-pay threshold of $27,373. Varying input variables in univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the analysis. CONCLUSION: Assessing the cardiovascular risk with hsTnI in a general population and subsequently referring those at high risk to preventive means would very likely be cost-effective or cost-saving by avoiding CVD events and associated direct and indirect costs. This conclusion is retained even if only the direct costs or only the costs for screening and prevention are considered.

33064,Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Parenteral Methotrexate for the Treatment of Crohn's Disease,"BACKGROUND: Despite worldwide use of parenteral methotrexate (pMTX), health economic evidence for its use in Crohn''s disease (CD) is limited. The low price of this generic drug has removed any commercial incentive to further invest in research. However, there is an unmet need for treatment of mild-to-moderate CD, since biological/targeted therapies are usually reserved for patients with more severe disease due to the higher costs of these treatments. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pMTX compared to the standard of care (SOC, i.e., high doses of oral corticosteroids (hdCS) followed by gradual tapering) for the treatment of mild-to-moderate CD in the Czech Republic. METHODS: We developed a 3-year Markov model with a 1-week cycle length comprising five health states. The model projected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and costs from the healthcare payers'' perspective. Efficacy data were obtained from a systematic literature review of clinical trials and extrapolated using survival analysis. RESULTS: Over a 3-year time-horizon, pMTX yields additional 0.111 QALYs (1.798 vs. 1.687) at an additional cost of €513 (€3087 vs. €2574), with an incremental deterministic (probabilistic) cost-effectiveness ratio of €4627 (€4742)/QALY, far below the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold (˜ €47,000/QALY). The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of pMTX being cost-effective was 100%. A one-way sensitivity and scenario analysis confirmed the robustness of the base-case result. CONCLUSION: Parenteral MTX proved to be cost-effective in patients with mild-to-moderate CD. This is the first published cost-effectiveness analysis of pMTX for this indication. It also shows an example of a lack of valuation of generic therapy despite its cost-effectiveness and a clear benefit to the healthcare system.",2021-01-34529,33426625,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Tomas Mlcoch,2021,/,,Yes,33426625,"Tomas Mlcoch; Barbora Decker; Tomas Dolezal; Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Parenteral Methotrexate for the Treatment of Crohn's Disease, Appl Health Econ Health Policy, 2021 Mar 2; ():1179-1896",QALY,Czech Republic,Noninfective enteritis and colitis,Pharmaceutical,Parenteral methotrexate vs. High doses of oral corticosteroids followed by gradual tapering,"Patients with mild-moderate Crohn's disease, not responding to high-dose corticosteroids",Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,3 Years,3.00,3.00,4627,Euro,2018,5900.21
33065,Cost-effectiveness analysis of sequential fecal microbiota transplantation for fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Fulminant Clostridioides difficile infections (FCDI) account for 8% of cases and substantial healthcare burden. Fecal microbiota transplantation is recommended for recurrent CDI, but emerging data support use for FCDI. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a sequential fecal microbiota transplantation (sFMT) protocol for FCDI compared with current standard therapy. METHODS: A Markov model simulated patients with FCDI in a 1-year time horizon. The treatment algorithm for up to three sFMTs, clinical probabilities, and direct costs were used from published sources. Outcomes were quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and costs. The healthcare sector perspective was used with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100 000 per QALY. RESULTS: Sequential fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) for FCDI was associated with lower overall cost ($28 309 vs $33 980) and higher QALY (0.765 vs 0.686) compared with standard therapy. sFMT is cost-effective in 100% of iterations. sFMT remained cost-effective at cure rates > 44.8% for the first FMT and at stool preparation cost < $6944 per instillation. We find a wide range of efficacies for the first versus second FMT at which sFMT is still preferred. Value of information analysis estimates the expected value of perfect information to be low at $1.89 per person, quantified with net monetary benefit. CONCLUSIONS: An sFMT strategy strongly dominates standard therapy, with lower cost and higher QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates benefit even if FMT cure rates are lower than expected and when multiple FMTs are required. FMT material in 2020 was priced at $1695 per treatment but remains cost-effective at a much higher cost.",2021-01-34534,33682170,J Gastroenterol Hepatol,Sanchit Gupta,2021,/,,No,33682170,"Sanchit Gupta; Jinyi Zhu; Thomas R McCarty; Jordan Pruce; Zain Kassam; Colleen Kelly; Monika Fischer; Jessica R Allegretti; Huijuan Wang; Lingfei Huang; Peng Gao; Zhengyi Zhu; Weifeng Ye; Haiying Ding; Luo Fang; Chatlert Pongchaiyakul; Ratanavadee Nanagara; Thawee Songpatanasilp; Aasis Unnanuntana; Cost-effectiveness analysis of sequential fecal microbiota transplantation for fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection, J Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2021 Mar 7; ():0815-9319",QALY,United States of America,Intestinal infectious diseases,Medical Procedure,Sequential fecal microbiota transplantation vs. Standard therapy (vancomycin 500mgx4/day + intravenous metronidazole 1500mg/day),Not Stated,Not Stated,18 Years,"Male, Female",Full,"1 Year, Lifetime",Not Stated,Not Stated,-71784.81,United States,2019,-76084.48

33068,A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Nivolumab Plus Ipilimumab Versus Pembrolizumab Plus Axitinib and Versus Avelumab Plus Axitinib in First-Line Treatment of Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma,"BACKGROUND: There now exist several viable first-line treatment options for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, making the choice of initial therapy difficult. Considering metrics other than patient factors may be necessary to select the most appropriate therapy. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the three combination therapies currently approved in treatment-naïve advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma-nivolumab + ipilimumab (NI), pembrolizumab + axitinib (PA), and avelumab + axitinib (AA)-from a US payer perspective. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Our analysis was performed based on previously obtained data derived from progression-free survival and overall survival curves from CheckMate 214, KEYNOTE 426, and JAVELIN Renal 101. RESULTS: The total costs of each treatment were found to be $437,556.12 for NI, $450,597.15 for PA, and $542,882.34 for AA, with quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) values of 4.04, 3.77, and 2.95 for each combination, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of NI versus PA was ($47,504.73/QALY); for NI versus AA, it was ($96,533.11/QALY); for PA versus AA, it was ($113,015.87/QALY). Net health benefit scaled against a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000 per QALY was positive for NI versus PA at 0.36 and versus AA at 1.79, and this index was also positive for PA versus AA at 1.43, indicating that the additional value of these therapies versus their alternatives is greater than the extra cost.

33088,Value of treatment by comprehensive stroke services for the reduction of critical gaps in acute stroke care in Europe,"Stroke is the second leading cause of death and dependency in Europe and costs the European Union more than €30bn, yet significant gaps in the patient pathway remain and the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive stroke care to meet these needs is unknown. The European Brain Council Value of Treatment Initiative combined patient representatives, stroke experts, neurological societies and literature review to identify unmet needs in the patient pathway according to Rotterdam methodology. The cost-effectiveness of comprehensive stroke services was determined by a Markov model, using UK cost data as an exemplar and efficacy data for prevention of death and dependency from published systematic reviews and trials, expressing effectiveness as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Model outcomes included total costs, total QALYs, incremental costs, incremental QALYs and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Key unmet needs in the stroke patient pathway included inadequate treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF), access to neurorehabilitation and implementation of comprehensive stroke services. In the Markov model, full implementation of comprehensive stroke services was associated with a 9.8% absolute reduction in risk of death of dependency, at an intervention cost of £9566 versus £6640 for standard care, and long-term care costs of £35 169 per 5.1251 QALYS vs. £32 347.40 per 4.5853 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of £5227.89. Results were robust in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

33089,Cost-Effectiveness of Pediatric Influenza Vaccination in The Netherlands,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of extending the Dutch influenza vaccination program for elderly and medical high-risk groups to include pediatric influenza vaccination, taking indirect protection into account. METHODS: An age-structured dynamic transmission model was used that was calibrated to influenza-associated GP visits over 4 seasons (2010-2011 to 2013-2014). The clinical and economic impact of different pediatric vaccination strategies were compared over 20 years, varying the targeted age range, the vaccine type for children or elderly and high-risk groups. Outcome measures include averted symptomatic infections and deaths, societal costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 4% and 1.5% annually. RESULTS: At an assumed coverage of 50%, adding pediatric vaccination for 2- to 17-year-olds with quadrivalent live-attenuated vaccine to the current vaccination program for elderly and medical high-groups with quadrivalent inactivated vaccine was estimated to avert, on average, 401 820 symptomatic cases and 72 deaths per year. Approximately half of averted symptomatic cases and 99% of averted deaths were prevented in other age groups than 2- to 17-year-olds due to herd immunity. The cumulative discounted 20-year economic impact was 35 068 QALYs gained and €1687 million saved, that is, the intervention was cost-saving. This vaccination strategy had the highest probability of being the most cost-effective strategy considered, dominating pediatric strategies targeting 2- to 6-year-olds or 2- to 12-year-olds or strategies with trivalent inactivated vaccine.

33094,Cost-Effectiveness of Pediatric Influenza Vaccination in The Netherlands,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of extending the Dutch influenza vaccination program for elderly and medical high-risk groups to include pediatric influenza vaccination, taking indirect protection into account. METHODS: An age-structured dynamic transmission model was used that was calibrated to influenza-associated GP visits over 4 seasons (2010-2011 to 2013-2014). The clinical and economic impact of different pediatric vaccination strategies were compared over 20 years, varying the targeted age range, the vaccine type for children or elderly and high-risk groups. Outcome measures include averted symptomatic infections and deaths, societal costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 4% and 1.5% annually. RESULTS: At an assumed coverage of 50%, adding pediatric vaccination for 2- to 17-year-olds with quadrivalent live-attenuated vaccine to the current vaccination program for elderly and medical high-groups with quadrivalent inactivated vaccine was estimated to avert, on average, 401 820 symptomatic cases and 72 deaths per year. Approximately half of averted symptomatic cases and 99% of averted deaths were prevented in other age groups than 2- to 17-year-olds due to herd immunity.
