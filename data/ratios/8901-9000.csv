8901,A cost-effectiveness analysis of different therapies in patients with chronic hepatitis B in Italy,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a prevalent disease associated with high morbidity, mortality, and impact on health care costs. Antiviral therapy is aimed at reducing hepatitis B virus replication in order to limit progressive liver disease and improve the natural history of the disease. This study estimates the cost-effectiveness of lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, entecavir, tenofovir, and pegylated interferon in patients with CHB.A Markov model was developed to evaluate the costs and benefits of antivirals in a cohort of patients with CHB (hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]-positive and HBeAg-negative) and cirrhosis over a period of 10 years. Different rescue therapies were considered, according to current guidelines. Data on efficacy and changes in quality of life were derived from clinical trials and epidemiological Italian data. Direct costs were assessed from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service.Tenofovir was associated with lower costs and higher efficacy compared with entecavir, telbivudine, and adefovir, as shown by their incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained: tenofovir ?30,959, entecavir ?45,971, telbivudine ?62,051, and adefovir ?82,824. Even following 1 year of pegylated interferon therapy, tenofovir had a more favourable ICER per QALY gained compared with the other rescue options. The analysis of patients with cirrhosis confirms the results obtained with the CHB cohort though with higher ICERs. Sensitivity analyses on the main variables confirm the results of the base case scenario.Within the Italian health care system, in patients with CHB, tenofovir is a cost-effective strategy compared with other available therapies. Public health care authorities would benefit from mathematical models designed to estimate the future burden of CHB infection together with the impact of treatment and drug resistance.",2011-01-10599,21935331,Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,Giorgio L Colombo,2011,3 /,37-46,No,21935331,"Giorgio L Colombo; Giovanni B Gaeta; Mauro Vigan?; Sergio Di Matteo; A cost-effectiveness analysis of different therapies in patients with chronic hepatitis B in Italy, Clinicoecon Outcomes Res , ; 3 ():1178-6981; 37-46",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Tenofovir vs. None,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,0.00,31291,Euro,2009,52604.35

8913,Cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronisation therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure: a lifetime Markov model,"Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) both with CRT-P (biventricular pacemaker only) and with CRT-D (biventricular pacemaker with defibrillator) in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV from a Belgian healthcare-payer perspective. Methods A lifetime Markov model was designed to calculate the cost-utility of both interventions. In the reference case, the treatment effect was based on the Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing and Defibrillation in Heart Failure trial. Costs were based on real-world data. Pharmacoeconomic guidelines were applied, including probabilistic modelling and sensitivity analyses. Results Compared with optimal medical treatment, on average 1.31 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) are gained with CRT-P at an additional cost of ?14?700, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of about ?11?200/QALY. As compared with CRT-P, CRT-D treatment adds on average an additional 0.55 QALYs at an extra cost of ?30?900 resulting in an ICER of ?57?000/QALY. This result was very sensitive to the incremental clinical benefit of the defibrillator function on top of CRT. Conclusions Based on efficiency arguments, CRT-P can be recommended for NYHA class III and IV patients if there is a willingness to pay more than ?11?000/QALY. Even though CRT-D may offer a survival benefit over CRT-P, the incremental clinical benefit appears to be too marginal to warrant a threefold-higher device price for CRT-D.

8914,Cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronisation therapy for patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure: a lifetime Markov model,"Objective To assess the cost-effectiveness of cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) both with CRT-P (biventricular pacemaker only) and with CRT-D (biventricular pacemaker with defibrillator) in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class III/IV from a Belgian healthcare-payer perspective. Methods A lifetime Markov model was designed to calculate the cost-utility of both interventions. In the reference case, the treatment effect was based on the Comparison of Medical Therapy, Pacing and Defibrillation in Heart Failure trial. Costs were based on real-world data.

8915,"Cost-Benefit Analysis of Endocrine Therapy in the Adjuvant Setting for Postmenopausal Patients with Hormone Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer, Based on Survival Data and Future Prices for Generic Drugs in the Context of the German Health Care System","BACKGROUND: Cost-effectiveness analyses have focused on aromatase inhibitors (AIs), but the results are inconsistent and disease-free survival has often been extrapolated to overall survival. The present study calculates the cost-effectiveness of 5 years of letrozole versus tamoxifen versus anastrozole in the context of the German health care system, using survival data from the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 study and the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) study and generic prices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hybrid model was developed that incorporates recurrence rates, overall survival, treatment costs and treatment-associated adverse events and the resulting costs. The basic assumption was that generic anastrozole would lead to a price reduction to 75% of the original price. Further analyses were carried out with 50% and 25% of the original prices for anastrozole and letrozole. RESULTS: The cost-benefit model showed a gain of 0.3124 or 0.0659 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for letrozole or anastrozole. Incremental costs of ? 29,375.15/QALY for letrozole (100% of original price) were calculated and ? 94,648.03/QALY for anastrozole (75% of original price). Marked increases in cost-effectiveness are observed with further decreases in price (anastrozole: 50% price ? 54,715.17/QALY, 25% price ? 14,779.57/QALY; letrozole 75% price ? 20,988.59/QALY, 50% price ? 12,602.03/QALY, 25% price ? 4,215.46/QALY).

8917,Health economic assessment for screening of gastric cancer in a high risk population in northeastern china,"To assess economic cost-effects for the screening programs of gastric cancer in a high risk population in northeastern China.The data were collected from November 2001 to December 2003. The multi-stage sampling to define the screening group and the control group was applied in this study. Two stage screening programs were used in the study. An epidemiological survey and serum PG test were carried out in the first stage. The endoscopy and pathological examination were performed in the second stage screening. Effectiveness was assessed by the increased quality adjusted life-year (QALY) because of reduced gastric cancer deaths in screening.A total of 27,970 participants (n=7,128 screening group, n=20,842 control group) were enrolled in the survey. Twenty nine gastric cancer cases were detected in the screening group with 20 cases in the early stage and 9 cases in the advanced stage, respectively. Eighty six gastric cancer cases were detected in the control group, all of whom were in the advanced stage and had died before the study finished. The screening and treatment of 29 cases cost $152,227 and $5,249 per each case, respectively. The costs were $459 to gain per QALY.The screening program of gastric cancer used in our study is an economic and society-beneficial measure to detect gastric cancer in high risk area.
