3101,Reassessment of the cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy in Sweden: results based on the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the study is to reassess the cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) based on new medical evidence found in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). Within a model framework using an individual state transition model, the cost-effectiveness of 50- to 60-year-old women with menopausal symptoms is assessed based on a societal perspective in Sweden. METHODS: The model has a 50-year time horizon divided into a cycle length of 1 year. The model consists of the following disease states: coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolic events, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, vertebral fracture, and wrist fracture. An intervention is modeled by its impact on the disease risks during and after the cessation of therapy. The model calculates costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with and without intervention. The resulting cost per QALY gained is compared with the value of a QALY gained, which is set to SEK 600,000. The model requires data on clinical effects, risks, mortality rates, quality of life weights, and costs valid for Sweden. RESULTS: The cost-effectiveness ratios are estimated at approximately SEK 10,000, which is below the threshold value of cost-effectiveness. On the condition that HRT increases the quality of life weight more than 0.013 units, the therapy is cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, given the new evidence in WHI, there is still a high probability that HRT is a cost-effective strategy for women with menopausal symptoms.",2005-01-01634,16262965,Int J Technol Assess Health Care,Niklas Zethraeus,2005,21 / 4,433-41,No,16262965,"Niklas Zethraeus; Fredrik Borgström; Bengt Jönsson; John Kanis; Fredrik Borgström; Bengt Jönsson; John Kanis; Reassessment of the cost-effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy in Sweden: results based on the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial, Int J Technol Assess Health Care, 2005; 21(4):0266-4623; 433-41",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Combination therapy,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,Female,Full,50 Years,3.00,3.00,10844,Sweden,2003,1892.91

3106,A Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Two Rehabilitation Support Services for Women with Breast Cancer,"The purpose of this research was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of two rehabilitation interventions for breast cancer survivors, each compared to a population-based, non-intervention group (n = 208). The two services included an early home-based physiotherapy intervention (DAART, n = 36) and a group-based exercise and psychosocial intervention (STRETCH, n = 31). A societal perspective was taken and costs were included as those incurred by the health care system, the survivors and community. Health outcomes included: (a) 'rehabilitated cases' based on changes in health-related quality of life between 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis, using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast Cancer plus Arm Morbidity (FACT-B+4) questionnaire, and (b) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) using utility scores from the Subjective Health Estimation (SHE) scale. Data were collected using self-reported questionnaires, medical records and program budgets. A Monte-Carlo modelling approach was used to test for uncertainty in cost and outcome estimates. The proportion of rehabilitated cases was similar across the three groups. From a societal perspective compared with the non-intervention group, the DAART intervention appeared to be the most efficient option with an incremental cost of $1344 per QALY gained, whereas the incremental cost per QALY gained from the STRETCH program was $14,478.

3108,Is Adjuvant Therapy for Older Patients with Node (+) Early Breast Cancercost-effective?*,"Background: Node (+) breast cancer represents over 40% of cases in older women and currently there is a debate whether adjuvant therapy for all older women is cost-effective.Purpose: To evaluate if adjuvant treatment for early-stage (Stage I-IIIa) node (+) breast cancer with hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or combination therapy is cost-effective in older patients.Design: A decision-analysis model for 65, 75, and 85 year-old female breast cancer patients using life tables integrated the cost of treatment in dollars and impact in length and quality of life. Both estrogen receptor (ER) (-) and (+) patients were considered. The primary data sources were meta-analysis from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group and the Red Book Average Wholesale Price for drugs. The cost of treatment in dollars and impact of quality of life was examined. Scenarios were used when treatment benefit was uncertain. The incremental cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies were then compared and mapped graphically.Results: Adjuvant therapy is cost-effective in 65 year-old women with early breast cancer. In a 75 year-old ER (+) patient, hormone therapy is cost-effective, $10,965/quality-adjusted life years (QALY), but chemotherapy was more cost-effective, $27,406/QALY, if one assumed it was as efficacious as in a 65 year-old woman. In a 75 year-old ER (-) patient, chemotherapy was cost-effective at $42,605 with the same assumption. In an 85 year-old ER (+) patient, hormone therapy was cost-effective, $26,463/QALY, if efficacy is not age-sensitive, but chemotherapy was not as cost-effective for either ER (+) or ER (-) patients.Conclusion: Treatment decisions for older breast cancer patients suffer from the lack of sufficient clinical trial data.

3109,Is it worth offering a routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy in developing countries? A Thailand case study,"OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate whether laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is a cost-effective strategy for managing gallbladder-stone disease compared to the conventional open cholecystectomy (OC) in a Thai setting. DESIGN AND SETTING: Using a societal perspective a cost-utility analysis was employed to measure programme cost and effectiveness of each management strategy. The costs borne by the hospital and patients were collected from Chiang Rai regional hospital while the clinical outcomes were summarised from a published systematic review of international and national literature. Incremental cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) derived from a decision tree model. RESULTS: The results reveal that at base-case scenario the incremental cost per QALY of moving from OC to LC is 134,000 Baht under government perspective and 89,000 Baht under a societal perspective. However, the probabilities that LC outweighed OC are not greater than 95% until the ceiling ratio reaches 190,000 and 270,000 Baht per QALY using societal and government perspective respectively. CONCLUSION: The economic evaluation results of management options for gallstone disease in Thailand differ from comparable previous studies conducted in developed countries which indicated that LC was a cost-saving strategy. Differences were due mainly to hospital costs of post operative inpatient care and value of lost working time.

3111,Economic consequence of local control with radiotherapy: cost analysis of internal mammary and medial supraclavicular lymph node radiotherapy in breast cancer,"PURPOSE: To investigate the financial implications of radiotherapy (RT) to the internal mammary and medial supraclavicular lymph node chain (IM-MS) in postoperative breast cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis were performed, using Markov models, comparing the early and delayed costs and effects of IM-MS during a 20-year time span from a societal viewpoint. The outcome estimates were based on Level I evidence from postoperative RT literature and the cost estimates on the standard practice of the Leuven University Hospitals, with the RT costs derived from an activity-based costing program developed in the department. RESULTS: On the basis of the assumptions of the model and seen during a 20-year time span, primary treatment including IM-MS RT results in a cost savings (approximately 10,000) compared with a strategy without RT. Because IM-MS RT also results in better clinical effectiveness and greater quality of life, the treatment with IM-MS dominates the approach without IM-MS. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these results in all tested circumstances. Although threshold values were found for the cost of IM-MS, the cost at relapse, and the quality of life after treatment, these were substantially different from the baseline estimates, indicating that it is very unlikely that omitting IM-MS would become superior. CONCLUSION: This ex-ante cost evaluation of IM-MS RT showed that the upfront costs of locoregional RT are easily compensated for by avoiding the costs of treating locoregional and distant relapse at a later stage. The cost-sparing effect of RT should, however, be evaluated for a sufficiently long time span and is most specifically found in tumors with a rather slow natural history and a multitude of available systemic treatments at relapse, such as breast cancer.",2005-01-01642,16253774,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,Yolande Lievens,2005,63 / 4,1122-31,No,16253774,"Yolande Lievens; Katrien Kesteloot; Walter van den Bogaert; Katrien Kesteloot; Walter van den Bogaert; Economic consequence of local control with radiotherapy: cost analysis of internal mammary and medial supraclavicular lymph node radiotherapy in breast cancer, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys, 2005-Nov-15; 63(4):0360-3016; 1122-31",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Lymph node radiation therapy vs. No radiation therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,-44052.86,Euro,2000,-61123.93

Subjects were 1398 obese individuals who participated in three large European Phase III trials of orlistat treatment for adults (BMI: 28-47 kg m(-2)). Measures were: response to treatment in orlistat and placebo treatment groups; health benefit expressed as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained associated with weight loss; costs associated with orlistat treatment. In the cost utility model with multiway sensitivity analysis, the cost/QALY gained using the NICE criteria was estimated to be 24,431 pounds (sensitivity analysis range: 10,856 to 77,197 pounds). The cost/QALY gained using the alternative EMEA criteria was estimated to be 19,005 pounds (range: 8,840 to 57,798 pounds). In conclusion, NICE guidance for the continued use of orlistat was supported in this updated cost utility model, comparing favourably with a previously published estimate of 45,881 pounds per QALY gained.

Therefore initial choice of treatment has long-term cost implications. The aim was to compare the costs and effectiveness of treatment of GORD the (unconfirmed by endoscopy) with seven proton pump inhibitors (PPIs: esomeprazole, lansoprazole (capsules and oro-dispersible tablets), omeprazole (generic and branded), pantoprazole and rabeprazole), over one year. DESIGN AND METHODS: A treatment model was developed of 13 interconnected Markov models incorporating acute treatment of symptoms, long-term therapy and subsequent decisions to undertake endoscopy to confirm diagnosis. Patients were allowed to stop treatment or to receive maintenance treatment either continuously or on-demand depending on response to therapy. Long-term dosing schedule (high dose or step-down dose) was based on current market data. Efficacy of treatments was based on clinical trials and follow-up studies, while resource use patterns were determined by a panel of physicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The model predicts total expected annual costs, number of symptom-free days and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY). RESULTS: Generic omeprazole and rabeprazole dominated (i.e. cost less and resulted in more symptom-free days and higher QALY gains) the other PPIs. Rabeprazole had a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio of 3.42 pounds per symptom-free day and 8308 pounds/quality-adjusted life-year gained when compared with generic omeprazole. Rabeprazole remained cost-effective independent of choice of maintenance treatment (i.e. proportion of patients remaining on continuous treatment versus on-demand treatment).CONCLUSIONS: Economic models provide a useful framework to evaluate PPIs in realistic clinical scenarios.

3120,The cost effectiveness of orlistat in a 1-year weight-management programme for treating overweight and obese patients in Sweden : a treatment responder approach,"OBJECTIVE: To calculate the cost effectiveness (from the Swedish healthcare perspective) of orlistat plus diet for an obese and overweight population in a 1-year weight-management responder programme versus a 1-year weight-management programme based on diet only. As a reference, orlistat plus diet and diet only were also compared with a no-diet alternative. METHOD: Costs and effectiveness were calculated in a decision-tree model by means of Monte Carlo simulation. Efficacy was derived from a pooled analysis of the orlistat clinical trial programme. Acquisition costs for orlistat (euro, 2003 prices), healthcare costs for visits to doctors and dieticians related to weight management, and costs related to the difference in diabetes mellitus incidence between treatment arms were included in the analysis. The health benefit of temporary weight loss was measured in the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: The number of responding (those with >5% weight loss) patients at month 3 was almost twice as high with orlistat compared with diet only: 48.9% versus 26.3%. Responding orlistat patients had a weight loss of 15.5% at month 12 compared with 7.9% for all patients on diet only. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY gained versus diet only was estimated to be 13,125 euro for the average patient starting on orlistat. When orlistat was compared with no diet, the cost effectiveness was improved. However, comparing diet only with no diet gave a slightly higher ICER, indicating that orlistat had an extended dominance over the diet-only alternative. CONCLUSION: Our estimates indicated that orlistat in a 12-month dietary responder programme increased the number of QALYs and reduced the cumulative incidence of diabetes compared with diet only. Patients starting on orlistat in addition to a dietary programme achieved an ICER that was similar to many other well accepted healthcare treatment programmes. In order to improve the precision of our calculations, we need to confirm the key assumptions regarding temporary weight loss and utility gains, and the relationship between temporary weight loss and diabetes, as well as other co-morbidities, and to have better knowledge of the long-term impact of weight-management programmes in clinical practice, such as changes in weight-controlling behaviours and sustainability of weight loss.",2005-01-01651,16235974,Pharmacoeconomics,Peter Hertzman,2005,23 / 10,1007-20,Yes,16235974,"Peter Hertzman; The cost effectiveness of orlistat in a 1-year weight-management programme for treating overweight and obese patients in Sweden : a treatment responder approach, Pharmacoeconomics, 2005; 23(10):1179-2027; 1007-20",QALY,Sweden,Not Stated,Not Stated,Orlistat plus diet (1 year) vs. Diet alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,3.00,3.00,13125,Euro,2003,20899.34
3121,Surveillance for isocyanate asthma: a model based cost effectiveness analysis,"AIMS: Because logistical and financial obstacles impede using large prospective cohort studies, surveillance decisions in occupational settings must often be made without evidence of relative benefits and costs. Using the example of isocyanate induced asthma, the most commonly reported immune mediated occupational asthma, the authors developed a model based approach to evaluate the costs and benefits of surveillance from both an employer and a societal perspective. METHODS: The authors used a mathematical simulation model of isocyanate asthma to compare annual surveillance to passive case finding. Outcome measures included symptom free days (SFD), quality adjusted life years (QALY), direct costs, productivity losses, and incremental cost effectiveness ratio (CER), measured from the employer and the societal perspectives. Input data were obtained from a variety of published sources. RESULTS: For 100,000 exposed workers, surveillance resulted in 683 fewer cases of disability over 10 years. Surveillance conferred benefits at an incremental cost of 24,000 dollars/QALY (employer perspective; 13.33 dollars/SFD) and was cost saving from the societal perspective. Results were sensitive to assumptions about sensitisation rate, removal rates, and time to diagnosis, but not to assumptions about therapy costs and disability rates. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline results placed the CER for surveillance for isocyanate asthma within the acceptable range. Costs from the societal and employer perspective differed substantially with a more attractive CER from the societal perspective, suggesting opportunities for employer/societal cost sharing. The analysis demonstrates the value of a model based approach to evaluate the cost effectiveness of surveillance programmes for isocyanate asthma, and to inform shared decision making among clinicians, patients, employers, and society. Such a modeling approach may be applicable to surveillance programmes for other work related conditions.",2005-01-01654,16234399,Occup Environ Med,D M Wild,2005,62 / 11,743-9,No,16234399,"D M Wild; C A Redlich; A D Paltiel; C A Redlich; A D Paltiel; Surveillance for isocyanate asthma: a model based cost effectiveness analysis, Occup Environ Med, 2005-Nov; 62(11):1470-7926; 743-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Surveillance with screening vs. Standard care,Not Stated,65 Years,18 Years,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,24000,United States,2002,34527.32
3122,Erythropoietic growth factors for treatment-induced anemia in hepatitis C: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment-induced anemia undermines the efficacy of antiviral therapy in hepatitis C by mandating ribavirin dose reduction and diminishing adherence to therapy. Erythropoietic growth factors (EGFs) may correct treatment-induced anemia, facilitate maintenance of full-dose therapy, and improve rates of sustained virologic response (SVR). We sought to determine the cost effectiveness of adjunctive treatment with an EGF vs standard care in the treatment of hepatitis C. METHODS: We used a decision analysis to calculate the cost effectiveness of 2 treatment strategies for a patient cohort with chronic hepatitis C, increased transaminase levels, and no cirrhosis who were receiving pegylated-interferon and ribavirin (RBV): (1) RBV dose-reduction for anemia, followed by discontinuation of therapy if anemia persisted (standard care strategy), (2) adjunctive treatment with EGF therapy for anemia, with RBV dose reduction reserved for persistent anemia despite EGF therapy (EGF strategy). We conducted cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses to compare short- and long-term outcomes between the strategies. RESULTS: The percentage achieving SVR was 52.3% in the standard care strategy and 59.5% in the EGF strategy. Compared with standard care, the EGF strategy cost an incremental $36,568 per unadjusted life-year gained and $16,443 per quality-adjusted life-year gained. In a sensitivity analysis, if a third-party payer was willing to pay $50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year gained for the use of an EGF, then 86.1% of patients would be within the budget. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with standard care, adjunctive therapy with an EGF for the management of treatment-induced anemia may increase the probability of achieving SVR, increase unadjusted lifespan, and increase quality-adjusted lifespan at an acceptable cost.",2005-01-01655,16234051,Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol,Brennan M R Spiegel,2005,3 / 10,1034-42,No,16234051,"Brennan M R Spiegel; Kristina Chen; Chiun-Fang Chiou; Sean Robbins; Zobair M Younossi; Kristina Chen; Chiun-Fang Chiou; Sean Robbins; Zobair M Younossi; Erythropoietic growth factors for treatment-induced anemia in hepatitis C: a cost-effectiveness analysis, Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol, 2005-Oct; 3(10):1542-3565; 1034-42",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adjunctive therapy with erythropoietic growth factors for anemia vs. Ribavirin dose-reduction,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,16443,United States,2004,22528.48
3123,Is combined androgen blockade with bicalutamide cost-effective compared with combined androgen blockade with flutamide?,"OBJECTIVES: To determine the cost-effectiveness of combined androgen blockade (CAB) with bicalutamide versus CAB with flutamide in men with Stage D2 prostate cancer. Both bicalutamide and flutamide are commonly used in CAB for prostate cancer. Although the cost of bicalutamide is more than that of flutamide, it is important that the efficacy, quality of life, and side effects are also considered when determining whether CAB with bicalutamide is a cost-effective option. METHODS: A decision model was created to compare treatment strategies. Survival and side-effect information was based on a randomized trial that directly compared bicalutamide and flutamide. The costs and quality-of-life effects related to therapy were determined from published sources. RESULTS: The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained for bicalutamide versus flutamide was 22,000 dollars and 16,000 dollars at 5 and 10 years, respectively. If a quality adjustment was not included, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for CAB with bicalutamide compared with CAB with flutamide was even more favorable (20,000 dollars/life year gained at 5 years). One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness estimates were most sensitive to drug costs and survival (baseline survival was not significantly different between therapies). Multi-way uncertainty analysis revealed that the median value of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at 5 years was 13,637 dollars/quality-adjusted life year when all the parameters were varied over a clinically reasonable range.

3125,The cost-utility of photodynamic therapy in eyes with neovascular macular degeneration--a value-based reappraisal with 5-year data,"PURPOSE: To assess the value conferred by photodynamic therapy (PDT) and the cost-utility of PDT for the treatment of classic, subfoveal choroidal neovascularization associated with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). DESIGN: Average cost-utility analysis utilizing clinical trial data, patient-based time tradeoff utility preferences, and a third party insurer cost perspective. METHODS: Five-year visual acuity data from the TAP (Treatment of Age-related Macular Degeneration With Photodynamic Therapy) Investigation were modeled into a 12-year, value-based, reference case, cost-utility model utilizing year 2004 Medicare costs and an outcome of dollar/QALY (dollars/quality-adjusted life-year). Discounting of outcomes and costs using net present value analysis with a 3% annual rate was performed as recommended by the Panel for Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. RESULTS: PDT with verteporfin (Visudyne) dye for classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization confers an 8.1% quality of life (value) improvement over the 12-year life expectancy of the reference case, while during the last 8 years the value improvement is 9.5%. The average cost-utility of the intervention is dollar 31,103/QALY (quality-adjusted life-year). Extensive one-way sensitivity analysis values range from dollar 20,736/QALY if treatment efficacy is increased by 50% to dollar 62,207 if treatment efficacy is decreased by 50%, indicating robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: PDT using verteporfin dye to treat classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization is a very cost-effective treatment by conventional standards.

3126,Joint recovery programme versus usual care: an economic evaluation of a clinical pathway for joint replacement surgery,"OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to determine the incremental cost-effectiveness of a clinical pathway for patients undergoing joint replacement, the Joint Recovery Programme (JRP), as compared with usual care. The existing care process was revised to contain costs and shorten waiting lists by facilitating patient flows and improve healthcare efficiency. METHODS: The study design was a before-after trial. In total, 160 patients undergoing total hip and total knee replacement, aged 28 to 87 years (mean age, 64.4 years), were treated either according to the Joint Recovery Programme (a standardized care process with patient education and rehabilitation in groups) or usual care. Both groups were followed for 1 year. Costs were studied from a societal perspective. Outcomes included functional level (Harris Hip score and American Knee Society score) and generic quality of life (EuroQol). RESULTS: The results indicate that the Joint Recovery Programme resulted in a significant cost saving when compared with usual care mainly as a result of a considerable (>50%) reduction in length of hospital stay. The average cost saving per patient amounted to $1261 in the total hip replacement group and $3336 in the total knee replacement group. At the same time, both functional level and quality of life were higher in the JRP group.

3128,A dynamic population model of disease progression in COPD,"To contribute to evidence-based policy making, a dynamic Dutch population model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) progression was developed. The model projects incidence, prevalence, mortality, progression and costs of diagnosed COPD by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease-severity stage for 2000-2025, taking into account population dynamics and changes in smoking prevalence over time. It was estimated that of all diagnosed COPD patients in 2000, 27% had mild, 55% moderate, 15% severe and 3% very severe COPD. The severity distribution of COPD incidence was computed to be 40% mild, 55% moderate, 4% severe and 0.1% very severe COPD. Disease progression was modelled as decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) % predicted depending on sex, age, smoking and FEV1 % pred. The relative mortality risk of a 10-unit decrease in FEV1 % pred was estimated at 1.2. Projections of current practice were compared with projections assuming that each year 25% of all COPD patients receive either minimal smoking cessation counselling or intensive counselling plus bupropion. In the projections of current practice, prevalence rates between 2000-2025 changed from 5.1 to 11 per 1,000 inhabitants for mild, 11 to 14 per 1,000 for moderate, 3.0 to 3.9 per 1,000 for severe and from 0.5 to 1.3 per 1,000 for very severe COPD. Costs per inhabitant increased from 1.40 Euro to 3.10 for mild, 6.50 Euro to 9.00 for moderate, 6.20 Euro to 8.50 for severe and from 3.40 Euro to 9.40 for very severe COPD (price level 2000). Both smoking cessation scenarios were cost-effective with minimal counselling generating net savings. In conclusion, the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease progression model is a useful instrument to give detailed information about the future burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to assess the long-term impact of interventions on this burden.",2005-01-01686,16055869,Eur Respir J,M Hoogendoorn,2005,26 / 2,223-33,No,16055869,"M Hoogendoorn; M P M H Rutten-van Mölken; R T Hoogenveen; M L L van Genugten; A S Buist; E F M Wouters; T L Feenstra; A dynamic population model of disease progression in COPD, Eur Respir J, 2005-Aug; 26(2):0903-1936; 223-33",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Intensive counseling for smoking cessation plus bupropion vs. Minimal counseling alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,25 Years,4.00,4.00,29955.88,Euro,2000,41564.18

Whether such antibiotic prophylaxis is cost-effective is not clear. The authors' objective is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of predental antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with underlying heart disease. METHODS: The authors conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model to compare cost-effectiveness of 7 antibiotic regimens per AHA guidelines and a no prophylaxis strategy. The study population consisted of a hypothetical cohort of 10 million patients with either a high or moderate risk for developing endocarditis. RESULTS: Prophylaxis for patients with moderate or high risk for endocarditis cost $88,007/quality-adjusted life years saved if clarithromycin was used. Prophylaxis with amoxicillin and ampicillin resulted in a net loss of lives. All other regimens were less cost-effective than clarithromycin. For 10 million persons, clarithromycin prophylaxis prevented 119 endocarditis cases and saved 19 lives. CONCLUSION: Predental antibiotic prophylaxis is cost-effective only for persons with moderate or high risk of developing endocarditis. Contrary to current recommendations, our data demonstrate that amoxicillin and ampicillin are not cost-effective and should not be considered the agents of choice.

3142,Cost-effectiveness of dual-chamber pacing compared with ventricular pacing for sinus node dysfunction,"BACKGROUND: Compared with single-chamber ventricular pacing, dual-chamber pacing can reduce adverse events and, as a result, improve quality of life in patients paced for sick sinus syndrome. It is not clear, however, how these benefits compare with the increased cost of dual-chamber pacemakers. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used 4-year data from a 2010-patient, randomized trial to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of dual-chamber pacing compared with ventricular pacing and then projected these findings over the patients' lifetimes by using a Markov model that was calibrated to the first 5 years of in-trial data. To assess the stability of the findings, we performed 1000 bootstrap analyses and multiple sensitivity analyses. During the first 4 years of the trial, dual-chamber pacemakers increased quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.013 year per subject at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 53,000 dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained. Over a lifetime, dual-chamber pacing was projected to increase quality-adjusted life expectancy by 0.14 year with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately 6800 dollars per quality-adjusted year of life gained. In bootstrap analyses, dual-chamber pacing was cost-effective in 91.9% of simulations at a threshold of 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted year of life and in 93.2% of simulations at a threshold of 100,000 dollars. Its cost-effectiveness ratio was also below this threshold in numerous sensitivity analyses that varied key estimates.

3143,Cost-effectiveness analysis of thrombolytic treatment for stroke,"Thrombolysis is used to treat stroke patients based on the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke study and meta-analysis results. We present a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a probabilistic model of the use of thrombolytic therapy in stroke treatment.We surveyed patients who had had a stroke during their hospital stay and examined them again 1 year after release from the hospital to obtain data on costs and natural history. We then calculated utility weights using the European Quality of Life Questionnaire. When the model runs, 4,000 Monte Carlo simulations are undertaken in which each parameter value changes depending on its probability distribution. The results are expressed in terms of the cost-effectiveness plane and the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.We studied 435 patients, of whom 304 had had an ischemic stroke. One year later, 216 were still alive. The mean utility values were 0.22 for disabled patients and 0.77 for autonomous patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) obtained by means of the parameters was -19,000 EUR/quality-adjusted life year, reflecting a saving of 6,000 EUR and a health benefit for patients. The cost-effectiveness plane showed that thrombolysis was a dominant variable in 96.1% of simulations. In the acceptability curves, only 0.4 of simulations obtained an ICER higher than the societal threshold.Thrombolytic therapy seems to be a useful intervention because it is inexpensive and cost-effective.

3147,Cost-effectiveness projections of oxaliplatin and infusional fluorouracil versus irinotecan and bolus fluorouracil in first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal carcinoma,"The results of a randomized comparison study (N9741) showed that oxaliplatin and infusional fluorouracil (FU) (FOLFOX) was superior to the previous standard of care in the United States, irinotecan and bolus FU (IFL), as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic colon carcinoma. The trade-offs between costs and survival for these two regimens have not been explored.A post-hoc, incremental cost-effectiveness (ICE) projection using simulated cohorts of patients starting FOLFOX or IFL was tracked for major clinical events, toxicities, and survival. Recurrence and survival risks were based on clinical trial data. Resource use was projected using observed dose intensity, duration of therapy, delays in therapy, and toxicities Grade > 2 in N9741. The frequency, costs, and consequences of second-line therapy were examined. The time frame was 5 years, and the perspective was that of Medicare as a third-party payer.Initial treatment with FOLFOX versus IFL had an average incremental cost of dollars 29,523, a survival benefit of 4.4 months, and an ICE of dollars 80,410 per life year (LY), dollars 111,890 per quality-adjusted LY, and dollars 89,080 per progression-free year. By using the 95% confidence interval for the time to progression observed in N9741, the ICE associated with FOLFOX ranged from dollars 121,220 to dollars 59,250 per LY. In the clinical trial, dose delays and skipped doses were frequent. If progression-free patients were treated without delay for the first year or lifetime, then the ICE for FOLFOX increased to dollars 117,910 and dollars 222,200 per LY, respectively. The ICE increased to dollars 84,780 per LY when the model incorporated a revised IFL schedule with lower early toxicity and similar rates of treatment with second-line regimens.FOLFOX provided substantial benefits that incurred substantial additional costs.

3148,Cost-effectiveness of population screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency: a decision analysis,"The objective was to assess the cost-effectiveness of population screening for alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency. The design was a Markov-based decision analytic model. Hypothetical cohorts were analyzed from birth and followed over time until death using Monte Carlo simulation. The following strategies were compared: 1) screen all newborns, 2) screen all 10-year-old children, and 3) do not screen. Screenees found to have PI*ZZ AAT deficiency received the benefits of lower smoking rates and were offered augmentation therapy. In keeping with reported experience, most (96%) non-screened AAT deficient individuals remained undiagnosed and, therefore, missed these benefits. Under base conditions, screening all newborns cost nearly $422,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained; this estimate fell to $92,135 per QALY when the cost of screening was minimized to $6 in the model. Delaying screening until age 10 decreased the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to nearly $317,000. In sensitivity analysis, when the prevalence of PI*ZZ individuals increased from a baseline of 1.96 to 16 per 10,000, the ICER for newborn screening decreased below $100,000 per QALY. When the cost of screening and augmentation therapy were decreased simultaneously with increasing PI*ZZ prevalence, there were many scenarios in which the ICER decreased below $50,000.

The time horizon was set at 14 days based on the general duration of influenza infection in Japan. Clinical outcomes were mainly derived from reports and guidance published by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the UK. Japan-specific cost parameters incorporated into the decision model were taken from the Medical Fee Point Survey conducted at St Luke's International Hospital in accordance with medical fee receipts kept at our institution. The study included four professionals and a supporter who gathered information required for the analysis.In otherwise healthy adults, cost savings of yen831.6 (approximately $US6.72; 2002 values) in the oseltamivir group and an increment in cost of yen40.5 (approximately $US0.33) in the zanamivir group were achieved in comparison with the control group. In contrast, an incremental cost of yen288.4 (approximately $US2.33) was incurred in the oseltamivir group versus the control group when at-risk patients were assessed, but cost savings of yen159.8 (approximately $US1.29) were achieved in the zanamivir group. As a result of cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses in otherwise healthy adults, oseltamivir dominated the control therapy because cost savings in the oseltamivir group were made.

On the other hand, we suggest that zanamivir is the drug of choice for use in at-risk patients, and we recommend, in the light of our results, that if zanamivir is not available another therapy should be given rather than oseltamivir. Since with influenza infections deaths and hospitalisations of at-risk patients impact on the Japanese community, decision-making on the appropriate therapy should take into account the particular patient group involved.",2005-01-12489,17523746,Clin Drug Investig,Tadao Inoue,2005,25 / 1,49-63,Yes,17523746,"Tadao Inoue; Kazuhiro Watanabe; Naohiko Chonabayashi; Yoshio Uetsuka; Pharmacoeconomics of antiviral therapy for influenza in a Japanese hospital setting, Clin Drug Investig, ; 25(1):1173-2563; 49-63",QALY,Japan,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Zanamivir vs. Control therapy not active against influenza (e.g. antibiotics, antipyretics)",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,2 Weeks,Not Stated,Not Stated,-33222.45,Japan,2002,-382.41

This review evaluates the difference in cost and quality of life of six on-demand proton pump inhibitor maintenance strategies in patients with nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease. This was performed by decision analysis and Markov modeling of costs (from the perspective of the healthcare service and society) and utility up to 12 months. Median utility scores associated with each proton pump inhibitor ranged from 0.731 to 0.745 quality-adjusted life years and were not statistically different. Annual expected cost, however, was statistically different among the different drugs and the following cost-minimization ranking was obtained for median costs to the healthcare service and society, respectively: rabeprazole (euro 181, euro 295), pantoprazole (euro 223, euro 341), lansoprazole (euro 249, euro 370), omeprazole 10 mg (euro 297, euro 412), esomeprazole (euro 295, euro 419) and omeprazole 20 mg (euro 405, euro 528).

Fluvastatin is the lowest cost statin currently available (less than the price of generic statins).

3168,Cost-effectiveness of intensity-modulated radiation therapy,"Technical advances have given medicine the opportunity to refine current treatment techniques to improve outcomes. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and high energy linear accelerators are but a few examples of technology translating into clinical practice. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is a form of 3D conformal radiation that is being increasingly incorporated into the management of patients with prostate cancer. As with any new technology, the cost of intensity-modulated radiation therapy is considerably greater than standard therapy. Economic models can be useful to compare treatments when this comparison cannot be performed in a clinical trial. A Markov Model was used to compare the use of intensity-modulated radiation with 3D conformal radiation therapy in the treatment of a 70 year old man with a good- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Cost data for men with Medicare insurance and prostate cancer treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy and 3D conformal radiation therapy was obtained from the billing department at the Fox Chase Cancer Center (PA, USA). Utilities were collected from men undergoing intensity-modulated radiation therapy and 3D conformal radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was found to be cost effective in the treatment of a 70 year old man with prostate cancer with a incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of USD 16,182/quality-adjusted life year for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer and USD 17,448/ quality-adjusted life year for men with good-risk prostate cancer.

3170,The costs and benefits of deep brain stimulation surgery for patients with dystonia: an initial exploration,"Objectives. To perform a preliminary cost-utility and cost-benefit of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the treatment of dystonia, Materials and Methods. We conducted a prospective study of 26 patients undergoing DBS for the treatment of dystonia. We performed a cost-utility analysis using the Euroquol (EQ-5D) questionnaire. A cost-benefit analysis used the willingness-to-pay principle and costs of treatment were calculated retrospectively in order to calculate the cost-benefit. Results. We found that the EQ-5D score improved from 29 to 76.2 points after surgery, an incremental utility of 0.47. There was an overall gain of 0.94 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) with a cost of ?33,980 per QALY. Conclusions.

3174,Preventing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastrointestinal toxicity: are older strategies more cost-effective in the general population?,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the relative cost-effectiveness of five gastroprotective strategies for patients in the general population not judged to be at high gastrointestinal (GI) risk requiring regular traditional (t) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for over 3 weeks: tNSAID/H(2) receptor antagonists (H(2)RAs); tNSAID/proton pump inhibitors (PPIs); tNSAID/misoprostol; COX-2 preferential NSAIDs or COX-2-specific NSAIDs (COXIBs). METHODS: A systematic review of outcomes and UK cost data were combined in an incremental economic analysis. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were generated for quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: Cost-utility analysis showed a tNSAID with a H(2)RA is safer and less costly than tNSAIDs alone, and equally effective and less costly than COXIBs. tNSAID/misoprostol was also dominated by tNSAID/H(2)RA due to withdrawal caused by side-effects reducing overall health status. The incremental increase in QALYs gained by using COXIBs instead of tNSAID/H(2)RA would cost 670,000 pounds per QALY gained. The incremental increase in QALYs gained by using tNSAID/PPI instead of COXIBs would cost 26,000 pounds per QALY gained. If the decision-maker will pay up to 140,000 pounds per extra QALY, the optimal strategy is tNSAID/H(2)RA. If the decision-maker will pay over this the optimal strategy is tNSAID/PPI. CONCLUSION: The economic analysis suggests that there may be a case for prescribing H(2)RAs in all patients requiring NSAIDs.

3181,Comparing cost/utility of giving an aromatase inhibitor as monotherapy for 5 years versus sequential administration following 2-3 or 5 years of tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for postmenopausal breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown aromatase inhibitors administered as monotherapy or sequentially to tamoxifen to improve relapse-free survival in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer. Any difference in cost/utility between the strategies may be of importance to therapy selection. METHODS: Cost/utility was compared between the different regimens based on the theoretical assumption that costs, benefits and side-effects were similar for each drug and independent of whether it was administered as monotherapy or sequentially. RESULTS: Tamoxifen for 2-3 years followed by an aromatase inhibitor for 3 or 2 years provided the lowest cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALY) estimates, while administration of an aromatase inhibitor subsequent to 5 years on tamoxifen provided the highest values. The difference between strategies increased with patient age. Cost/QALY estimates were sensitive to an increase in hip fracture risk and to cost reductions due to relapse prevention.

3193,Cost-effectiveness of alternative blood-screening strategies for West Nile Virus in the United States,"BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the US, varying seasonally and by geographic region. WNV can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and mandatory screening of blood for WNV was recently introduced throughout the US. Guidelines for selecting cost-effective strategies for screening blood for WNV do not exist. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for screening blood for WNV using a computer-based mathematical model, and using data from prospective studies, retrospective studies, and published literature. For three geographic areas with varying WNV-transmission intensity and length of transmission season, the model was used to estimate lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios associated with alternative screening strategies in a target population of blood-transfusion recipients. We compared the status quo (baseline screening using a donor questionnaire) to several strategies which differed by nucleic acid testing of either pooled or individual samples, universal versus targeted screening of donations designated for immunocompromised patients, and seasonal versus year-long screening. In low-transmission areas with short WNV seasons, screening by questionnaire alone was the most cost-effective strategy. In areas with high levels of WNV transmission, seasonal screening of individual samples and restricting screening to blood donations designated for immunocompromised recipients was the most cost-effective strategy. Seasonal screening of the entire recipient pool added minimal clinical benefit, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding USD 1.7 million per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Year-round screening offered no additional benefit compared to seasonal screening in any of the transmission settings.

3196,Cost-effectiveness of alternative blood-screening strategies for West Nile Virus in the United States,"BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is endemic in the US, varying seasonally and by geographic region. WNV can be transmitted by blood transfusion, and mandatory screening of blood for WNV was recently introduced throughout the US. Guidelines for selecting cost-effective strategies for screening blood for WNV do not exist. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for screening blood for WNV using a computer-based mathematical model, and using data from prospective studies, retrospective studies, and published literature. For three geographic areas with varying WNV-transmission intensity and length of transmission season, the model was used to estimate lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios associated with alternative screening strategies in a target population of blood-transfusion recipients. We compared the status quo (baseline screening using a donor questionnaire) to several strategies which differed by nucleic acid testing of either pooled or individual samples, universal versus targeted screening of donations designated for immunocompromised patients, and seasonal versus year-long screening. In low-transmission areas with short WNV seasons, screening by questionnaire alone was the most cost-effective strategy. In areas with high levels of WNV transmission, seasonal screening of individual samples and restricting screening to blood donations designated for immunocompromised recipients was the most cost-effective strategy. Seasonal screening of the entire recipient pool added minimal clinical benefit, with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios exceeding USD 1.7 million per quality-adjusted life-year gained. Year-round screening offered no additional benefit compared to seasonal screening in any of the transmission settings.
