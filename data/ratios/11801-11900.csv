11801,C-QUALITY: cost and quality-of-life pharmacoeconomic analysis of antidepressants in major depressive disorder in Italy,"INTRODUCTION: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and disabling condition across the world. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are the most commonly used antidepressants. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness [euro per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)] of all SSRIs and all SNRIs for the treatment of MDD in Italy. METHODS: A decision analytic model was adapted from the Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits agency model to reflect current clinical practice in the treatment of MDD in the largest Italian regions. This adaptation was possible thanks to the collaboration of an expert panel of Italian psychiatrists and health economists. The model evaluated patients with a first diagnosis of MDD and initiating an SSRI or an SNRI for the first time. The time horizon was 12 months. Efficacy and utility data for the model were retrieved from the literature and validated by the expert panel. Local data were considered for resource utilization and for treatment costs based on each regional health service perspective. Population-weighted regional data were used to define a national model. Scenario simulations, one-way sensitivity analyses, and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to test the robustness of the model. RESULTS: The base case analysis showed that escitalopram was associated with a lower total cost (euro 1,562) and a larger health gain (QALYs) at 1 year (0.732) per patient and dominated the other treatment strategies since more QALYs were achieved at a lower total cost. Sensitivity analyses support the robustness of the model. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that escitalopram is the most cost-effective pharmacological treatment strategy for the Italian health service compared with other SSRIs and all SNRIs used in the first-line treatment of MDD.",2013-01-14163,23929174,Adv Ther,Claudio Mencacci,2013,30 / 7,697-712,No,23929174,"Claudio Mencacci; Eugenio Aguglia; Giovanni Biggio; Lodovico Cappellari; Guido Di Sciascio; Andrea Fagiolini; Giuseppe Maina; Alfonso Tortorella; Pablo Katz; Claudio Ripellino; C-QUALITY: cost and quality-of-life pharmacoeconomic analysis of antidepressants in major depressive disorder in Italy, Adv Ther, ; 30(7):0741-238X; 697-712",QALY,Italy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Fluvoxamine vs. Escitalopram,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-8734.29,Euro,2013,-12887.78

11806,The cost-effectiveness of temozolomide in the adjuvant treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this work was to determine the cost-effectiveness of temozolomide compared with that of radiotherapy alone in the adjuvant treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Temozolomide is the only chemotherapeutic agent to have demonstrated a significant survival benefit in a randomized clinical trial. Our analysis builds on earlier work by incorporating caregiver time costs and generic temozolomide availability. It is also the first analysis applicable to the US context. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to collect relevant data. Transition probabilities were calculated from randomized controlled trial data comparing temozolomide plus radiotherapy with radiotherapy alone. Direct costs were calculated from charges reported by the Mayo Clinic. Utilities were obtained from a previous cost-utility analysis. Using these data, a Markov model with a 1-month cycle length and 5-year time horizon was constructed. RESULTS: The addition of brand Temodar and generic temozolomide to the standard radiotherapy regimen was associated with base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $102 364 and $8875, respectively, per quality-adjusted life-year. The model was most sensitive to the progression-free survival associated with the use of only radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Both the brand and generic base-case estimates are cost-effective under a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150 000 per quality-adjusted life-year. All 1-way sensitivity analyses produced incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below this threshold. We conclude that both the brand Temodar and generic temozolomide are cost-effective treatments for newly diagnosed glioblastoma within the US context. However, assuming that the generic product produces equivalent quality of life and survival benefits, it would be significantly more cost-effective than the brand option.",2013-01-14173,23935155,Neuro-oncol,Andrew Messali,2013,15 / 11,1532-42,No,23935155,"Andrew Messali; Joel W Hay; Reginald Villacorta; The cost-effectiveness of temozolomide in the adjuvant treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma in the United States, Neuro-oncol, ; 15(11):1522-8517; 1532-42",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Temodar vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,5.00,102364,United States,2011,117778.28

11808,A cost-utility analysis of lung cancer screening and the additional benefits of incorporating smoking cessation interventions,"BACKGROUND: A 2011 report from the National Lung Screening Trial indicates that three annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screenings for lung cancer reduced lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest X-ray among older individuals at high risk for lung cancer. Discussion has shifted from clinical proof to financial feasibility. The goal of this study was to determine whether LDCT screening for lung cancer in a commercially-insured population (aged 50-64) at high risk for lung cancer is cost-effective and to quantify the additional benefits of incorporating smoking cessation interventions in a lung cancer screening program. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The current study builds upon a previous simulation model to estimate the cost-utility of annual, repeated LDCT screenings over 15 years in a high risk hypothetical cohort of 18 million adults between age 50 and 64 with 30+ pack-years of smoking history. In the base case, the lung cancer screening intervention cost $27.8 billion over 15 years and yielded 985,284 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained for a cost-utility ratio of $28,240 per QALY gained. Adding smoking cessation to these annual screenings resulted in increases in both the costs and QALYs saved, reflected in cost-utility ratios ranging from $16,198 per QALY gained to $23,185 per QALY gained. Annual LDCT lung cancer screening in this high risk population remained cost-effective across all sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that repeat annual lung cancer screening in a high risk cohort of adults aged 50-64 is highly cost-effective.

The StandBy Response Service is one such service operating in Australia for those bereaved through suicide. Few previous studies have reported estimates or evaluations of the economic impact and outcomes associated with the implementation of bereavement/grief interventions. AIMS: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of a postvention service from a societal perspective. METHOD: A Markov model was constructed to estimate the health outcomes, quality-adjusted life years, and associated costs such as medical costs and time off work. Data were obtained from a prospective cross-sectional study comparing previous clients of the StandBy service with a control group of people bereaved by suicide who had not had contact with StandBy. Costs and outcomes were measured at 1 year after suicide bereavement and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated. RESULTS: The base case found that the StandBy service dominated usual care with a cost saving from providing the StandBy service of AUS $803 and an increase in quality-adjusted life years of 0.02. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates there is an 81% chance the service would be cost-effective given a range of possible scenarios. CONCLUSION: Postvention services are a cost-effective strategy and may even be cost-saving if all costs to society from suicide are taken into account.",2013-01-14185,23942387,Crisis,Tracy Comans,2013,34 / 6,390-7,No,23942387,"Tracy Comans; Victoria Visser; Paul Scuffham; Cost effectiveness of a community-based crisis intervention program for people bereaved by suicide, Crisis, ; 34(6):0227-5910; 390-7",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,StandBy Response Service via a 24-hr crisis response telephone number vs. Standard/Usual Care,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,-40150,Australia,2011,-47731.6
11814,Cost-effectiveness of surgical decompression for space-occupying hemispheric infarction,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Surgical decompression reduces mortality and increases the probability of a favorable functional outcome after space-occupying hemispheric infarction. Its cost-effectiveness is uncertain. METHODS: We assessed clinical outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness for the first 3 years in patients who were randomized to surgical decompression or best medical treatment within 48 hours after symptom onset in the Hemicraniectomy After Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction With Life-Threatening Edema Trial (HAMLET). Data on medical consumption were derived from case record files, hospital charts, and general practitioners. We calculated costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Uncertainty was assessed with bootstrapping. A Markov model was constructed to estimate costs and health outcomes after 3 years. RESULTS: Of 39 patients enrolled within 48 hours, 21 were randomized to surgical decompression. After 3 years, 5 surgical (24%) and 14 medical patients (78%) had died. In the first 3 years after enrollment, operated patients had more QALYs than medically treated patients (mean difference, 1.0 QALY [95% confidence interval, 0.6-1.4]), but at higher costs (mean difference, euro127,000 [95% confidence interval, 73,100-181,000]), indicating incremental costs of euro127,000 per QALY gained. Ninety-eight percent of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios replicated by bootstrapping were >euro80,000 per QALY gained. Markov modeling suggested costs of approximately euro60,000 per QALY gained for a patient''s lifetime.

11815,Cost-effectiveness of HCV case-finding for people who inject drugs via dried blood spot testing in specialist addiction services and prisons,"OBJECTIVES: People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for acquiring hepatitis C virus (HCV), but many are unaware of their infection. HCV dried blood spot (DBS) testing increases case-finding in addiction services and prisons. We determine the cost-effectiveness of increasing HCV case-finding among PWID by offering DBS testing in specialist addiction services or prisons as compared to using venepuncture. DESIGN: Cost-utility analysis using a dynamic HCV transmission model among PWID, including: disease progression, diagnosis, treatment, injecting status, incarceration and addition services contact. SETTING UK INTERVENTION: DBS testing in specialist addiction services or prisons. Intervention impact was determined by a meta-analysis of primary data. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs (in UK pound, pound1=US$1.60) and utilities (quality-adjusted life years, QALYs) were attached to each state and the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) determined. Multivariate uncertainty and one-way sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For a pound20 000 per QALY gained willingness-to-pay threshold, DBS testing in addiction services is cost-effective (ICER of pound14 600 per QALY gained). Under the base-case assumption of no continuity of treatment/care when exiting/entering prison, DBS testing in prisons is not cost-effective (ICER of pound59 400 per QALY gained). Results are robust to changes in HCV prevalence; increasing PWID treatment rates to those for ex-PWID considerably reduces ICER ( pound4500 and pound30 000 per QALY gained for addiction services and prison, respectively). If continuity of care is >40%, the prison DBS ICER falls below pound20 000 per QALY gained.

11817,A cost-effectiveness analysis of retropubic midurethral sling versus transobturator midurethral sling for female stress urinary incontinence,"AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness (CE) of retropubic midurethral sling (RMS) versus transobturator midurethral sling (TMS) for the treatment of female stress urinary incontinence (SUI). METHODS: A Markov chain decision model was created to simulate treatment of SUI with RMS versus TMS. Costing data were obtained from the Medicare RBRVS. Data regarding the efficacy and complications associated with RMS versus TMS was compiled from a literature review of 21 randomized RCTs with a minimum of 12 months follow-up, as were corresponding utilities for different continence states. Deterministic and probabilistic estimates of cost-effectiveness (CE) for each procedure were calculated and compared, and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: In the base-case deterministic analysis, the efficacy of RMS was 6.275 versus 6.272 QALYs for TMS. QALYs represent a measure of disease burden accounting for both quantity and quality of life lived and are used to assess the monetary value of a medical intervention. The average cost for treatment with RMS however was higher at $9,579 versus $9,017 with TMS. TMS was therefore overall more cost-effective than RMS (CE = $1,438/QALY vs. $1,527/QALY). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that physician and sling characteristics such as device cost, surgeon fee, efficacy of treatment, operative time, and duration of hospitalization could all affect the relative CE of the therapies.

11819,Cost-effectiveness of percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with stable coronary artery disease and abnormal fractional flow reserve,"BACKGROUND: The Fractional Flow Reserve Versus Angiography for Multivessel Evaluation (FAME) 2 trial demonstrated a significant reduction in subsequent coronary revascularization among patients with stable angina and at least 1 coronary lesion with a fractional flow reserve </=0.80 who were randomized to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with best medical therapy. The economic and quality-of-life implications of PCI in the setting of an abnormal fractional flow reserve are unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We calculated the cost of the index hospitalization based on initial resource use and follow-up costs based on Medicare reimbursements. We assessed patient utility using the EQ-5D health survey with US weights at baseline and 1 month and projected quality-adjusted life-years assuming a linear decline over 3 years in the 1-month utility improvements. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio based on cumulative costs over 12 months. Initial costs were significantly higher for PCI in the setting of an abnormal fractional flow reserve than with medical therapy ($9927 versus $3900, P<0.001), but the $6027 difference narrowed over 1-year follow-up to $2883 (P<0.001), mostly because of the cost of subsequent revascularization procedures. Patient utility was improved more at 1 month with PCI than with medical therapy (0.054 versus 0.001 units, P<0.001). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of PCI was $36 000 per quality-adjusted life-year, which was robust in bootstrap replications and in sensitivity analyses.

We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using the 21-gene assay in conjunction with Adjuvant! Online, and of providing adjuvant chemotherapy conditional upon risk classification. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov decision model simulated risk classification, treatment, and the natural history of breast cancer in a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old women with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu-negative early breast cancer. Cost-effectiveness was considered from an Ontario public-payer perspective by deriving the lifetime incremental cost (2012 Canadian dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for each strategy, and the probability each strategy is cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY. RESULTS: The 21-gene assay has an incremental cost per QALY in patients at low, intermediate, or high Adjuvant Online! risk of $22,440 (probability cost-effective 78.46%), $2,526 (99.40%), or $1,111 (99.82%), respectively.

11825,Cost-effectiveness of the 21-gene assay for guiding adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in early breast cancer,"OBJECTIVES: Adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in early breast cancer are complex. The 21-gene assay can potentially aid such decisions, but costs US $4175 per patient. Adjuvant! Online is a freely available decision aid. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using the 21-gene assay in conjunction with Adjuvant! Online, and of providing adjuvant chemotherapy conditional upon risk classification. METHODS: A probabilistic Markov decision model simulated risk classification, treatment, and the natural history of breast cancer in a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old women with lymph node-negative, estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2/neu-negative early breast cancer. Cost-effectiveness was considered from an Ontario public-payer perspective by deriving the lifetime incremental cost (2012 Canadian dollars) per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) for each strategy, and the probability each strategy is cost-effective, assuming a willingness-to-pay of $50,000 per QALY. RESULTS: The 21-gene assay has an incremental cost per QALY in patients at low, intermediate, or high Adjuvant Online! risk of $22,440 (probability cost-effective 78.46%), $2,526 (99.40%), or $1,111 (99.82%), respectively.

11826,Gastroprotective strategies in chronic NSAID users: a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing single-tablet formulations with individual components,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of competing gastroprotective strategies, including single-tablet formulations, in the prevention of gastrointestinal (GI) complications in patients with chronic arthritis taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). METHODS: We performed a cost-utility analysis to compare eight gastroprotective strategies including NSAIDs, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine-2 receptor antagonists, misoprostol, and single-tablet formulations. We derived estimates for outcomes and costs from medical literature. The primary outcome was incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained. We performed sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of GI complications, compliance rates, and drug costs. RESULTS: For average-risk patients, NSAID + PPI cotherapy was most cost-effective. The NSAID/PPI single-tablet formulation became cost-effective only when its price decreased from euro0.78 to euro0.56 per tablet, or when PPI compliance fell below 51% in the NSAID + PPI strategy. All other strategies were more costly and less effective. The model was highly sensitive to the GI complication risk, costs of PPI and NSAID/PPI single-tablet formulation, and compliance to PPI. In patients with a threefold higher risk of GI complications, both NSAID + PPI cotherapy and single-tablet formulation were cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: NSAID + PPI cotherapy is the most cost-effective strategy in all patients with chronic arthritis irrespective of their risk for GI complications.

11827,The value of high adherence to tamoxifen in women with breast cancer: a community-based cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Low adherence to adjuvant tamoxifen is associated with worse health outcomes but little is known about the cost-effectiveness of high adherence. METHODS: We conducted an economic evaluation using data for all women with incident breast cancer between 1993 and 2000 who were subsequently prescribed tamoxifen in the Tayside region of Scotland. Patient-level, lifetime Markov models evaluated the impact of high vs low adherence to tamoxifen using linked prescribing, cancer registry, clinical cancer audit, hospital discharge and death records. Direct medical costs were estimated for each patient and quality-of-life weights were assigned. Recurrence information was collected by case note review and adherence calculated from prescribing records with low adherence classed below 80%. RESULTS: A total of 354 (28%) patients had a recorded recurrence and 504 (39%) died. Four hundred and seventy-five (38%) patients had low adherence over the treatment period, which was associated with reduced time to recurrence of 52% (P<0.001). Time to other cause mortality was also reduced by 23% (P=0.055) but this was not statistically significant. For an average patient over her lifetime, low adherence was associated with a loss of 1.43 (95% CI: 1.15-1.71) discounted life years or 1.12 (95% CI: 0.91-1.34) discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and increased discounted medical costs of pound5970 (95% CI: pound4644- pound7372). Assuming a willingness to pay threshold of pound25,000 per QALY, the expected value of changing a patient from low to high adherence is pound33,897 (95% CI: pound28,322- pound39,652). CONCLUSION: Patients with low adherence have shorter time to recurrence, increased medical costs and worse quality of life.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective, cluster-randomized, controlled trial involved 13 hospitals (clusters) in the Netherlands and 506 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized to patient-centered (n=237) or usual care (controls) (n=269). Primary outcomes were change in HbA1c and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs); costs and incremental costs (USD) after 1 year were secondary outcomes. We applied nonparametric bootstrapping and probabilistic modeling over a lifetime using a validated Dutch model. The baseline HbA1c strata were <7.0% (53 mmol/mol), 7.0-8.5%, and >8.5% (69 mmol/mol). RESULTS: Patient-centered care was most effective and cost-effective in those with baseline HbA1c>8.5% (69 mmol/mol).

11830,Cost-effectiveness of an aprepitant regimen for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in patients with breast cancer in the UK,"PURPOSE: Prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remains an important goal for patients receiving chemotherapy. The objective of this study was to define, from the UK payer perspective, the cost-effectiveness of an antiemetic regimen using aprepitant, a selective neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist, for patients receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to compare an aprepitant regimen (aprepitant, ondansetron, and dexamethasone) with a standard UK antiemetic regimen (ondansetron, dexamethasone, and metoclopramide) for expected costs and health outcomes after single-day adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. The model was populated with results from patients with breast cancer participating in a randomized trial of CINV preventative therapy for cycle 1 of single-day chemotherapy. RESULTS: During 5 days after chemotherapy, 64% of patients receiving the aprepitant regimen and 47% of those receiving the UK comparator regimen had a complete response to antiemetic therapy (no emesis and no rescue antiemetic therapy). A mean of pound37.11 (78%) of the cost of aprepitant was offset by reduced health care resource utilization costs. The predicted gain in quality-adjusted lifeyears (QALYs) with the aprepitant regimen was 0.0048. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) with aprepitant, relative to the UK comparator, was pound10,847/QALY, which is well below the threshold commonly accepted in the UK of pound20,000- pound30,000/QALY.

11831,Cost-effectiveness of a community pharmacist intervention in patients with depression: a randomized controlled trial (PRODEFAR Study),"BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to antidepressants generates higher costs for the treatment of depression. Little is known about the cost-effectiveness of pharmacist''s interventions aimed at improving adherence to antidepressants. The study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a community pharmacist intervention in comparison with usual care in depressed patients initiating treatment with antidepressants in primary care. METHODS: Patients were recruited by general practitioners and randomized to community pharmacist intervention (87) that received an educational intervention and usual care (92). Adherence to antidepressants, clinical symptoms, Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs), use of healthcare services and productivity losses were measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between groups in costs or effects. From a societal perspective, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the community pharmacist intervention compared with usual care was euro1,866 for extra adherent patient and euro9,872 per extra QALY. In terms of remission of depressive symptoms, the usual care dominated the community pharmacist intervention. If willingness to pay (WTP) is euro30,000 per extra adherent patient, remission of symptoms or QALYs, the probability of the community pharmacist intervention being cost-effective was 0.71, 0.46 and 0.75, respectively (societal perspective). From a healthcare perspective, the probability of the community pharmacist intervention being cost-effective in terms of adherence, QALYs and remission was of 0.71, 0.76 and 0.46, respectively, if WTP is euro30,000. CONCLUSION: A brief community pharmacist intervention addressed to depressed patients initiating antidepressant treatment showed a probability of being cost-effective of 0.71 and 0.75 in terms of improvement of adherence and QALYs, respectively, when compared to usual care. Regular implementation of the community pharmacist intervention is not recommended.

11832,Cost-effectiveness of transabdominal ultrasound for cervical length screening for preterm birth prevention,"OBJECTIVE: Transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) cervical length (CL) screening has been proposed as an alternative to universal transvaginal screening to identify women at an increased risk of preterm birth. We sought to identify whether and under what circumstances TAUS would be cost-effective. STUDY DESIGN: This is a decision analytic model designed to compare an initial TAUS CL screening approach with universal transvaginal screening in a hypothetical cohort of women with a singleton pregnancy. Cost, probability, and utility estimates were derived from the existing literature. RESULTS: Under baseline assumptions, universal transvaginal was the dominant strategy. In comparison to TAUS, universal transvaginal CL screening reduced preterm birth by 0.03%, reduced costs by $1.2 million and increased quality-adjusted life years by 70 per 100,000 women. Although robust to many changes in many estimates, the model was sensitive to the cost of a transvaginal ultrasound, the prevalence of a short cervix and the test characteristics (ie, sensitivity and specificity) of a TAUS screening examination for short CL. CONCLUSION: Compared with an initial TAUS screen, universal transvaginal ultrasound was a more cost-effective strategy under most assumptions.

METHODS: A Markov model, simulating the natural history of female BC sufferers in Brazil, was developed. This model compares the lifetime effects, costs, and cost-effectiveness of seven BC screening strategies in women between 40 to 49 years: (A) usual care; (B) annual screen-film mammography (SFM); (C) SFM every 2 years; (D) annual full-field digital mammography (FFDM); (E) FFDM every 2 years; and (F and G) age-targeted options, with FFDM annually until 49 years and SFM annually (or biannually) from 50 to 69 years. RESULTS: Adopting SFM every 2 years (Strategy C) was found to be slightly more costly but also more effective in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of R$ 1,509 per QALY gained. Annual SFM (Strategy B) was the next best option at an additional R$ 13,131 per QALY gained. FFDM annual screening (Strategy E) was dominated by Strategy F, the age-targeted option.

11836,A cost-utility analysis comparing the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous and staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty,"BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of simultaneous or staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty have long been debated among orthopaedic surgeons. Advocates for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty posit that the benefits of decreased costs and recovery time, with no difference in functional outcomes, outweigh the economic costs of potential complications. The purpose of the study was to conduct a cost-utility analysis comparing simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty with staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. METHODS: A Markov model was designed to compare the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty with that of staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. Nationwide Inpatient Sample data sets from 2004 to 2007 were used to identify 24,574 simultaneous and 382,496 unilateral procedures. On the basis of the codes of the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, perioperative complications were categorized as minor, major, and mortality, and respective probability values were calculated. Nationwide Inpatient Sample data were used to determine hospital costs conditional on procedure type and complications. Rehabilitation costs, anesthesia costs, and heath utilities were estimated from the literature. To minimize selection bias, propensity score matching was used to match the groups on comorbid conditions, socioeconomic variables, and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: Using the matched sample, all complication rates were higher for the staged group. The estimated mean cost (in 2012 U.S. dollars) was $43,401 for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty compared with $72,233 for staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. The quality-adjusted life years gained were 9.31 for simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty and 9.29 for staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty. On the basis of these matched results, simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty dominated staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty with lower costs and better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of this analysis, simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty is more cost-effective than staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty, with lower costs and better outcomes for the average patient. These data can inform shared medical decision-making when bilateral total knee arthroplasty is indicated.",2013-01-14222,23965693,J Bone Joint Surg Am,Susan M Odum,2013,95 / 16,1441-9,No,23965693,"Susan M Odum; Jennifer L Troyer; Michael P Kelly; Russell D Dedini; Kevin J Bozic; A cost-utility analysis comparing the cost-effectiveness of simultaneous and staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty, J Bone Joint Surg Am, ; 95(16):0021-9355; 1441-9",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Simultaneous bilateral total knee arthroplasty vs. staged bilateral total knee arthroplasty,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,-1601777.88,United States,2012,-1805612.23

11849,The cost-effectiveness of diagnostic management strategies for children with minor head injury,"AIM: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic management strategies for children with minor head injury and identify an optimal strategy. METHODS: A probabilistic decision analysis model was developed to estimate the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued by each of six potential management strategies for minor head injury, including a theoretical ''zero option'' strategy of discharging all patients home without investigation. The model took a lifetime horizon and the perspective of the National Health Service. RESULTS: The optimal strategy was based on the Children''s Head injury Algorithm for the prediction of Important Clinical Events (CHALICE) rule, although the costs and outcomes associated with each strategy were broadly similar. CONCLUSIONS: Liberal use of CT scanning based on a high sensitivity decision rule is not only effective but also cost saving, with the CHALICE rule being the optimal strategy, although there is some uncertainty in the results. Incremental changes in the costs and QALYs are very small when all selective CT strategies are compared. The estimated cost of caring for patients with brain injury worsened by delayed treatment is very high compared with the cost of CT scanning. This analysis suggests that all hospitals receiving children with minor head injury should have unrestricted access to CT scanning for use in conjunction with evidence-based guidelines.",2013-01-14229,23968775,Arch Dis Child,M W Holmes,2013,98 / 12,939-44,No,23968775,"M W Holmes; S Goodacre; M D Stevenson; A Pandor; A Pickering; The cost-effectiveness of diagnostic management strategies for children with minor head injury, Arch Dis Child, ; 98(12):1468-2044; 939-44",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Diagnostic management strategy based on Children’s Head injury Algorithm for the prediction of important clinical events (CHALICE) vs. Discharge all,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,Not Stated,United Kingdom,2011,Not Stated

METHODS: The guideline consisted of a company-environment scan and up to five individual sessions with an OP. Sixteen OPs randomized to the guideline (n = 7) or usual care group (n = 9) recruited 275 and 249 employees. Costs were collected by using 3-monthly retrospective questionnaires. Quality-adjusted life-years gained were determined with 6-monthly administered EuroQol-5D. Waist circumference and body weight were measured at baseline and 18 months. RESULTS: Unfavorable differences were found on waist circumference (+1.6 cm; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 2.90) and weight (+1.1 kg; 95% CI, 0.01 to 2.15). Probabilities of cost-effectiveness were consistently less than 55%. Net employer loss was &OV0556;-158 (95% CI, -2865 to 2672).

11851,Cost effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of schizophrenia in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with antipsychotic medication is an important element of relapse prevention in the management of schizophrenia, and can reduce inpatient stays. Recently, the long-acting atypical antipsychotic paliperidone long-acting injectable (PLAI), a once-monthly LAI antipsychotic, was approved for treatment of schizophrenia in Germany. OBJECTIVE: To estimate, based on a previously published model, the cost effectiveness of PLAI compared with other common antipsychotic treatment strategies in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in Germany. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was adapted to the German healthcare system. The model considers the cost effectiveness for PLAI as a maintenance treatment for patients with schizophrenia from the payer perspective. The patients transition between eight health states on a monthly basis over a 5-year time horizon. As therapeutic strategies, PLAI, quetiapine, risperidone long-acting injections (RLAI), oral olanzapine, oral risperidone, zuclopenthixol decanoate, olanzapine long-acting injections (OLAI), oral typical and oral atypical were compared. Probability of relapse, level of adherence, side effects and treatment discontinuation were derived from the Swedish original model. Input factors regarding resource use and costs were estimated and adjusted for the German healthcare system. A probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) using cost-effectiveness scatter plots was performed to visualize the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In base-case scenario, PLAI is superior to RLAI in gained quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and avoided relapses. Relative to all other treatment strategies, PLAI is more effective with regard to gained QALYs and avoided relapses but results in higher treatment costs over a 5-year horizon in base-case scenario. The results were tested in PSA. If a cost-effectiveness threshold of <euro>30,000 is assumed, for example, PLAI can be considered to be cost effective compared with RLAI in about 92.5 % of cases regarding gained QALYs, and in 78.6 % of cases regarding avoided relapse. Compared with OLAI, in about 94.4 % of cases regarding gained QALYs and in 99.9 % of cases regarding avoided relapse, cost effectiveness can be considered. Comparing PLAI and zuclopenthixol decanoate, cost effectiveness can be assumed in about 90.4 % of cases regarding gained QALYs, and in all cases regarding avoided relapse.

11858,Cost effectiveness of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of schizophrenia in Germany,"BACKGROUND: Treatment with antipsychotic medication is an important element of relapse prevention in the management of schizophrenia, and can reduce inpatient stays. Recently, the long-acting atypical antipsychotic paliperidone long-acting injectable (PLAI), a once-monthly LAI antipsychotic, was approved for treatment of schizophrenia in Germany. OBJECTIVE: To estimate, based on a previously published model, the cost effectiveness of PLAI compared with other common antipsychotic treatment strategies in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in Germany. METHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was adapted to the German healthcare system. The model considers the cost effectiveness for PLAI as a maintenance treatment for patients with schizophrenia from the payer perspective. The patients transition between eight health states on a monthly basis over a 5-year time horizon. As therapeutic strategies, PLAI, quetiapine, risperidone long-acting injections (RLAI), oral olanzapine, oral risperidone, zuclopenthixol decanoate, olanzapine long-acting injections (OLAI), oral typical and oral atypical were compared. Probability of relapse, level of adherence, side effects and treatment discontinuation were derived from the Swedish original model. Input factors regarding resource use and costs were estimated and adjusted for the German healthcare system. A probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSA) using cost-effectiveness scatter plots was performed to visualize the robustness of the results. RESULTS: In base-case scenario, PLAI is superior to RLAI in gained quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and avoided relapses. Relative to all other treatment strategies, PLAI is more effective with regard to gained QALYs and avoided relapses but results in higher treatment costs over a 5-year horizon in base-case scenario. The results were tested in PSA. If a cost-effectiveness threshold of <euro>30,000 is assumed, for example, PLAI can be considered to be cost effective compared with RLAI in about 92.5 % of cases regarding gained QALYs, and in 78.6 % of cases regarding avoided relapse.

Given the recent head-to-head clinical trial study of ustekinumab and etanercept, an economic model comparing the two treatments can be constructed. Etanercept and ustekinumab are indicated for the treatment of chronic moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy. OBJECTIVE: Clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of ustekinumab, an anti-cytokine biologic, for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. This study evaluated the cost effectiveness of ustekinumab compared with etanercept from a US societal perspective. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained every 12 weeks over a base-case 3-year time horizon. A hypothetical patient cohort was based on the characteristics of the phase III Active Comparator Psoriasis Trial (ACCEPT). The main outcome measures were costs and QALYs, which were estimated from the US societal perspective. Costs, utilities, treatment strategy, and resource use estimates were obtained from relevant literature. All costs were adjusted to 2011 US dollars. A 3 % annual discount rate was applied to costs and QALYs. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were in US dollars per QALY gained. RESULTS: For the base-case 3-year time horizon, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio comparing ustekinumab 90 mg with etanercept 50 mg was US$384,401 per QALY gained. Ustekinumab 45 mg dominates etanercept 50 mg for the same time horizon. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses involving treatment strategy, transition probabilities, valuing outcomes, and resource use and costs. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests ustekinumab 90 mg has a minimal (4 %) chance of being cost effective compared with etanercept 50 mg at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$150,000 per QALY improvement. For the same threshold, ustekinumab 45 mg has a high (88 %) chance of being cost effective compared with etanercept 50 mg. CONCLUSION: Under typical US willingness-to-pay cutoffs, ustekinumab 90 mg is not cost effective compared with etanercept 50 mg therapy in moderate to severe psoriasis patients for the base-case 3-year time horizon.

11861,The outcome and cost-effectiveness of nurse-led care in people with rheumatoid arthritis: a multicentre randomised controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of nurse-led care (NLC) for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: In a multicentre pragmatic randomised controlled trial, the assessment of clinical effects followed a non-inferiority design, while patient satisfaction and cost assessments followed a superiority design. Participants were 181 adults with RA randomly assigned to either NLC or rheumatologist-led care (RLC), both arms carrying out their normal practice. The primary outcome was the disease activity score (DAS28) assessed at baseline, weeks 13, 26, 39 and 52; the non-inferiority margin being DAS28 change of 0.6. Mean differences between the groups were estimated controlling for covariates following per-protocol (PP) and intention-to-treat (ITT) strategies. The economic evaluation (NHS and healthcare perspectives) estimated cost relative to change in DAS28 and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) derived from EQ5D. RESULTS: Demographics and baseline characteristics of patients under NLC (n=91) were comparable to those under RLC (n=90). Overall baseline-adjusted difference in DAS28 mean change (95% CI) for RLC minus NLC was -0.31 (-0.63 to 0.02) for PP and -0.15 (-0.45 to 0.14) for ITT analyses. Mean difference in healthcare cost (RLC minus NLC) was pound710 (- pound352, pound1773) and - pound128 (- pound1263, pound1006) for PP and ITT analyses, respectively. NLC was more cost-effective with respect to cost and DAS28, but not in relation to QALY utility scores. In all secondary outcomes, significance was met for non-inferiority of NLC. NLC had higher ''general satisfaction'' scores than RLC in week 26. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide robust evidence to support non-inferiority of NLC in the management of RA.

11862,Modelling the efficiency of local versus central provision of intravenous thrombolysis after acute ischemic stroke,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prehospital redirection of stroke patients to a regional center is used as a strategy to maximize the provision of intravenous thrombolysis. We developed a model to quantify the benefit of redirection away from local services that were already providing thrombolysis. METHODS: A microsimulation using hospital and ambulance data from consecutive emergency admissions to 10 local acute stroke units estimated the effect of redirection to 2 regional neuroscience centers. Modeled outcomes reflected additional journey time and accuracy of stroke identification in the prehospital phase, and the relative efficiency of patient selection and door-needle time for each local site compared with the nearest regional neuroscience center. RESULTS: Thrombolysis was received by 223/1884 emergency admissions. Based on observed site performance, 68 additional patients would have been treated after theoretical redirection of 1269 true positive cases and 363 stroke mimics to the neuroscience center. Over 5 years redirection of this cohort generated 12.6 quality-adjusted life years at a marginal cost of pound6730 ($10,320, euro8347). The average additional cost of a quality-adjusted life year gain was pound534 ($819, euro673).

11863,Heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness of lifestyle counseling for metabolic syndrome risk groups -primary care patients in Sweden,"BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have indicated that lifestyle interventions for patients with lifestyle-related cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors (the metabolic syndrome) are cost-effective. However, patient characteristics in primary care practice vary considerably, i.e. they exhibit heterogeneity in risk factors. The cost-effectiveness of lifestyle interventions is likely to differ over heterogeneous patient groups. METHODS: Patients (62 men, 80 women) in the Kalmar Metabolic Syndrome Program (KMSP) in primary care (Kalmar regional healthcare area, Sweden) were divided into three groups reflecting different profiles of metabolic risk factors (low, middle and high risk) and gender. A Markov model was used to predict future cardiovascular disease and diabetes, including complications (until age 85 years or death), with health effects measured as QALYs and costs from a societal perspective in Euro (EUR) 2012, discounted 3%. Simulations with risk factor levels at start and at 12 months follow-up were performed for each group, with an assumed 4-year sustainability of intervention effects. RESULTS: The program was estimated cost-saving for middle and high risk men, while the incremental cost vs. do-nothing varied between EUR 3,500 - 18,000 per QALY for other groups. There is heterogeneity in the cost-effectiveness over the risk groups but this does not affect the overall conclusion on the cost-effectiveness of the KMSP. Even the highest ICER (for high risk women) is considered moderately cost-effective in Sweden. The base case result was not sensitive to alternative data and methodology but considerably affected by sustainability assumptions. Alternative risk stratifications did not change the overall conclusion that KMSP is cost-effective. However, simple grouping with average risk factor levels over gender groups overestimate the cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Lifestyle counseling to prevent metabolic diseases is cost-effective in Swedish standard primary care settings. The use of risk stratification in the cost-effectiveness analysis established that the program was cost-effective for all patient groups, even for those with very high levels of lifestyle-related risk factors for the metabolic syndrome diseases.

The use of risk stratification in the cost-effectiveness analysis established that the program was cost-effective for all patient groups, even for those with very high levels of lifestyle-related risk factors for the metabolic syndrome diseases.

11869,"Is community treatment best? a randomised trial comparing delivery of cancer treatment in the hospital, home and GP surgery","BACKGROUND: Care closer to home is being explored as a means of improving patient experience as well as efficiency in terms of cost savings. Evidence that community cancer services improve care quality and/or generate cost savings is currently limited. A randomised study was undertaken to compare delivery of cancer treatment in the hospital with two different community settings. METHODS: Ninety-seven patients being offered outpatient-based cancer treatment were randomised to treatment delivered in a hospital day unit, at the patient''s home or in local general practice (GP) surgeries. The primary outcome was patient-perceived benefits, using the emotional function domain of the EORTC quality of life (QOL) QLQC30 questionnaire evaluated after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included additional QOL measures, patient satisfaction, safety and health economics. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant QOL difference between treatment in the combined community locations relative to hospital (difference of -7.2, 95% confidence interval: -19.5 to +5.2, P=0.25). There was a significant difference between the two community locations in favour of home (+15.2, 1.3 to 29.1, P=0.033). Hospital anxiety and depression scale scores were consistent with the primary outcome measure. There was no evidence that community treatment compromised patient safety and no significant difference between treatment arms in terms of overall costs or Quality Adjusted Life Year. Seventy-eight percent of patients expressed satisfaction with their treatment whatever their location, whereas 57% of patients preferred future treatment to continue at the hospital, 81% at GP surgeries and 90% at home. Although initial pre-trial interviews revealed concerns among health-care professionals and some patients regarding community treatment, opinions were largely more favourable in post-trial interviews.

11871,Telemonitoring and self-management in the control of hypertension (TASMINH2): a cost-effectiveness analysis,"AIMS: Self-monitoring and self-titration of antihypertensives (self-management) is a novel intervention which improves blood pressure control. However, little evidence exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of self-monitoring of blood pressure in general and self-management in particular. This study aimed to evaluate whether self-management of hypertension was cost-effective. DESIGN AND METHODS: A cohort Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis was undertaken extrapolating to up to 35 years from cost and outcome data collected from the telemonitoring and self-management in hypertension trial (TASMINH2). Self-management of hypertension was compared with usual care in terms of lifetime costs, quality adjusted life years and cost-effectiveness using a UK Health Service perspective. Sensitivity analyses examined the effect of different time horizons and reduced effectiveness over time from self-management. RESULTS: In the long-term, when compared with usual care, self-management was more effective by 0.24 and 0.12 quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient for men and women, respectively. The resultant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for self-management was pound1624 per QALY for men and pound4923 per QALY for women. There was at least a 99% chance of the intervention being cost-effective for both sexes at a willingness to pay threshold of pound20,000 per QALY gained. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses around the assumptions made, provided that the effects of self-management lasted at least two years for men and five years for women.

11873,Prospective cost-effectiveness analysis of genomic profiling in breast cancer,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of the 70-gene signature (70-GS) (MammaPrint(R)) has earlier been estimated using retrospective validation data. Based on the prospective 5-year survival data of the microarRAy-prognoSTics-in-breast-cancER (RASTER) study, the aim here was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness reflecting the actual use in clinical practice, including reality-based compliance rates. METHODS: Costs and outcomes (quality-adjusted-life-years (QALYs)) were calculated in node-negative (N-) patients included in the RASTER study (n=427). Sensitivity and specificity of the 70-gene and Adjuvant! Online (AO) were based on 5-year distant-disease-free survival (DDFS). Subgroup analyses were performed for two groups for whom benefit of the 70-gene had earlier been reported: (1) ductal, oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+), tumour diameter 10-30 mm, grade II, age 40-70; (2) ductal, oestrogen receptor-positive, tumour diameter 5-30 mm, grade II/III and age 40-70. RESULTS: Based on 5-year survival data, the cost-effectiveness of the 70-gene signature versus AO was prospectively confirmed. The total health care costs per patient were euro26,786 for the 70-gene and euro29,187 for AO. The quality adjusted life years yielded 12.49 and 11.88, respectively. The subgroups retrieved slightly higher life gains and higher costs, but all resulted finally in a favourable position for the 70-gene signature.

11874,Cost-effectiveness of alternative treatments for depression in low-income women,"BACKGROUND: Low-income mothers are more likely to experience depressive symptoms than their higher income counterparts, but they are less likely to receive treatment. One way to overcome common barriers to care for low-income women is to do therapy in the mother''s home. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of in-home interpersonal therapy (IPT) to two standard therapies for depression treatment: office based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychotropic medication. METHODS: This cost utility analysis used a Markov model with a 3-year time horizon to compare the cost-effectiveness of the alternate therapies from the public payer perspective. We followed a hypothetical cohort of 1,000 women age 19 to 35 years with depressive symptoms who had an income level at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Costs were based on the number of women who completed the therapy. We used data from published literature on clinical trials with low-income minority women to determine the completion rates, duration, and effectiveness of each type of therapy. Additionally, costs for in-home IPT were calculated from unpublished trial data. Costs were determined using 2011 North Carolina Medicaid reimbursement rates; utility weights were taken from published literature. The endpoint was the total outpatient medical cost (therapy and outpatient medical visits). The study outcomes were depression free days (DFD), which were translated into quality of adjusted life years (QALY). We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of each therapy based on the number of QALYs gained. We conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses to determine how robust the results were to uncertainty in the parameters. RESULTS: Treating patients with IPT resulted in an ICER of USD 13,479/QALY and USD 29,309/QALY as compared to CBT and medications, respectively. The results were most sensitive to the efficacy of IPT. Simulations showed that, with a threshold of USD 50,000/QALY, IPT was cost-effective 95% and 78% of the time as compared to CBT and medications, respectively. If policy makers were willing to pay USD 50,000 per QALY, IPT had a 0.586 probability of being the cost-effective option relative to medication and in-office CBT. DISCUSSION: Due to higher completion rates, in-home IPT cost more but resulted in more QALYs gained than the other therapies. Our results indicated that in-home IPT was cost-effective as compared to office-based CBT and at least as cost-effective as medication therapy. The analysis was based on limited data because there have been few randomized, controlled studies on treatments for depression in low-income women, however; additional studies are needed to improve the accuracy of the model. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICY: In coming years, the number of low-income women covered by public insurance should increase due to the Affordable Care Act. Given the high prevalence of depression in this population, it will be important to consider the value of potential resources spent on depression treatments.

A new scenario of therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection is being established with the approval of two effective HCV protease inhibitors (PIs) in combination with the standard of care (SOC), peginterferon and ribavirin. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of combination therapy with new PIs (boceprevir and telaprevir) plus peginterferon and ribavirin versus SOC in treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 according to data obtained from clinical trials (CTs). METHODS: A Markov model simulating chronic HCV progression was used to estimate disease treatment costs and effects over patients'' lifetimes, in the Spanish national public healthcare system. The target population was treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, demographic characteristics for whom were obtained from the published pivotal CTs SPRINT and ADVANCE. Three options were analysed for each PI based on results from the two CTs: universal triple therapy, interleukin (IL)-28B-guided therapy and dual therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin. A univariate sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the uncertainty of certain parameters: age at start of treatment, transition probabilities, drug costs, CT efficacy results and a higher hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for patients with chronic HCV. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also carried out. RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of euro2012 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were used as outcome measures. According to the base-case analysis, using dual therapy as the comparator, the alternative IL28B-guided therapy presents a more favorable ICER (euro18,079/QALY for boceprevir and euro25,914/QALY for telaprevir) than the universal triple therapy option (euro27,594/QALY for boceprevir and euro33,751/QALY for telaprevir), with an ICER clearly below the efficiency threshold for medical interventions in the Spanish setting. Sensitivity analysis showed that age at the beginning of treatment was an important factor that influenced the ICER.

11879,Cost-effectiveness analysis of triple therapy with protease inhibitors in treatment-naive hepatitis C patients,"BACKGROUND: Chronic hepatitis C is the leading cause of chronic liver disease, representing a significant burden in terms of morbidity, mortality and costs. A new scenario of therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection is being established with the approval of two effective HCV protease inhibitors (PIs) in combination with the standard of care (SOC), peginterferon and ribavirin. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to estimate the cost effectiveness of combination therapy with new PIs (boceprevir and telaprevir) plus peginterferon and ribavirin versus SOC in treatment-naive patients with HCV genotype 1 according to data obtained from clinical trials (CTs). METHODS: A Markov model simulating chronic HCV progression was used to estimate disease treatment costs and effects over patients'' lifetimes, in the Spanish national public healthcare system. The target population was treatment-naive patients with chronic HCV genotype 1, demographic characteristics for whom were obtained from the published pivotal CTs SPRINT and ADVANCE. Three options were analysed for each PI based on results from the two CTs: universal triple therapy, interleukin (IL)-28B-guided therapy and dual therapy with peginterferon and ribavirin. A univariate sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the uncertainty of certain parameters: age at start of treatment, transition probabilities, drug costs, CT efficacy results and a higher hazard ratio for all-cause mortality for patients with chronic HCV. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses were also carried out. RESULTS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of euro2012 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained were used as outcome measures. According to the base-case analysis, using dual therapy as the comparator, the alternative IL28B-guided therapy presents a more favorable ICER (euro18,079/QALY for boceprevir and euro25,914/QALY for telaprevir) than the universal triple therapy option (euro27,594/QALY for boceprevir and euro33,751/QALY for telaprevir), with an ICER clearly below the efficiency threshold for medical interventions in the Spanish setting. Sensitivity analysis showed that age at the beginning of treatment was an important factor that influenced the ICER. A potential reduction in PI costs would also clearly improve the ICER, and transition probabilities influenced the results, but to a lesser extent. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that 95 % of the simulations presented an ICER below euro40,000/QALY. Post hoc estimations of sustained virological responses of the IL28B-guided therapeutic option represented a limitation of the study. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic options analysed for the base-case cohort can be considered cost-effective interventions for the Spanish healthcare framework.

11880,De-escalation from micafungin is a cost-effective alternative to traditional escalation from fluconazole in the treatment of patients with systemic Candida infections,"BACKGROUND: Systemic Candida infections (SCI) occur predominantly in intensive care unit patients and are a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Recently, changes in Candida epidemiology with an increasing prevalence of SCI caused by Candida non-albicans species have been reported. Resistance to fluconazole and azoles in general is not uncommon for non-albicans species. Despite guidelines recommending initial treatment with broad-spectrum antifungals such as echinocandins with subsequent switch to fluconazole if isolates are sensitive (de-escalation strategy), fluconazole is still the preferred first-line antifungal (escalation) in many clinical practice settings. After diagnosis of the pathogen, the initial therapy with fluconazole is switched to a broad-spectrum antifungal if a non-albicans is identified. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness of initial treatment with micafungin (de-escalation) vs fluconazole (escalation) in patients with SCI was estimated using decision analysis based on clinical and microbiological data from pertinent studies. The model horizon was 42 days, and was extrapolated to cover a lifetime horizon. All costs were analyzed from the UK NHS perspective. Several assumptions were taken to address uncertainties; the limitations of these assumptions are discussed in the article. RESULTS: In patients with fluconazole-resistant isolates, initial treatment with micafungin avoids 30% more deaths and successfully treats 23% more patients than initial treatment with fluconazole, with cost savings of pound1621 per treated patient. In the overall SCI population, de-escalation results in 1.2% fewer deaths at a marginal cost of pound740 per patient. Over a lifetime horizon, the incremental cost-effectiveness of de-escalation vs escalation was pound15,522 per life-year and pound25,673 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: De-escalation from micafungin may improve clinical outcomes and overall survival, particularly among patients with fluconazole-resistant Candida strains.

11884,A cost-effectiveness analysis of a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children in six Latin American countries,"BACKGROUND: A recently developed 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable H influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) is expected to afford protection against more than two thirds of isolates causing IPD in children in Latin America, and also against acute otitis media caused by both Spn and NTHi. The objective of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of PHiD-CV in comparison to non-vaccination in children under 10 years of age in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. METHODS: We used a static, deterministic, compartmental simulation model. The dosing regimen considered included three vaccine doses (at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months) and a booster dose (at 13 months) (3 + 1 schedule). Model outcomes included number of cases prevented, deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and costs. Discount for costs and benefits of long term sequelae was done at 3.5%, and currency reported in 2008-2009 U$S varying between countries. RESULTS: The largest effect in case prevention was observed in pneumococcal meningitis (from 27% in Peru to 47% in Colombia), neurologic sequelae after meningitis (from 38% in Peru to 65% in Brazil) and bacteremia (from 42% in Argentina to 49% in Colombia). The proportion of predicted deaths averted annually ranged from 18% in Peru to 33% in Brazil. Overall, the health benefits achieved with PHiD-CV vaccination resulted in a lower QALY loss (from 15% lower in Peru to 26% in Brazil). At a cost of USD 20 per vaccine dose, vaccination was cost-effective in all countries, from being cost saving in Chile to a maximum Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio of 7,088 US$ Dollars per QALY gained.

11889,A cost-effectiveness analysis of a 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children in six Latin American countries,"BACKGROUND: A recently developed 10-valent pneumococcal non-typeable H influenzae protein D-conjugate vaccine (PHiD-CV) is expected to afford protection against more than two thirds of isolates causing IPD in children in Latin America, and also against acute otitis media caused by both Spn and NTHi. The objective of this study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of PHiD-CV in comparison to non-vaccination in children under 10 years of age in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. METHODS: We used a static, deterministic, compartmental simulation model. The dosing regimen considered included three vaccine doses (at 2 months, 4 months and 6 months) and a booster dose (at 13 months) (3 + 1 schedule). Model outcomes included number of cases prevented, deaths averted, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained and costs. Discount for costs and benefits of long term sequelae was done at 3.5%, and currency reported in 2008-2009 U$S varying between countries. RESULTS: The largest effect in case prevention was observed in pneumococcal meningitis (from 27% in Peru to 47% in Colombia), neurologic sequelae after meningitis (from 38% in Peru to 65% in Brazil) and bacteremia (from 42% in Argentina to 49% in Colombia). The proportion of predicted deaths averted annually ranged from 18% in Peru to 33% in Brazil. Overall, the health benefits achieved with PHiD-CV vaccination resulted in a lower QALY loss (from 15% lower in Peru to 26% in Brazil). At a cost of USD 20 per vaccine dose, vaccination was cost-effective in all countries, from being cost saving in Chile to a maximum Incremental Cost-effectiveness Ratio of 7,088 US$ Dollars per QALY gained.

11890,Surgical outcomes and cost basis for resident-performed cataract surgery in an uninsured patient population,"IMPORTANCE: In the past, resident physicians have provided care to indigent patients under the supervision of experienced physicians. General consensus exists regarding higher surgical costs of patient care at teaching hospitals. No study has examined the outcomes or the cost basis for resident physicians providing health care to an underserved population. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the visual results in uninsured patients undergoing cataract surgery performed by resident surgeons at a single institution and to determine the cost-effectiveness of care. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective case series of consecutive uninsured patients undergoing cataract procedures performed by attending-supervised resident physicians at the University of Washington from July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2011. Data obtained included demographic information, preoperative and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the eye undergoing the procedure, and surgical complications.We calculated the costs of services rendered and normalized them to 2011 dollars. These data were incorporated into time-trade-off discounted utility values. Data were expressed as mean (SD). PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-three consecutive patients. EXPOSURE: Cataract surgical procedures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Costs of the surgical procedure and the utility value associated with the BCVA in the operated-on eye, RESULTS: The mean logMAR preoperative BCVA was 1.09 (0.74) (Snellen equivalent, 20/300). The best-recorded mean postoperative BCVA was 0.24 (0.42) (Snellen equivalent, 20/40), obtained at 3.77 (9.30) months. The final recorded mean BCVA was 0.27 (0.43) (Snellen equivalent, 20/40), obtained at a median (SD) follow-up of 16.32 (17.10) months. Four complications in 3 eyes required a second operation; 15 postoperative laser procedures were performed. The mean health care cost per patient was $3437.24 ($1334.68). Using these data, the mean utility value of cataract surgery in this population was 0.80 (0.12); the quality-adjusted life-years gained, 2.43 (1.87); and the discounted ratio of cost to utility, $1889.16 ($4800.62). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data support the success and cost-effectiveness of supervised, resident-performed cataract surgery in an underserved patient population. This study lends support for continuing this traditional scheme of surgical training and education. Further work must ensure that we remain aware of the balance between education and patient care.",2013-01-14303,24010149,JAMA Ophthalmol,Daniel B Moore,2013,131 / 7,891-7,No,24010149,"Daniel B Moore; Mark A Slabaugh; Surgical outcomes and cost basis for resident-performed cataract surgery in an uninsured patient population, JAMA Ophthalmol, ; 131(7):2168-6173; 891-7",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Resident-performed cataract surgery vs. None,Uninsured patients,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Not Stated / None,3.00,Not Stated,1414.5,United States,2011,1627.5
11891,Prasugrel compared to clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutenaous coronary intervention: a Spanish model-based cost effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term cost-effectiveness of 12 months treatment of prasugrel compared to clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the Spanish health care system. METHODS: A Markov state transition model was developed to estimate health outcomes, quality adjusted life years (QALYs), life years (LY), and costs over patients'' lifetimes. Clinical inputs were based on an analysis of the TRITON-TIMI 38 clinical trial. Hospital readmissions captured during the trial in a sub-study of patients from eight countries (and subsequent re-hospitalisations modelled to accrue beyond the time horizon of the trial), were assigned to Spanish diagnosis-related group payment schedules to estimate hospitalisation costs. RESULTS: Mean total treatment costs were ?11,427 and ?10,910 for prasugrel and clopidogrel respectively. The mean cost of the study drug was ?538 higher for prasugrel vs. clopidogrel, but rehospitalisation costs at 12 months were ?79 lower for prasugrel due to reduced rates of revascularisation. Hospitalisation costs beyond 12 months were higher with prasugrel by ?55, due to longer life expectancy (+0.071 LY and +0.054 QALYs) associated with the decreased nonfatal myocardial infarction rate in the prasugrel group. The incremental cost per life year and QALY gained with prasugrel was ?7,198, and ?9,489, respectively.

11892,Cost-effectiveness analysis: comparing single-level cervical disc replacement and single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion: clinical article,"OBJECT: In recent years, there has been increased interest in the use of cervical disc replacement (CDR) as an alternative to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF). While ACDF is a proven intervention for patients with myelopathy or radiculopathy, it does have inherent limitations. Cervical disc replacement was designed to preserve motion, avoid the limitations of fusion, and theoretically allow for a quicker return to activity. A number of recently published systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials have demonstrated positive clinical results for CDR, but no studies have revealed which of the 2 treatment strategies is more cost-effective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CDR and ACDF by using the power of decision analysis. Additionally, the authors aimed to identify the most critical factors affecting procedural cost and effectiveness and to define thresholds for durability and function to focus and guide future research. METHODS: The authors created a surgical decision model for the treatment of single-level cervical disc disease with associated radiculopathy. The literature was reviewed to identify possible outcomes and their likelihood following CDR and ACDF. Health state utility factors were determined from the literature and assigned to each possible outcome, and procedural effectiveness was expressed in units of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Using ICD-9 procedure codes and data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the authors calculated the median cost of hospitalization by multiplying hospital charges by the hospital-specific cost-to-charge ratio. Gross physician costs were determined from the mean Medicare reimbursement for each current procedural terminology (CPT) code. Uncertainty as regards both cost and effectiveness numbers was assessed using sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: In the reference case, the model assumed a 20-year duration for the CDR prosthesis. Cervical disc replacement led to higher average QALYs gained at a lower cost to society if both strategies survived for 20 years ($3042/QALY for CDR vs $8760/QALY for ACDF). Sensitivity analysis revealed that CDR needed to survive at least 9.75 years to be considered a more cost-effective strategy than ACDF. Cervical disc replacement becomes an acceptable societal strategy as the prosthesis survival time approaches 11 years and the $50,000/QALY gained willingness-to-pay threshold is crossed. Sensitivity analysis also indicated that CDR must provide a utility state of at least 0.796 to be cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: Both CDR and ACDF were shown to be cost-effective procedures in the reference case. Results of the sensitivity analysis indicated that CDR must remain functional for at least 14 years to establish greater cost-effectiveness than ACDF. Since the current literature has yet to demonstrate with certainty the actual durability and long-term functionality of CDR, future long-term studies are required to validate the present analysis.",2013-01-14305,24010896,J Neurosurg Spine,Sheeraz A Qureshi,2013,19 / 5,546-54,No,24010896,"Sheeraz A Qureshi; Steven McAnany; Vadim Goz; Steven M Koehler; Andrew C Hecht; Cost-effectiveness analysis: comparing single-level cervical disc replacement and single-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion: clinical article, J Neurosurg Spine, ; 19(5):1547-5654; 546-54",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Single-level cervical disc replacement vs. single-level anterior cervical discectomy,Not Stated,45 Years,45 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-2394.06,United States,2010,-2841.51
11893,Photoselective vaporization for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia,"BACKGROUND: As an alternative to transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) provides a bloodless, relatively painless relief of lower urinary tract symptoms for men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Following a review of the evidence in 2006, the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee recommended that a study be conducted to evaluate PVP in Ontario. OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical effectiveness, safety, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact of PVP compared to conventional TURP for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia in Ontario. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized trial was conducted in 3 Ontario centres. Consenting subjects were assessed at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months following surgery. Outcome measures included International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), peak urinary flow rate (Qmax), post-void residual (PVR) volume, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), health-related quality of life (HRQOL) using the EuroQol 5 Domain questionnaire, and the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score. Adverse events, resource utilization, and productivity losses were also assessed. Cost-effectiveness and budget impact analyses were completed using data from the study. RESULTS: Between February 2008 and August 2010, 164 subjects were enrolled in the study (n = 140 for PVP and n = 24 for TURP). Treatment outcomes were similar between the 2 groups at 6 months, with the IPSS decreasing similarly over time (P = 0.718). For other treatment outcomes (Qmax, PSA, HRQOL, SHIM) both treatments provided similar benefit over time; only changes in PVR volume favoured PVP (P = 0.018). The majority of PVP patients were managed on an outpatient basis, with only 7.1% requiring admission (all TURP subjects were inpatients). At 6 months, PVP was less costly than TURP ($3,891 versus $4,863; P = 0.001), with similar quality-adjusted life-years (0.448 versus 0.441; P = 0.658). PVP remained the most cost-effective treatment across all decision-making thresholds, with the technology costing less and providing similar clinical outcomes. Extrapolating the results to a provincial level indicated (based on an estimated case volume of 12,335 TURPs) that there is an opportunity to reallocate just over $14 million (Cdn), primarily related to the reduced need for hospital admission. LIMITATIONS: This study was nonrandomized, and the results should be interpreted with some caution, despite generally similar baseline characteristics between the 2 groups. Recruiting individuals to the TURP arm was a challenge, resulting in a size imbalance between treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this analysis, PVP appears to be a cost-effective alternative to TURP, providing similar clinical benefit at a lower cost to the health system.",2013-01-14314,24019857,Ont Health Technol Assess Ser,James M Bowen,2013,13 / 2,1-34,No,24019857,"James M Bowen; J Paul Whelan; Robert B Hopkins; Natasha Burke; Edward A Woods; Gary P McIsaac; Daria J O'Reilly; Feng Xie; Shayan Sehatzadeh; Leslie Levin; Suja P Mathew; Lisa L Patterson; Ron Goeree; Jean-Eric Tarride; Photoselective vaporization for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, Ont Health Technol Assess Ser, ; 13(2):1915-7398; 1-34",QALY,Canada,Not Stated,Not Stated,Photoselective vaporization of the prostate vs. Transurethral resection of the prostate,Not Stated,Not Stated,41 Years,Male,Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-138857.14,Canada,2011,-161598.24
11894,Cost-effectiveness analysis of Tdap in the prevention of pertussis in the elderly,"OBJECTIVES: Health benefits and costs of combined reduced-antigen-content tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (Tdap) immunization among adults >/=65 years have not been evaluated. In February 2012, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended expanding Tdap vaccination (one single dose) to include adults >/=65 years not previously vaccinated with Tdap. Our study estimated the health and economic outcomes of one-time replacement of the decennial tetanus and diphtheria (Td) booster with Tdap in the 10% of individuals aged 65 years assumed eligible each year compared with a baseline scenario of continued Td vaccination. METHODS: We constructed a model evaluating the cost-effectiveness of vaccinating a cohort of adults aged 65 with Tdap, by calculating pertussis cases averted due to direct vaccine effects only. Results are presented from societal and payer perspectives for a range of pertussis incidences (25-200 cases per 100,000), due to the uncertainty in estimating true annual incidence. Cases averted were accrued throughout the patient ''s lifetime, and a probability tree used to estimate the clinical outcomes and costs (US$ 2010) for each case. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost to acute disease were calculated by multiplying cases of mild/moderate/severe pertussis by the associated health-state disutility; QALY losses due to death and long-term sequelae were also considered. Incremental costs and QALYs were summed over the cohort to derive incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Scenario analyses evaluated the effect of alternative plausible parameter estimates on results. RESULTS: At incidence levels of 25, 100, 200 cases/100,000, vaccinating adults aged 65 years costs an additional $336,000, $63,000 and $17,000/QALY gained, respectively. Vaccination has a cost-effectiveness ratio less than $50,000/QALY if pertussis incidence is >116 cases/100,000 from societal and payer perspectives. Results were robust to scenario analyses.

11900,Cost-effectiveness of Xpert(R) MTB/RIF for diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis in the United States,"SETTING: Conventional approaches to tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and resistance testing are slow. The Xpert(R) MTB/RIF assay is an emerging molecular diagnostic assay for rapid TB diagnosis, offering results within 2 hours. However, the cost-effectiveness of implementing Xpert in settings with low TB prevalence, such as the United States, is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of incorporating Xpert into TB diagnostic algorithms in the United States compared to existing diagnostics. DESIGN: A decision-analysis model compared current TB diagnostic algorithms in the United States to algorithms incorporating Xpert. Primary outcomes were the costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued with each strategy; cost-effectiveness was represented using incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). RESULTS: Xpert testing of a single sputum sample from TB suspects is expected to result in lower total health care costs per patient (US2673) compared to diagnostic algorithms using only sputum microscopy and culture (US2728) and improved health outcomes (6.32 QALYs gained per 1000 TB suspects).
