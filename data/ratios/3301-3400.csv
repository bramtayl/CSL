3301,Assessment of clinical and economic benefits of weight management with sibutramine in general practice in Germany,"Obesity is associated with major health risks and a high economic burden impacting on health care systems. This study utilises the latest evidence from randomised clinical trials (RCTs) to explore and to assess the cost effectiveness of sibutramine in combination with diet and lifestyle advice compared to diet and lifestyle advice alone for the treatment of obese subjects without comorbidities at baseline in Germany. New evidence from recently published RCTs and post-marketing surveillance studies, including health economic data as well as quality of life (QoL) data, were used to model the long-term outcomes of weight management with sibutramine in German practice. German healthcare costs and new data from over 8,000 patients were analysed based on a recently published model. These new RCT data were used to model weight losses, proportion of responders to treatment, utilities by weight loss and variability in weight regain post-treatment. Costs and QoL benefits associated with weight loss (using SF-36 data from sibutramine trials), reduced incidence of coronary heart disease (using Framingham equations) and diabetes were used to estimate the cost per quality adjusted life year of sibutramine treatment. For 1,000 patients treated with sibutramine for 1 year, extrapolating outcomes over 4 further years, sibutramine is estimated to save 4.18 CHD events, 2.58 diabetes incident cases and give 51.5 more quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The cost-utility analysis (CUA) estimates 13,706 euro per QALY gained. Results are sensitive to changes in weight loss, rate of weight regain and discounting rate. Although the non-pharmacological weight management programme in the comparator arm yielded higher weight losses than generally observed in clinical practice, these results demonstrate that additional sibutramine treatment is a cost effective therapy for an obese population without comorbidities in Germany. The CUA results are within the range generally accepted as cost effective and should be viewed as conservative when generalizing to settings offering standard non-pharmacological treatment.",2006-01-02385,17063345,Eur J Health Econ,Alan Brennan,2006,7 / 4,276-84,Yes,17063345,"Alan Brennan; Roberta Ara; Raimund Sterz; Bernd Matiba; Rito Bergemann; Assessment of clinical and economic benefits of weight management with sibutramine in general practice in Germany, Eur J Health Econ, 2006-Dec; 7(4):1618-7598; 276-84",QALY,Germany,Not Stated,Not Stated,Sibutramine in combination with the best non-pharmacological practice aimed at changing lifestyle for weight reduction,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,5 Years,5.00,Not Stated,13706,Euro,2004,23357.04
3302,Is cataract surgery cost-effective among older patients with a low predicted probability for improvement in reported visual functioning?,"INTRODUCTION: Although cataract surgery has been demonstrated to be effective and cost-effective, 5% to 20% of patients do not benefit functionally from the procedure. This study examines the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery versus watchful waiting in a subgroup of patients who had less than a 30% predicted probability of reporting improvements in visual function after surgery. METHODS: Randomized trial (first eye surgery vs. watchful waiting) of 250 patients who based on a cataract surgery index (CSI) were felt to have less than a 30% probability of reporting improvements in visual functioning after surgery. Cost was estimated using monthly resource utilization surveys and Medicare billing and payment data. Effectiveness was evaluated at 6 months using the Activities of Daily Vision Scale (ADVS) and the Health Utilities Index, Mark 3 (HUI3). RESULTS: In terms of overall utility, the incremental cost-effectiveness of surgery was Dollars 38,288/QALY. In the subgroup of patients with a CSI score > 11 (< 20% probability of improvement), the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery was Dollars 53,500/QALY. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that often this population of patients may not derive a utility benefit with surgery. CONCLUSION: Cataract surgery is cost-effective even in a subpopulation of patient with a lower, < 30%, predicted probability of reporting improved visual functioning after surgery.

3305,Is intraoperative touch imprint cytology of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer cost effective?,"BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are generally evaluated postoperatively, requiring 5-7 days for assessment. SLNs can also be evaluated intraoperatively by using touch imprint cytology (TIC), thus providing the surgeon immediate feedback and allowing for concurrent completion node dissection (CND) for positive SLNs. The authors hypothesized that TIC, when compared with standard postoperative SLN assessment alone, would permit a cost-effective evaluation of SLNs in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer. METHODS: A decision-analysis model was created to compare TIC with standard postoperative SLN assessment alone. Sensitivity and specificity of TIC were determined prospectively from 342 patients who underwent SLN biopsy assessed by both techniques. Short-term health states associated with surgical staging were defined, and utilities were estimated using EuroQol-5D. Base-case analysis was performed to estimate quality-adjusted life years and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine stability of model parameters. RESULTS: For each tumor stage, TIC was cost effective, and for patients with larger tumors (T3 and T4), TIC was the dominant strategy. The analysis was robust to changes in sensitivity and specificity of TIC, prevalence of metastasis, probability of complications, and cost. However, when utility associated with standard SLN assessment was 0.9 or greater, this became the preferred strategy. CONCLUSIONS: TIC is cost effective for assessing SLN metastasis intraoperatively. For patients with larger tumors, it is not only more effective, but also less costly than standard SLN assessment alone.

3309,The cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy for borderline personality disorder: results from the BOSCOT trial,"Borderline personality disorder places a significant burden on healthcare providers and other agencies. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavior therapy plus treatment as usual compared to treatment as usual alone for patients with borderline personality disorder. The economic analysis was conducted alongside a multi-center, randomized controlled trial. The costs of primary and secondary healthcare utilization, alongside the wider economic costs, were estimated from medical records and patient self-report. The primary outcome measure used was the quality-adjusted life year (QALY), assessed using EuroQol. On average, total costs per patient in the cognitive behavior therapy group were lower than patients receiving usual care alone (-689 pounds sterling), although this group also reported a lower quality of life (-0.11 QALYs). These differences were small and did not approach conventional levels of statistical significance.

3310,Cost-effectiveness of oxaliplatin and capecitabine in the adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer,"For many years, the standard treatment for stage III colon cancer has been surgical resection followed by 5-fluorouracil in combination with folinic acid (5-FU/LV). Ongoing clinical trial evidence suggests that capecitabine and oxaliplatin (in combination with 5-FU/LV) may improve disease-free survival and overall survival when compared against 5-FU/LV alone in the adjuvant setting. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness profiles of these two regimens in comparison to standard chemotherapy, using evidence from two international randomised controlled trials. Survival modelling techniques were employed to extrapolate survival curves from the two trials in order to estimate the long-term benefits of alternative treatment options over the remaining lifetime of patients. The health economic analysis suggests that capecitabine is expected to produce greater health gains at a lower cost than 5-FU/LV. Oxaliplatin in combination with 5-FU/LV is estimated to cost pounds 2970 per additional QALY gained when compared to 5-FU/LV alone.

The alternative regime is found to be more cost-effective for a sample of properties in Brixworth, Northamptonshire, UK.

3313,Economic evaluation of the artificial liver support system MARS in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) is a life threatening acute decompensation of a pre-existing chronic liver disease. The artificial liver support system MARS is a new emerging therapeutic option possible to be implemented in routine care of these patients. The medical efficacy of MARS has been demonstrated in first clinical studies, but economic aspects have so far not been investigated. Objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of MARS. METHODS: In a clinical cohort trial with a prospective follow-up of 3 years 33 ACLF-patients treated with MARS were compared to 46 controls. Survival, health-related quality of life as well as direct medical costs for in- and outpatient treatment from a health care system perspective were determined. Based on the differences in outcome and indirect costs the cost-effectiveness of MARS expressed as incremental costs per life year gained and incremental costs per QALY gained was estimated. RESULTS: The average initial intervention costs for MARS were 14600 EUR per patient treated. Direct medical costs over 3 years follow up were overall 40000 EUR per patient treated with MARS respectively 12700 EUR in controls. The 3 year survival rate after MARS was 52% compared to 17% in controls. Kaplan-Meier analysis of cumulated survival probability showed a highly significant difference in favour of MARS. Incremental costs per life-year gained were 31400 EUR; incremental costs per QALY gained were 47200 EUR. CONCLUSION: The results after 3 years follow-up of the first economic evaluation study of MARS based on empirical patient data are presented. Although high initial treatment costs for MARS occur the significantly better survival seen in this study led to reasonable costs per live year gained.

DESIGN: Two decision analytic models were designed, one with and the other without accounting for increased risk of asthma following respiratory syncytial virus infection. SETTING: A hypothetical community or university hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical cohorts of infants without chronic lung disease born at 26 to 32 weeks' gestation. INTERVENTIONS: Palivizumab prophylaxis vs no prophylaxis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Expected costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per quality-adjusted life-year. RESULTS: The expected costs were higher for palivizumab prophylaxis as compared with no prophylaxis. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were high for all gestations and are not considered cost-effective by today's standards (<$200 000 per quality-adjusted life-year). Both models were sensitive to variation in the cost of palivizumab. The model that included asthma was sensitive to variation in quality of life for children with asthma. In instances where asthma was considered severe with profound worsening in quality of life compared with life without asthma, some infants had an incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year that was less than $200 000.

3321,Is self-care a cost-effective use of resources? Evidence from a randomized trial in inflammatory bowel disease,"OBJECTIVES: To determine if a whole-system approach to self-management in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), using a guidebook developed with patients and physicians trained in patient-centred care, leads to cost-effective use of health system resources. METHODS: Cost-effectiveness analysis over a one-year time horizon comparing the whole systems self-management approach to treatment with usual treatment. Nineteen hospitals in the northwest England were randomized to the intervention or to be controls; 651 patients (285 at intervention sites and 366 at control sites) with established IBD were included. The economic evaluation related differential health service costs, from a UK NHS perspective, to differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) based on patients' responses to the EQ-5D. RESULTS: The intervention was associated with a mean reduction in costs of 148 pounds sterling per patient and a small mean reduction in QALYs of 0.00022 per patient compared with the control group. This resulted in an incremental cost per QALY gained of 676,417 pounds sterling for treatment as usual and a probability of around 63% that the whole-system approach to self-management is cost-effective, assuming a willingness to pay up to 30,000 pounds sterling for an additional QALY. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is uncertainty associated with these estimates, more widespread use of this method in chronic disease management seems likely to reduce health care costs without evidence of adverse effect on patient outcomes.",2006-01-02410,17018196,J Health Serv Res Policy,Gerald Richardson,2006,11 / 4,225-30,No,17018196,"Gerald Richardson; Mark Sculpher; Anne Kennedy; Elizabeth Nelson; David Reeves; Chris Roberts; Andrew Robinson; Anne Rogers; David Thompson; Is self-care a cost-effective use of resources?

3322,Cost-utility of routine cataract surgery,"BACKGROUND: If decisions on health care spending are to be as rational and objective as possible, knowledge on cost-effectiveness of routine care is essential. Our aim, therefore, was to evaluate the cost-utility of routine cataract surgery in a real-world setting. METHODS: Prospective assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients undergoing cataract surgery. 219 patients (mean (SD) age 71 (11) years) entering cataract surgery (in 87 only first eye operated, in 73 both eyes operated, in 59 first eye had been operated earlier) filled in the 15D HRQoL questionnaire before and six months after operation. Direct hospital costs were obtained from a clinical patient administration database and cost-utility analysis performed from the perspective of the secondary care provider extrapolating benefits of surgery to the remaining statistical life-expectancy of the patients. RESULTS: Mean (SD) utility score (on a 0-1 scale) increased statistically insignificantly from 0.82 (0.13) to 0.83 (0.14). Of the 15 dimensions of the HRQoL instrument, only seeing improved significantly after operation.

3325,Cost-effectiveness of anastrozole compared to tamoxifen in hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer. Analysis based on the ATAC trial,"The 5-year completed treatment analysis of the Anastrozole and Tamoxifen-Alone or in Combination (ATAC) trial showed the superiority of anastrozole over tamoxifen for reduction of disease progression in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early breast cancer (EBC). The objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of anastrozole versus tamoxifen in this setting. A health economic model was developed comparing the natural history of EBC patients treated with anastrozole or tamoxifen. The perspective of the Belgian health care system was taken. Disease progression from EBC was obtained from the ATAC trial and further progression beyond the clinical trial from published literature. Resource use data were obtained from the ATAC study and from published local retrospective data. Anastrozole was cost-effective versus tamoxifen, provided that a time horizon of at least 9 years is taken. This sensitivity to time horizon is inherently associated with the adjuvant setting due to the different evolution of costs and outcomes over time. Costs are incurred solely during the first 5 years, whereas outcomes are cumulated beyond adjuvant treatment. In conclusion, provided that a sufficient time horizon is taken and that long-term model predictions are confirmed from further follow-up from the ATAC study, anastrozole is a highly cost-effective adjuvant therapy compared to tamoxifen.",2006-01-02419,17010076,Int J Gynecol Cancer,K Moeremans,2006,16 Suppl 2 /,576-8,No,17010076,"K Moeremans; L Annemans; Cost-effectiveness of anastrozole compared to tamoxifen in hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer.

3326,An economic evaluation of strontium ranelate in the treatment of osteoporosis in a Swedish setting: based on the results of the SOTI and TROPOS trials,"INTRODUCTION: Strontium ranelate is a new therapy for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis that has been shown in two phase III clinical trials (the Spinal Osteoporosis Therapeutic Intervention [SOTI] and the Treatment Of Peripheral OSteoporosis Study [TROPOS] trials) to reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures at the vertebral, non-vertebral and hip level in postmenopausal women. The aim of this study was to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of strontium ranelate in the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal Swedish patients. METHODS: A Markov cohort model was adapted to fit patients corresponding to the patients in the SOTI and TROPOS clinical trials. The model was populated with Swedish cost and epidemiological data. In the base case, the cost-effectiveness was estimated for 69-year old women with low bone mineral density (BMD) and prevalent vertebral fractures (SOTI) and for 77-year old women with low BMD (TROPOS). The cost-effectiveness analysis had a societal perspective. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained of strontium ranelate patients compared to no treatment patients was estimated at SEK 472,586 and SEK 259,643, including costs in added life years, based on the SOTI and the TROPOS trials, respectively. Excluding cost in added life years, the cost per QALY gained was estimated at SEK 336,420 (SOTI) and SEK 165,680 (TROPOS). In subgroup analyses, in patients 74 years and older with a T-score lower than -2.4 and patients older than 80 years of age, strontium ranelate was found to be cost saving compared to no treatment.

3328,Cost-effectiveness of recombinant activated factor VII in the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is among the most costly and debilitating forms of stroke. Results from a recent Phase IIb clinical trial demonstrate that administration of recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) reduces ICH mortality and improves functional outcome. In the current analysis, we examine the cost-effectiveness of early treatment with rFVIIa for ICH in the United States. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with rFVIIa treatment at doses of 40, 80 and 160 microg/kg compared with current standard of care in treating ICH, from a US third-party payer perspective. The patient population was similar to that of the Phase IIb clinical trial. Model structure and inputs were obtained from published literature, clinical trial data, claims databases, and expert opinion. All costs are presented in 2005 US dollars. Outcomes included incremental cost per life-year (LY) saved and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model robustness. RESULTS: Compared with standard care, treatment with rFVIIa 40 microg/kg, and 160 microg/kg results in total lifetime cost-effectiveness ratios of 6308 dollars/QALY and 3152 dollars/QALY, respectively. Treatment with rFVIIa 80 microg/kg was found to be cost saving and a gain of 1.67 QALYs is achieved over a patient's lifetime. These results are robust to changes in input parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ICH with rFVIIa 40 microg/kg and 160 microg/kg appears to be cost-effective (<or=50,000 dollars/QALY).

In the current analysis, we examine the cost-effectiveness of early treatment with rFVIIa for ICH in the United States. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate the lifetime costs and outcomes associated with rFVIIa treatment at doses of 40, 80 and 160 microg/kg compared with current standard of care in treating ICH, from a US third-party payer perspective. The patient population was similar to that of the Phase IIb clinical trial. Model structure and inputs were obtained from published literature, clinical trial data, claims databases, and expert opinion. All costs are presented in 2005 US dollars. Outcomes included incremental cost per life-year (LY) saved and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3% annually. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model robustness. RESULTS: Compared with standard care, treatment with rFVIIa 40 microg/kg, and 160 microg/kg results in total lifetime cost-effectiveness ratios of 6308 dollars/QALY and 3152 dollars/QALY, respectively. Treatment with rFVIIa 80 microg/kg was found to be cost saving and a gain of 1.67 QALYs is achieved over a patient's lifetime. These results are robust to changes in input parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of ICH with rFVIIa 40 microg/kg and 160 microg/kg appears to be cost-effective (<or=50,000 dollars/QALY). At the 80 microg/kg dose, rFVIIa was not only cost-effective, but also cost saving.",2006-01-02421,17008607,Stroke,Stephanie R Earnshaw,2006,37 / 11,2751-8,No,17008607,"Stephanie R Earnshaw; Ashish V Joshi; Michele R Wilson; Jonathan Rosand; Cost-effectiveness of recombinant activated factor VII in the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage, Stroke, 2006-Nov; 37(11):1524-4628; 2751-8",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Recombinant Activated Factor VII (rFVIIa) 80 g/kg,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-2496.12,United States,2005,-3307.85

3331,The cost effectiveness of anticoagulation management services for patients with atrial fibrillation and at high risk of stroke in the US,"BACKGROUND: Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is widely considered the standard of care for stoke prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at high risk of stroke. Community-based studies in the US have reported that the effectiveness of anticoagulation varies by management approach and that patients receiving warfarin have international normalised ratio (INR) values within the target therapeutic range less than half the time. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the lifetime societal costs and health benefits of warfarin therapy to prevent strokes, specifically in elderly patients (mean age 70 years) with atrial fibrillation who are at high risk of stroke, when anticoagulation is managed through usual care versus anticoagulation management services, where dedicated anticoagulation professionals (e.g. physician or pharmacist) monitor and oversee patients. METHODS: Semi-Markov decision model with a 30-day cycle length and 10-year time horizon (to reflect the mean life expectancy of the study population). Univariate sensitivity analyses and Bayesian second-order multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulation were performed. Outcomes measures were costs and QALYs. Most of the probability and outcome estimates included were derived from the recent SPORTIF (Stroke Prevention using ORal Thrombin Inhibitor in atrial Fibrillation) V trial. Utility values were derived from a large, nationally representative sample of individuals in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and were adjusted for age, sex, race, ethnicity, income, education and co-morbidity. Resource utilisation was based on experience at the University Medicine Group Practice Anticoagulation Clinic (University of Colorado, Denver, CO, USA) and costs ($US; 2004 values) included were for warfarin and aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) use and those associated with major bleeding, treatment of primary events, routine INR and biochemistry monitoring, ECGs, and clinic visits. Costs and outcomes were discounted by 3% per annum. RESULTS: The anticoagulation management service improved effectiveness by 0.057 (95% credible interval 0, 0.36) QALYs and reduced costs by $US2100 (95% credible interval -$US19,800, $US300) [2004 values] compared with usual care. Results were sensitive to the extent of the increase in risk of primary events (all strokes and systemic embolic events attributable to usual care, but were robust to variation in other input variables). The anticoagulation management service was the dominant strategy in 91% of Monte Carlo simulations. CONCLUSION: The anticoagulation management service appears to cost less and provide greater effectiveness than usual care. To enhance stroke prophylaxis among high-risk patients with atrial fibrillation, physicians and Medicare plans may wish to consider augmenting 'usual care' by the addition of patient-monitoring technology strategies such as formally organised anticoagulation monitoring programmes.",2006-01-02424,17002484,Pharmacoeconomics,Patrick W Sullivan,2006,24 / 10,1021-33,Yes,17002484,"Patrick W Sullivan; Thomas W Arant; Samuel L Ellis; Heather Ulrich; The cost effectiveness of anticoagulation management services for patients with atrial fibrillation and at high risk of stroke in the US, Pharmacoeconomics, 2006; 24(10):1179-2027; 1021-33",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Wafarin in managed care services,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-35948.28,United States,2004,-49252.57
3333,Clinical and economic outcomes of nonadherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus,"BACKGROUND: Nonadherence with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is common in typical human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patient care settings, but the consequences have not been well described. This study aimed to quantify the clinical and economic effects of nonadherence and estimate the cost-effectiveness of improving adherence in treatment-naive HIV patients. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to project quality-adjusted life expectancy and direct medical costs for patients on an initial once-daily regimen of efavirenz, lamivudine, and stavudine XR. The model compared 2 adherence scenarios: ""ideal"" (based on clinical trials) and ""typical"" (based on observational studies in actual practice). Disease progression was a function of viral load, CD4 count, and adherence. Data on HIV natural history, treatment benefits, costs, and utilities were derived from the literature. RESULTS: With typical adherence, patients lose 1.2 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that could be gained with ideal adherence. Improving adherence to ideal levels is cost-effective at 29,400 US dollars/QALY gained. As much as 1,600 US dollars/y per patient could be spent on an intervention to improve adherence to ideal levels, and the incremental cost-effectiveness would remain less than 50,000 US dollars/QALY gained. A cost-effectiveness ratio of 50,000 US dollars/QALY is a commonly accepted minimum standard for cost-effective medical interventions in the United States, although many experts believe this standard has drifted upwards over time. CONCLUSIONS: Typical adherence with HAART reduces quality-adjusted life expectancy by 12% compared with ideal adherence.

3334,Tension-free repair versus watchful waiting for men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias: a cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: Watchful waiting (WW) has been shown to be an acceptable option in men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernias when clinical and patient-reported outcomes are considered. Although WW is likely to be less costly initially when compared with tension-free repair (TFR) because of the cost of the operation, it is not clear whether WW remains the least costly option when longer-term costs are considered. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis of a randomized controlled trial at six community and academic centers. We examined costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), and cost-effectiveness at 2 years of followup. Costs were assessed by applying Medicare reimbursement rates to patients' health-care use, which was obtained by contacting patients' health-care providers. Quality of life was assessed using the Short Form-36 version 2 health-related quality-of-life survey. Of the 724 men randomized, 641 were available for the economic analysis: 317 were randomized to TFR and 324 were randomized to watchful waiting. RESULTS: At 2 years, TFR patients had $1,831 higher mean costs than WW patients (95% CI, $409-$3,044), with 0.031 higher QALY (95% CI, 0.001-0.058). The cost per additional QALY for TFR patients was $59,065 (95% CI, $1,358-$322,765). The probability that TFR was cost-effective at the $50,000 per QALY level was 40%.

Cost effectiveness is an important consideration when evidence for predominance of one surgical technique is lacking. Current cost estimates of hernia repair are not available. STUDY DESIGN: This study is a cost effectiveness analysis within a randomized controlled trial comparing open (OPEN) versus laparoscopic (LAP) hernia repair using mesh at 14 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers, with 2-year followup for each patient. Between January 1999 and November 2001, 2,164 men with inguinal hernia were randomized and 1,983 had an operation; 1,395 patients (708 OPEN and 687 LAP) with outpatient hernia operations were included in the cost effectiveness analysis. Outcomes included surgical and postoperative costs, quality adjusted life years (QALY), and incremental cost per QALY gained or the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: Over 2 years, LAP cost an average of $638 more than OPEN. QALYs at 2 years were similar, resulting in $45,899 per QALY gained (95% CI: -$669,045, $722,457).

3346,A cost-utility analysis of chronic spinal pain treatment outcomes: converting SF-36 data into quality-adjusted life years,"OBJECTIVES: The present retrospective case review study sought to analyze the cost-utility, expressed in cost/quality-adjusted life years (QALY), of current chronic spinal pain treatments. In addition, it expands upon previously published data evaluating the efficacy of interdisciplinary pain management in relation to medication management. METHODS: A recently developed algorithm was used to calculate QALYs using SF-36, v. 1 responses for 121 patients receiving treatment for chronic spinal pain at a pain rehabilitation center. Treatment groups evaluated were: (1) interdisciplinary program completers who received medication management and supplementary anesthetic procedures; (2) interdisciplinary program completers receiving medication management but not anesthetic procedures; (3) patients receiving medication management alone; and (4) patients receiving medication management with supplemental anesthetic procedures. Assessments were conducted at pretreatment and 6 months after the initiation of treatment. RESULTS: One-way analyses of covariance indicated that patients who participated in an interdisciplinary pain management program, which included medication management, psychotherapy, group education, and physical therapy, reported significantly less impairment in daily activities of living, less subjective experience of pain, and a higher quality of life and more preferred health state at the completion of their treatment phase, relative to patients receiving medication with or without anesthetic procedures. In addition, improvements in all outcome measures between pretreatment and posttreatment were significantly greater for those patients completing the interdisciplinary component of treatment. Cost-utility analyses revealed that the interdisciplinary treatment alone group was cost-saving, relative to the medication and procedures alternative, suggesting the former modality was both less costly and more effective than the latter. DISCUSSION: Average cost-utility ratios for both interdisciplinary treatment groups, ranging from 57,627 dollars /QALY to 75,885 dollars /QALY, were within established cost-effective parameters (20,000 dollars to 100,000 dollars /QALY, generally considered a good value), whereas cost-utility ratios for the standard care treatment groups were not interpretable because of a decrease in QALYs from pretreatment to posttreatment.",2006-01-02438,16988566,Clin J Pain,Alyson Lieban Hatten,2006,22 / 8,700-11,No,16988566,"Alyson Lieban Hatten; Robert J Gatchel; Peter B Polatin; Anna Wright Stowell; A cost-utility analysis of chronic spinal pain treatment outcomes: converting SF-36 data into quality-adjusted life years, Clin J Pain, 2006-Oct; 22(8):0749-8047; 700-11",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Medication management alone,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,221600,United States,2003,311698.47

3353,A randomised controlled trial of acupuncture care for persistent low back pain: cost effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of acupuncture in the management of persistent non-specific low back pain. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis of a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Three private acupuncture clinics and 18 general practices in York, England. PARTICIPANTS: 241 adults aged 18-65 with non-specific low back pain of 4-52 weeks' duration. INTERVENTIONS: Ten individualised acupuncture treatments over three months from acupuncturists trained in traditional Chinese medicine (n = 160) or usual care only (n = 81). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained over two years. RESULTS: Total costs to the United Kingdom's health service during the two year study period were higher on average for the acupuncture group (460 pounds sterling; 673 euros; 859 dollars) than for the usual care group (345 pounds sterling) because of the costs associated with initial treatment. The mean incremental health gain from acupuncture at 12 months was 0.012 QALYs (95% confidence interval -0.033 to 0.058) and at 24 months was 0.027 QALYs (-0.056 to 0.110), leading to a base case estimate of 4241 pounds sterling per QALY gained. This result was robust to sensitivity analysis. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed acupuncture to have a more than 90% chance of being cost effective at a pound20 000 cost per QALY threshold. CONCLUSION: A short course of traditional acupuncture for persistent non-specific low back pain in primary care confers a modest health benefit for minor extra cost to the NHS compared with usual care.

3355,"The economic value of anti-IgE in severe persistent, IgE-mediated (allergic) asthma patients: adaptation of INNOVATE to Sweden","BACKGROUND: Severe allergic asthma patients may not be controlled even with guideline recommended care, including inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-2 agonists, theophylline, oral steroids and anti-leukotrienes. They experience exacerbations requiring intensive healthcare use and which may be fatal. Omalizumab, a new monoclonal antibody for use in IgE-mediated allergic diseases, reduces exacerbations and daily symptoms in this patient population. The aim of this study is to estimate the cost effectiveness of adding omalizumab to optimized standard therapy (ST) in patients with severe persistent IgE-mediated (allergic) asthma. METHODS: A Markov model comparing lifelong ST with a treatment period of omalizumab add-on therapy followed by ST, was developed based on efficacy data from the INNOVATE trial (28 weeks, N = 419) and Swedish life table and cost data. This model assumes that patients are at risk of having an exacerbation every 2 weeks and are at risk of dying from a clinically significant severe asthma exacerbation. Patients in a steady-state of having no exacerbations are defined to be in an 'optimized asthma control' state. Resource use data and utilities were obtained from INNOVATE and from a UK observational study. Costs from a societal perspective include estimates for drugs, routine care, exacerbations and costs in added years of life; benefits are expressed in QALYs. The response to omalizumab was evaluated after 16 weeks of trial, and non-responders stopped taking omalizumab for the remaining time. RESULTS: Total lifetime discounted costs and QALYs on ST were 52,702 euros and 11.60. Omalizumab add-on therapy cost an additional 42,754 euros for 0.76 additional QALYs, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 56,091 euros. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicates that the 95% CI around the ICER is [31,328 euros; 120,552 euros]. One-way analyses indicate that the results are sensitive to the exacerbation-related mortality rate, the time horizon and the discount rates. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the model and the assumptions used, our results suggest that omalizumab provides cost offsets, improves quality of life and may have an attractive ICER in treating the severe allergic asthma population.",2006-01-02451,16968580,Curr Med Res Opin,S Dewilde,2006,22 / 9,1765-76,No,16968580,"S Dewilde; F Turk; M Tambour; T Sandström; The economic value of anti-IgE in severe persistent, IgE-mediated (allergic) asthma patients: adaptation of INNOVATE to Sweden, Curr Med Res Opin, 2006-Sep; 22(9):0300-7995; 1765-76",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Adding omalizumab to optimized standard therapy,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,56091,Euro,2004,95587.32

Lamivudine is effective but is limited by viral resistance. In contrast, adefovir and entecavir have lower viral resistance, but are more expensive. The most cost-effective approach is uncertain. METHODS: We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of six strategies in HBV cirrhosis: (1) No HBV treatment (""do nothing""), (2) lamivudine monotherapy, (3) adefovir monotherapy, (4) lamivudine with crossover to adefovir on resistance (""adefovir salvage""), (5) entecavir monotherapy, or (6) lamivudine with crossover to entecavir on resistance (""entecavir salvage""). The primary outcome was the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The ""do nothing"" strategy was least effective yet least expensive.

3358,Indications for CT scanning in mild traumatic brain injury: A cost-effectiveness study,"BACKGROUND: There is considerable uncertainty about the indications for cranial computed tomography (CT) scanning in patient with minor traumatic brain injury (TBI). This analysis involves an evidence-based comparison of several strategies for selecting patients for CT with regard to effectiveness and cost. METHODS: We performed a structured literature review of mild traumatic brain injury and constructed a cost-effectiveness model. The model estimated the impact of missed intracranial lesions on longevity, quality of life and costs. Using a 20-year-old patient for primary analysis, we compared the following strategies to screen for the need to perform a CT scan: observation in the emergency department or hospital floor, skull radiography, Selective CT based on the presence of additional risk factors and scanning all. RESULTS: Outcome measures for each strategy included average years of life, quality of life and costs. Selective CT and the CT All policy performed significantly better than the alternatives with respect to outcome. They were also less expensive in terms of total direct health care costs, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. The model yielded similar, but smaller, differences between the selective imaging and other strategies when run for older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of intracranial lesions, especially those that require surgery, is low in mild TBI, the consequences of delayed diagnosis are forbidding. Adverse outcome of an intracranial hematoma is so costly that it more than balances the expense of CT scans. In our cost-effectiveness model, the liberal use of CT scanning in mild TBI appears justified.",2006-01-02453,16966987,J Trauma,Sherman C Stein,2006,61 / 3,558-66,No,16966987,"Sherman C Stein; Mark G Burnett; Henry A Glick; Indications for CT scanning in mild traumatic brain injury: A cost-effectiveness study, J Trauma, 2006-Sep; 61(3):0022-5282; 558-66",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Selective CT screening based on the presence of additional risk factors,Not Stated,20 Years,20 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2005,Not Stated
3359,Implantable or external defibrillators for individuals at increased risk of cardiac arrest: where cost-effectiveness hits fiscal reality,"OBJECTIVES: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are highly effective at preventing cardiac arrest, but their availability is limited by high cost. Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are likely to be less effective, but also less expensive. We used decision analysis to evaluate the clinical and economic trade-offs of AEDs, ICDs, and emergency medical services equipped with defibrillators (EMS-D) for reducing cardiac arrest mortality. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of three strategies in adults meeting entry criteria for the MADIT II Trial: strategy 1, individuals experiencing cardiac arrest are treated by EMS-D; strategy 2, individuals experiencing cardiac arrest are treated with an in-home AED; and strategy 3, individuals receive a prophylactic ICD. The model was then used to quantify the aggregate societal benefit of these three strategies under the conditions of a constrained federal budget. RESULTS: Compared with EMS-D, in-home AEDs produced a gain of 0.05 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) at an incremental cost of $5225 ($104,500 per QALY), while ICDs produced a gain of 0.90 QALYs at a cost of $114,660 ($127,400 per QALY). For every $1 million spent on defibrillators, 1.7 additional QALYs are produced by purchasing AEDs (9.6 QALYs/$million) instead of ICDs (7.9 QALYs/$million). Results were most sensitive to defibrillator complication rates and effectiveness, defibrillator cost, and adults' risk of cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Both AEDs and ICDs reduce cardiac arrest mortality, but AEDs are significantly less expensive and less effective. If financial constraints were to lead to rationing of defibrillators, it might be preferable to provide more people with a less effective and less expensive intervention (in-home AEDs) instead of providing fewer people with a more effective and more costly intervention (ICDs).",2006-01-02458,16961547,Value Health,Peter Cram,2006,9 / 5,292-302,Yes,16961547,"Peter Cram; David Katz; Sandeep Vijan; David M Kent; Kenneth M Langa; A Mark Fendrick; Implantable or external defibrillators for individuals at increased risk of cardiac arrest: where cost-effectiveness hits fiscal reality, Value Health, 2006 Sep-Oct; 9(5):1098-3015; 292-302",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Treatment with in home automated external defibrillator (AED),Not Stated,65 Years,65 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,104500,United States,2004,143174.96

3361,Cost-utility analysis of routine neurosurgical spinal surgery,"OBJECT: Cost-utility analysis is currently the preferred method with which to compare the cost-effectiveness of various interventions. The authors conducted a study to establish the cost-utility results of routine neurosurgery-based spinal interventions by examining patient-derived values. METHODS: Two hundred seventy patients undergoing surgery for cervical or lumbar radicular pain filled in the 15-dimensional health-related quality of life (HRQOL) questionnaire before and 3 months after surgery. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the utility data and the expected remaining life years of the patients. The mean HRQOL score (scale, 0-1) increased after cervical surgery (169 patients, mean age 52 years, 40% women) from 0.81 +/- 0.11 preoperatively, to 0.85 +/- 0.11 at 3 months, and after lumbar surgery (101 patients, mean age 54 years, 59% women) from 0.79 +/- 0.10 preoperatively, to 0.85 +/- 0.12 at 3 months (p < 0.001). Of the 15 dimensions of health, improvement in the following was documented in both groups: sleeping, usual activities, discomfort and symptoms, depression, distress, vitality, and sexual activity (p < 0.05). The cost per QALY gained was Euro 2774 and 1738 for cervical and lumbar operations, respectively. In cases in which surgery was delayed the cost per QALY was doubled. CONCLUSIONS: Spinal surgery led to a statistically significant and clinically important improvement in HRQOL.

3363,"Hearing-impaired children in the United Kingdom, IV: cost-effectiveness of pediatric cochlear implantation","OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of pediatric cochlear implantation by conducting a cost-utility analysis from a societal perspective. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional survey, the parents of a representative sample of hearing-impaired children assessed the health utility of their child using a revised version of the Health Utilities Index Mark III questionnaire. Linear regression was used to estimate the gain in health utility associated with implantation while controlling for eight potentially confounding variables: average (4-frequency, unaided, preoperative) hearing level (AHL), age at onset of hearing-impairment, age, gender, number of additional disabilities, parental occupational skill level, ethnicity, and parental hearing status. The gain in health utility was accumulated to estimate the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) that would be gained from implantation over 15 yr and over a child's lifetime. The incremental societal cost of implantation, calculated in euros at 2001/2 levels, was estimated by summing the incremental costs of implantation that are incurred in the health sector, in the education sector, and by the child's family. The cost-effectiveness of cochlear implantation was estimated by calculating the incremental societal cost per QALY gained and was compared with an upper limit of acceptability of 50,000 euros per QALY. RESULTS: The parents of 403 implanted children, and 1863 nonimplanted children, completed the health utility questionnaire. Higher health utility was associated with a more favorable AHL, an older age at onset of hearing impairment, female gender, having fewer additional disabilities, having parents with a greater occupational skill level, white ethnicity, and implantation. The gain in health utility associated with implantation was estimated to be higher for children with a worse preoperative AHL and who were implanted when younger. Over 15 yr, for a child implanted at age 6 with a preoperative loss of 115 dB, 2.23 QALYs were estimated to be gained, compared with a mean incremental societal cost of 57,359 euros, yielding a mean cost per QALY of 25,629 euros. Cost-effectiveness was more favorable: (1) when estimated over a child's lifetime rather than 15 yr, (2) for children with a worse preoperative AHL, and (3) for children who were implanted when younger. CONCLUSIONS: The mean cost of gaining a QALY for the children in the present sample falls within acceptable limits. The strategy of giving highest priority for implantation to children with the greatest loss of hearing, and who are younger, maximizes benefit for a given cost.",2006-01-02465,16957506,Ear Hear,Garry R Barton,2006,27 / 5,575-88,No,16957506,"Garry R Barton; Paula C Stacey; Heather M Fortnum; A Quentin Summerfield; Hearing-impaired children in the United Kingdom, IV: cost-effectiveness of pediatric cochlear implantation, Ear Hear, 2006-Oct; 27(5):0196-0202; 575-88",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Cochlear implantation at an average age of 6 years,Not Stated,18 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,15 Years,3.00,3.00,25629,Euro,2002,34857.14
3364,Cost-effectiveness analysis of open colposuspension versus laparoscopic colposuspension in the treatment of urodynamic stress incontinence,"OBJECTIVES: To compare the cost effectiveness of laparoscopic versus open colposuspension for the treatment of female urinary stress incontinence. DESIGN: Cost utility analysis alongside a randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Six gynaecological surgical centres within the UK. POPULATION/SAMPLE: Women with proven stress urinary incontinence requiring surgery. METHODS: Open abdominal retropubic colposuspension or laparoscopic colposuspension carried out by experienced surgeons. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost, measured in pounds sterling and generic health-related quality of life, measured using the EQ-5D. The latter was used to estimate patient-specific quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Healthcare resource use over 6-month follow up translated into costs of pound 1805 for the laparoscopic arm and pound 1433 for the open arm (differential mean cost pound 372; 95% credibility interval [CrI]: 274-471). At 6 months, QALYs were slightly higher in the laparoscopic arm relative to the open arm (0.005; 95% CrI: -0.012 to 0.023). Therefore, the cost of each extra QALY in the laparoscopic group (the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER]) was pound 74,400 at 6 months. At 24 months, the laparoscopic arm again had a higher mean QALY score compared to the open surgery group. Thus, assuming that beyond 6 months the laparoscopic colposuspension would not lead to any significant additional costs compared with open colposuspension, the ICER was reduced to pound 9300 at 24 months. Extensive sensitivity analyses were carried out to test assumptions made in the base case scenario. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic colposuspension is not cost effective when compared with open colposuspension during the first 6 months following surgery, but it may be cost effective over 24 months.",2006-01-02466,16956333,BJOG,J C Dumville,2006,113 / 9,1014-22,No,16956333,"J C Dumville; A Manca; H C Kitchener; A R B Smith; L Nelson; D J Torgerson; Cost-effectiveness analysis of open colposuspension versus laparoscopic colposuspension in the treatment of urodynamic stress incontinence, BJOG, 2006-Sep; 113(9):1470-0328; 1014-22",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Laparoscopic colposuspension,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Female,Full,2 Years,Not Stated,3.50,9300,United Kingdom,2003,21383.28
3365,Cost-effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in older adults,"BACKGROUND: The Shingles Prevention Study showed that a varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine administered to adults 60 years of age or older reduced the incidence of herpes zoster from 11.12 to 5.42 cases per 1000 person-years. Median follow-up was 3.1 years, and relative risk reduction was 51.3% (95% CI, 44.2% to 57.6%). OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which clinical and cost variables influence the cost-effectiveness of VZV vaccination for preventing herpes zoster in immunocompetent older adults. DESIGN: Decision theoretical model. DATA SOURCES: English-language data published to March 2006 identified from MEDLINE on herpes zoster rates, vaccine effectiveness, quality of life, medical resource use, and unit costs. Target Population: Immunocompetent adults 60 years of age or older with a history of VZV infection. Time Horizon: Lifetime. Perspective: U.S. societal. Interventions: Varicella-zoster virus vaccination versus no vaccination. Outcome Measures: Incremental quality-adjusted survival and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Results of Base-Case Analysis: By reducing incidence and severity of herpes zoster, vaccination can increase quality-adjusted survival by 0.6 day compared with no vaccination. One scenario in which vaccination costs less than 100,000 dollars per QALY gained is when 1) the unit cost of vaccination is less than 200 dollars, 2) the age at vaccination is less than 70 years, and 3) the duration of vaccine efficacy is more than 30 years. Results of Sensitivity Analysis: Vaccination would be more cost-effective in ""younger"" older adults (age 60 to 64 years) than in ""older"" older adults (age > or =80 years). Longer life expectancy and a higher level of vaccine efficacy offset a lower risk for herpes zoster in the younger group. Other factors influencing cost-effectiveness include quality-of-life adjustments for acute zoster, unit cost of the vaccine, risk for herpes zoster, and duration of vaccine efficacy. LIMITATIONS: The effectiveness of VZV vaccination remains uncertain beyond the median 3.1-year duration of follow-up in the Shingles Prevention Study. CONCLUSIONS: Varicella-zoster virus vaccination to prevent herpes zoster in older adults would increase QALYs compared with no vaccination. Resolution of uncertainties about the average quality-of-life effects of acute zoster and the duration of vaccine efficacy is needed to better determine the cost-effectiveness of zoster vaccination in older adults.",2006-01-02467,16954357,Ann Intern Med,John Hornberger,2006,145 / 5,317-25,No,16954357,"John Hornberger; Katherine Robertus; Cost-effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia in older adults, Ann Intern Med, 2006-Sep-05; 145(5):1539-3704; 317-25",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Varicela-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,Not Stated,United States,2006,Not Stated
3366,Cost-effectiveness analysis of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty as an alternative to total knee arthroplasty for unicompartmental osteoarthritis,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty as an alternative to total knee arthroplasty in patients with degenerative arthritis limited to either the medial or lateral compartment. METHODS: A decision model was created for the treatment of end-stage unicompartmental knee arthritis. A literature review was used to identify possible outcomes and their probabilities following treatment with either unicompartmental or total knee arthroplasty. Each outcome was weighted for quality of life with use of a utility factor, and effectiveness was expressed in units of quality-adjusted life years. Gross costs were estimated from Medicare reimbursement data for the relevant Current Procedural Terminology and Diagnosis-Related Group codes. RESULTS: Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the cost-effectiveness of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty is dependent on the assumption that its durability and functional outcomes approach those of total knee arthroplasty. Specifically, it is necessary for the survival of unicompartmental implants to be within three to four years of the assumed survival of total knee implants for unicompartmental arthroplasty to remain a cost-effective alternative. Under these assumptions, the use of unicompartmental arthroplasty is a cost-effective choice as it results in incremental gains in effectiveness at a cost of less than US dollars 50,000 (in 1998 United States dollars) per quality-adjusted life year gained. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports unicompartmental knee arthroplasty as a cost-effective alternative for the treatment of unicompartmental arthritis when the durability and function of a unicompartmental replacement are assumed to be similar to those of a primary total knee replacement. This suggests that, with appropriate patient selection, the currently available literature supports unicompartmental arthroplasty as a cost-effective alternative to total knee arthroplasty.

3367,Cost-effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis with intermittent pneumatic compression at cesarean delivery,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of thromboprophylaxis at cesarean delivery with intermittent pneumatic compression. METHODS: A decision tree model using Markov analysis was developed to compare two approaches to perioperative care at the time of cesarean delivery: 1) no use of perioperative thromboprophylaxis and 2) the use of intermittent pneumatic compression for thromboprophylaxis at the time of cesarean delivery. Postcesarean deep venous thrombosis was estimated to occur in 0.7% of patients (75% of whom were asymptomatic), and result in a 9% chance of postthrombotic syndrome. Mechanical prophylaxis was assumed to decrease the risk of deep venous thrombosis by 70% and to cost 120 dollars. Probability of morbidity and mortality of venous thromboembolism as well as anticoagulation and the costs and utilities for different health state were derived from published studies. Sensitivity analysis was performed over a wide range of variable estimates. RESULTS: Using the assumptions in our base case, routine thromboprophylaxis for cesarean delivery cost 39,545 dollars per quality-adjusted life year. One-way sensitivity analysis revealed that as long as the incidence of postcesarean deep venous thrombosis was at least 0.68%, intermittent pneumatic compression reduced the incidence of deep venous thrombosis by at least 50%, or the cost of intermittent pneumatic compression was less than 180 dollars, the cost-effectiveness of mechanical prophylaxis did not exceed 50,000 dollars per quality-adjusted life year.

3371,17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for the prevention of preterm delivery: A cost-effectiveness analysis,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the use of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for the prevention of recurrent preterm deliveries is cost-effective. METHODS: Using decision-analysis modeling, we compared the cost-effectiveness of using 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate in four subgroups: 1) Prior preterm deliveries less than 32 weeks; 2) prior preterm deliveries 32-37 weeks; 3) prior term delivery; and 4) no prior delivery. Each subgroup was compared with a ""no treatment"" group. Costs included those for 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, hospital admissions, and complications from preterm deliveries. The main outcome measures include cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained and the number of preterm deliveries prevented. Secondary outcomes include neonatal complications prevented. One-way and multiway sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The use of 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate for the prevention of preterm deliveries result in cost-savings in women with prior preterm deliveries less than 32 weeks and 32-37 weeks.

3372,Cost-effectiveness analysis of computerized tomography in the routine follow-up of patients after primary treatment for Hodgkin's disease,"PURPOSE: To estimate the clinical benefits and cost effectiveness of computed tomography (CT) in the follow-up of patients with complete response (CR) after treatment for Hodgkin's disease (HD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate follow-up strategies for two hypothetical cohorts of 25-year-old patients with stage I-II or stage III-IV HD, treated with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine-based chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy, respectively. We compared three strategies for observing asymptomatic patients after CR: routine annual CT for 10 years, annual CT for 5 years, or follow-up with non-CT modalities only. We used Markov models to calculate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, and lifetime costs. Baseline probabilities, transition probabilities, and utilities were derived from published studies. Cost data were derived from the Medicare fee schedule and medical literature. We performed sensitivity analyses by varying baseline estimates. RESULTS: Annual CT follow-up is associated with minimal survival benefit. With adjustments for quality of life, we found a decrement in quality-adjusted life expectancy for early-stage patients followed with CT compared with non-CT modalities. Sensitivity analyses showed annual CT for 5 years becomes more effective than non-CT follow-up if the specificity of CT is 80% or more or if the disutility associated with a false-positive CT result is less than 0.01 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). For advanced-stage patients, annual CT for 5 years is associated with a very small quality-adjusted survival gain over non-CT follow-up with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 9,042,300 dollars/QALY.

3376,Which patients should receive aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease? An economic evaluation,"Low-dose aspirin is a standard care for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Its use in primary prevention is less widely accepted, however, despite recent meta-analyses and US and European guidelines supporting its use in individuals at increased CVD risk. The aim of this study was to define which patients should receive aspirin for primary prevention of CVD using data from four European countries. Based on the clinical data from two meta-analyses, a state-transition model was developed to compare the costs and effects of no treatment and low-dose aspirin as primary prevention for CVD over 10 years. The model was applied to patients at different 10-year risks (2-5%) of fatal CVD according to the SCORE equation. Direct costs from the perspective of the healthcare payer were used (base year 2003). Country-specific discounting was applied. Treating patients with a 10-year risk of fatal CVD of 2% or higher with low-dose aspirin resulted in lower total costs and more quality-adjusted life-years gained in the UK, Germany and Spain. In Italy, savings started at a 10-year fatal CVD risk of 3%. This difference was due to the higher cost of gastrointestinal bleeding in Italy. Monte Carlo analysis showed that aspirin was dominant in more than 90% of patients at a 10-year risk of 4% and 5% in the four countries.

3384,[Health economic evaluation of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease],"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Low-dose aspirin is standard treatment for patients with a history of cardiovascular disease. Its use in primary prevention is more controversial. However, recent studies also support the use of aspirin in high-risk individuals with no history of cardiovascular disease. This study investigated the health economic implications of using low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Spain. METHODS: A model was developed to predict the cost-effectiveness of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease over a period of 10 years. The direct costs used were those of the Spanish National Health Service (NHS). Results were expressed as cost per life-year gained and per quality-adjusted life-year gained. RESULTS. Administering low-dose aspirin to an individual with a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease > or =15% resulted in an average net saving of e 797 (95% CI, e 263-1331) over the 10-year period, with savings starting in the first year. For an annual risk > or =0.24%, this form of treatment would reduce NHS costs. Treating all at-risk individuals in the Spanish population with aspirin would save e 26.5 million from the healthcare budget, starting in the first year. CONCLUSIONS. Administering low-dose aspirin to individuals with a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease > or =15% would result in significant cost savings for the Spanish NHS. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of these findings.",2006-01-02480,16938230,Rev Esp Cardiol,Mark Lamotte,2006,59 / 8,807-15,No,16938230,"Mark Lamotte; Carme Piñol; Carlos Brotons; Lieven Annemans; Elena Guardiola; Thomas Evers; Maria Kubin; [Health economic evaluation of low-dose acetylsalicylic acid in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease], Rev Esp Cardiol, 2006-Aug; 59(8):0300-8932; 807-15",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Low-dose aspirin,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,10 Years,3.00,3.00,-19925,Euro,2003,-31727.2
3385,Patient self-management of anticoagulation therapy: a trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis,"Demand for anticoagulation management is increasing due to an expansion of clinical indications for therapy. One possible model of care to meet demand is patient self-management (PSM), beneficial to patients who need control over their condition. This study aimed to determine the cost and cost-effectiveness of PSM of anticoagulation compared with routine clinic-based care for patients receiving long-term anticoagulation. A cost-utility analysis was conducted alongside a randomised controlled trial; 617 patients were recruited and followed up for 12 months. There was no significant difference in mean quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) between groups - after adjusting for baseline, the mean difference in QALYs was 0.009 (95% CI, -0.012 to 0.030). Overall mean healthcare costs in the PSM arm were significantly higher at pounds sterling 417 (CI pounds sterling 394- pounds sterling 442) compared with pounds sterling 122 (CI pounds sterling 103- pounds sterling 144) in the control arm. Therefore, using a formal cost-effectiveness analysis, PSM of anticoagulation does not appear to be cost-effective. However, PSM may have other benefits in relieving pressure on traditional clinic-based care, and the cost-effectiveness of this model of care for some subgroups of anticoagulation patients needs to be explored further.",2006-01-02481,16938120,Br J Haematol,Sue Jowett,2006,134 / 6,632-9,No,16938120,"Sue Jowett; Stirling Bryan; Ellen Murray; Deborah McCahon; James Raftery; F D Richard Hobbs; David Fitzmaurice; Patient self-management of anticoagulation therapy: a trial-based cost-effectiveness analysis, Br J Haematol, 2006-Sep; 134(6):0007-1048; 632-9",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Patient Self Management (PSM) of anticoagulation,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,1 Year,Not Stated,Not Stated,31437,United Kingdom,2003,72282.38

3387,Cost-effectiveness of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis in France,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in France. METHODS: We used a decision tree to evaluate, from a society's perspective, the cost of PEP per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. We used 1999-2003 PEP surveillance data and literature-derived data on per event transmission probabilities, PEP efficacy and quality of life with HIV. HIV prevalence and lifetime cost of HIV/AIDS management in the HAART era were derived from French studies. We assumed that mean life expectancy in full health was 65 years among uninfected individuals and that the mean survival time after HIV infection was 22.5 years. The costs of PEP drugs and follow-up were derived from the French public sector. A 3% annual rate was used to discount future costs and effects. RESULTS: During 1999-2003, PEP was prescribed to 8958 individuals (heterosexual sex: 47.6%; homosexual sex: 28.4%; occupational exposure: 23.4%; drug injection: 0.6%); of those, 2143 were exposed to a known HIV-infected source. PEP was estimated to prevent 7.7 infections and saved 64.5 QALY at a net cost of euro 5.7 million, resulting in an overall cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 88,692 per QALY saved. PEP was cost saving for 4.4% of cases and cost effective (< euro 50,000 per QALY) in a further 11.3% of cases. In contrast, 72 and 52% of prescriptions had a cost-effectiveness ratio exceeding euro 200,000 and euro 2 millions, respectively, per QALY saved.

3396,Cost-effectiveness of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis in France,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in France. METHODS: We used a decision tree to evaluate, from a society's perspective, the cost of PEP per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) saved. We used 1999-2003 PEP surveillance data and literature-derived data on per event transmission probabilities, PEP efficacy and quality of life with HIV. HIV prevalence and lifetime cost of HIV/AIDS management in the HAART era were derived from French studies. We assumed that mean life expectancy in full health was 65 years among uninfected individuals and that the mean survival time after HIV infection was 22.5 years. The costs of PEP drugs and follow-up were derived from the French public sector. A 3% annual rate was used to discount future costs and effects. RESULTS: During 1999-2003, PEP was prescribed to 8958 individuals (heterosexual sex: 47.6%; homosexual sex: 28.4%; occupational exposure: 23.4%; drug injection: 0.6%); of those, 2143 were exposed to a known HIV-infected source. PEP was estimated to prevent 7.7 infections and saved 64.5 QALY at a net cost of euro 5.7 million, resulting in an overall cost-effectiveness ratio of euro 88,692 per QALY saved. PEP was cost saving for 4.4% of cases and cost effective (< euro 50,000 per QALY) in a further 11.3% of cases. In contrast, 72 and 52% of prescriptions had a cost-effectiveness ratio exceeding euro 200,000 and euro 2 millions, respectively, per QALY saved.
