5301,Costs and quality of life for prehabilitation and early rehabilitation after surgery of the lumbar spine,"During the recent years improved operation techniques and administrative procedures have been developed for early rehabilitation. At the same time preoperative lifestyle intervention (prehabilitation) has revealed a large potential for additional risk reduction. The aim was to assess the quality of life and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of standard care versus an integrated programme including prehabilitation and early rehabilitation. METHODS: The analyses were based on the results from 60 patients undergoing lumbar fusion for degenerative lumbar disease; 28 patients were randomised to the integrated programme and 32 to the standard care programme. Data on cost and health related quality of life was collected preoperatively, during hospitalisation and postoperatively. The cost was estimated from multiplication of the resource consumption and price per unit. RESULTS: Overall there was no difference in health related quality of life scores. The patients from the integrated programme obtained their postoperative milestones sooner, returned to work and soaked less primary care after discharge. The integrated programme was 1,625 euros (direct costs 494 euros + indirect costs 1,131 euros) less costly per patient compared to the standard care programme. CONCLUSION: The integrated programme of prehabilitation and early rehabilitation in spine surgery is more cost-effective compared to standard care programme alone.",2008-01-04445,18842157,BMC Health Serv Res,Per Rotbøll Nielsen,2008,8 /,209,Yes,18842157,"Per Rotbøll Nielsen; Jakob Andreasen; Mikael Asmussen; Hanne Tønnesen; Costs and quality of life for prehabilitation and early rehabilitation after surgery of the lumbar spine, BMC Health Serv Res, 2008; 8():1472-6963; 209",QALY,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Integrated program: extra resources vs. Standard of care program,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,6 Months,Not Stated,Not Stated,-52975,Euro,2006,-85438.58
5302,A multi-type HPV transmission model,"A prophylactic quadrivalent (types 6/11/16/18) vaccine against oncogenic and warts-causing genital Human papillomavirus (HPV) types was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2006. This paper presents a nonlinear, deterministic, age-structured, mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of HPV and disease occurrence in a US population stratified by gender and sexual activity group. The model can assess both the epidemiologic consequences and cost effectiveness of alternative vaccination strategies in a setting of organized cervical cancer screening in the United States. Inputs for the model were obtained from public data sources, published literature, and analyses of clinical trial data. The results suggest that a prophylactic quadrivalent HPV vaccine can: (i) substantially reduce the incidence of disease, (ii) increase survival among females, (iii) improve quality of life for both males and females, (iv) be cost-effective when administered to females age 12-24 years, and (v) be cost-effective when implemented as a strategy that combines vaccination of both females and males before age 12 vaccination with a 12 to 24 years of age catch-up vaccination program.",2008-01-04446,18841421,Bull Math Biol,Elamin H Elbasha,2008,70 / 8,2126-76,No,18841421,"Elamin H Elbasha; Erik J Dasbach; Ralph P Insinga; A multi-type HPV transmission model, Bull Math Biol, 2008-Nov; 70(8):1522-9602; 2126-76",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Routine prophylactic quadrivalent human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination of females before age 12 vs. No vaccination, screening only",Not Stated,Not Stated,12 Years,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,Not Stated,Not Stated,2964,United States,2005,3927.88

5307,A cost effectiveness study of integrated care in health services delivery: a diabetes program in Australia,"BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is rapidly growing as a proportion of the disease burden in Australia as elsewhere. This study addresses the cost effectiveness of an integrated approach to assisting general practitioners (GPs) with diabetes management. This approach uses a centralized database of clinical data of an Australian Division of General Practice (a network of GPs) to co-ordinate care according to national guidelines. METHODS: Long term outcomes for patients in the program were derived using clinical parameters after 5 years of program participation, and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Outcomes Model, to project outcomes for 40 years from the time of diagnosis and from 5 years post-diagnosis. Cost information was obtained from a range of sources. While program costs are directly available, and costs of complications can be estimated from the UKPDS model, other costs are estimated by comparing costs in the Division with average costs across the state or the nation. The outcome and cost measures are used derive incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. RESULTS: The clinical data show that the program is effective in the short term, with improvement or no statistical difference in most clinical measures over 5 years. Average HbA1c levels increased by less than expected over the 5 year period. While the program is estimated to generate treatment cost savings, overall net costs are positive. However, the program led to projected improvements in expected life years and Quality Adjusted Life Expectancy (QALE), with incremental cost effectiveness ratios of $A8,106 per life-year saved and $A9,730 per year of QALE gained. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of an established model of diabetes progression and generally available data has provided an opportunity to establish robust methods of testing the cost effectiveness of a program for which a formal control group was not available. Based on this methodology, integrated health care delivery provided by a network of GPs improved health outcomes of type 2 diabetics with acceptable cost effectiveness, which suggests that similar outcomes may be obtained elsewhere.",2008-01-04456,18834551,BMC Health Serv Res,Ian S McRae,2008,8 /,205,Yes,18834551,"Ian S McRae; James R G Butler; Beverly M Sibthorpe; Warwick Ruscoe; Jill Snow; Dhigna Rubiano; Karen L Gardner; A cost effectiveness study of integrated care in health services delivery: a diabetes program in Australia, BMC Health Serv Res, 2008; 8():1472-6963; 205",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Division-based program which coordinates information and provision of care via case managers and a centralized database of diabetic patients vs. Standard care and delivery,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,40 Years,5.00,5.00,9730,Australia,2005,9834.1
5308,The program cost and cost-effectiveness of screening men for Chlamydia to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease in women,"BACKGROUND: Because men transmit Chlamydia trachomatis to women, screening men to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease in women may be a viable strategy. However, the cost-effectiveness of this approach requires careful assessment. METHODS: Data from a demonstration project and longitudinal study that examined screening men for chlamydia were applied to a compartment-based transmission model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening men for chlamydia compared with alternative interventions, including expanded screening of women and combining disease investigation specialist-provided partner notification with screening. Cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and quality-adjusted life years lost were the primary outcome measures. A male screening program that screened 1% of men in the population annually was modeled. RESULTS: A program targeting high-risk men for screening (those with a larger number of partners in the previous year than the general population and a higher chlamydia prevalence) was cost saving compared with using equivalent program dollars to expand screening of lower-risk women. Combining partner notification with male screening was more effective than screening men alone. In sensitivity analyses, the male program was not always cost saving but averaged $10,520 per quality-adjusted life year saved over expanded screening of women. CONCLUSIONS: Screening men can be a cost-effective alternative to screening women, but the men screened must have a relatively high prevalence compared with the women to whom screening would be expanded (under baseline assumptions, the prevalence in screened men was 86% higher than that of screened women). These modeling results suggest that programs targeting venues that have access to high-risk men can be effective tools in chlamydia prevention.",2008-01-04459,18830137,Sex Transm Dis,Thomas L Gift,2008,35 / 11 Suppl,S66-75,No,18830137,"Thomas L Gift; Charlotte A Gaydos; Charlotte K Kent; Jeanne M Marrazzo; Cornelis A Rietmeijer; Julia A Schillinger; Eileen F Dunne; The program cost and cost-effectiveness of screening men for Chlamydia to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease in women, Sex Transm Dis, 2008-Nov; 35(11 Suppl):0148-5717; S66-75",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,"""Women with PN"": screening women for chlamydia with partner notification for women only vs. Screening 35% of women for chlamydia",Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,20 Years,3.00,3.00,96517,United States,2006,123907.05

5315,The program cost and cost-effectiveness of screening men for Chlamydia to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease in women,"BACKGROUND: Because men transmit Chlamydia trachomatis to women, screening men to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease in women may be a viable strategy. However, the cost-effectiveness of this approach requires careful assessment. METHODS: Data from a demonstration project and longitudinal study that examined screening men for chlamydia were applied to a compartment-based transmission model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of screening men for chlamydia compared with alternative interventions, including expanded screening of women and combining disease investigation specialist-provided partner notification with screening. Cases of pelvic inflammatory disease and quality-adjusted life years lost were the primary outcome measures. A male screening program that screened 1% of men in the population annually was modeled. RESULTS: A program targeting high-risk men for screening (those with a larger number of partners in the previous year than the general population and a higher chlamydia prevalence) was cost saving compared with using equivalent program dollars to expand screening of lower-risk women. Combining partner notification with male screening was more effective than screening men alone. In sensitivity analyses, the male program was not always cost saving but averaged $10,520 per quality-adjusted life year saved over expanded screening of women. CONCLUSIONS: Screening men can be a cost-effective alternative to screening women, but the men screened must have a relatively high prevalence compared with the women to whom screening would be expanded (under baseline assumptions, the prevalence in screened men was 86% higher than that of screened women).

5316,Pioglitazone versus rosiglitazone treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia: cost-effectiveness in the US,"OBJECTIVES: Pioglitazone hydrochloride (Actos) and rosiglitazone maleate (Avandia) are members of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of oral anti-diabetic drugs (OADs) and are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Greater beneficial effects on lipids have been demonstrated with pioglitazone, however. Study objectives were to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of pioglitazone compared to rosiglitazone in treating patients with T2DM and dyslipidemia, and determine the extent to which reported beneficial lipid effects of pioglitazone would improve clinical and economic outcomes through reduced macrovascular complications.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The validated CORE Diabetes Model (CDM) was used to simulate changes in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), complications, and direct medical costs. Baseline parameters came from a multi-center, double-blind trial comparing lipid and glycemic effects of pioglitazone (n = 400) and rosiglitazone (n = 402) among individuals with T2DM and untreated dyslipidemia. Sensitivity analyses examined the impact of cohort, clinical, and cost inputs on incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs).RESULTS: In the base case, pioglitazone was associated with mean (standard deviation [SD]) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of 7.476 (0.123) vs. 7.326 (0.128) for rosiglitazone. Pioglitazone had $3038 higher total direct costs, but $580 lower complication costs. Risks of four cardiovascular complications were reduced with pioglitazone (relative risks 0.860-0.942), while risks of 17 other complications were slightly higher (relative risks 1.001-1.056). The ICER for pioglitazone treatment was $20,171/QALY. Results were most sensitive to the effects of HbA(1c), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, overall lipid effects, and pioglitazone acquisition costs.CONCLUSIONS: Study limitations include issues of generalizability of the trial patient population, as well as inability to capture non-adherence and variation in 'real-world' treatment patterns. Nevertheless, pioglitazone (when compared to rosiglitazone) was found to have long-term value as a treatment option for T2DM patients with dyslipidemia treated within the US payer setting.",2008-01-04460,18826750,Curr Med Res Opin,Sandra Tunis,2008,/,,No,18826750,"Sandra Tunis; Michael Minshall; Meaghan Charles; Bhavik Pandya; Robert Baran; Pioglitazone versus rosiglitazone treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia: cost-effectiveness in the US, Curr Med Res Opin, 2008-Sep-29; ():0300-7995",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Pioglitazone vs. Rosiglitazone,Not Stated,Not Stated,19 Years,"Female, Male",Full,35 Years,3.00,3.00,20171,United States,2006,25895.22

METHODS: A Markov model was populated with probabilities of disease progression and survival from the published literature. Costs were obtained from diagnostic-related group weightings and health outcomes were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: Base case analyses suggested that, over a 20-year timeframe, the mean total cost per patient receiving WEX only was AU $23,182 with 10.45 life years (LY) and 9.90 QALYs. The mean cost per patient for WEX + SNB was AU $24,045 with 10.77 LY and 10.34 QALYs. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio for WEX + SNB was AU $2,770 per LY and AU $1,983 per QALY.

5318,Cost-effectiveness of specific subcutaneous immunotherapy in patients with allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma,"BACKGROUND: Specific immunotherapy is the only potentially curative treatment in patients with allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma. Health economic evaluations on this treatment, particularly in a German context, are sparse. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of specific subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) in addition to symptomatic treatment (ST) compared with ST alone in a German health care setting. METHODS: The analysis was performed as a health economic model calculation based on Markov models. In addition, we performed a concomitant expert board composed of allergy experts in pediatrics, dermatology, pneumology, and otolaryngology. The primary perspective of the study was societal. Additional sensitivity analyses were performed to prove our results for robustness. RESULTS: The SCIT and ST combination was associated with annual cost savings of Euro140 per patient. After 10 years of disease duration, SCIT and ST reach the breakeven point. The overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was Euro-19,787 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), with a range that depended on patient age (adults, Euro-22,196; adolescents, Euro-14,747; children, Euro-12,750). From a third-party payer's perspective, SCIT was associated with slightly additional costs. Thus, the resulting ICER was Euro8,308 per QALY for all patients.

5322,The value-based medicine comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of penetrating keratoplasty for keratoconus,"OBJECTIVE: To perform a base case, comparative effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness (cost-utility) analysis of penetrating keratoplasty for patients with severe keratoconus. METHODS: Visual acuity data were obtained from a large, retrospective multicenter study in which patients with keratoconus with less than 20/40 best corrected visual acuity and/or the inability to wear contact lenses underwent penetrating keratoplasty, with an average follow-up of 2.1 years. The results were combined with other retrospective studies investigating complication rates of penetrating keratoplasty. The data were then incorporated into a cost-utility model using patient preference-based, time trade-off utilities, computer-based decision analysis, and a net present value model to account for the time value of outcomes and money. The comparative effectiveness of the intervention is expressed in quality-of-life gain and QALYs (quality-adjusted life-years), and the cost-effectiveness results are expressed in the outcome of $/QALY (dollars spent per QALY). RESULTS: Penetrating keratoplasty in 1 eye for patients with severe keratoconus results in a comparative effectiveness (value gain) of 16.5% improvement in quality of life every day over the 44-year life expectancy of the average patient with severe keratoconus. Discounting the total value gain of 5.36 QALYs at a 3% annual discount rate yields 3.05 QALYs gained. The incremental cost for penetrating keratoplasty, including all complications, is $5934 ($5913 discounted at 3% per year). Thus, the incremental cost-utility (discounted at 3% annually) for this intervention is $5913/3.05 QALYs = $1942/QALY. If both eyes undergo corneal transplant, the total discounted value gain is 30% and the overall cost-utility is $2003. Surgery on the second eye confers a total discounted value gain of 2.5 QALYs, yielding a quality-of-life gain of 11.6% and a discounted cost-utility of $2238/QALY.

5325,The cost-utility of high dose oral mesalazine for moderately active ulcerative colitis,"BACKGROUND: Mesalazine (mesalamine) is standard first line treatment for moderately active ulcerative colitis (UC). Recently, doubling the mesalazine dose (Asacol 4.8 g/day) was shown to improve efficacy with no increase in adverse events. The cost-effectiveness of this strategy remains unknown. AIM: To assess the cost-utility of high dose (HD) mesalazine (Asacol 4.8 g/day) compared with standard dose (SD) mesalazine (Asacol 2.4 g/day) as first line treatment for moderately active UC. METHODS: The costs and benefits associated with a treatment pathway beginning with HD or SD mesalazine were determined over 12 weeks using a decision tree analytical model. RESULTS: A 12-week treatment pathway starting with HD mesalazine cost an average of 2382 pounds per patient compared with 2474 pounds for SD mesalazine and generated 0.0016 more quality adjusted life years (QALYs). HD mesalazine dominated SD mesalazine, being both more effective and less costly. HD mesalazine treatment resulted in fewer patients requiring surgery or hospitalization for intensive pharmacological treatment. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 72% chance that HD mesalazine was cost effective, based on a cost/QALY threshold of 30,000 pounds.

5326,Cost-effectiveness of group psychotherapy for depression in Uganda,"BACKGROUND: Low and middle-income countries are increasingly acknowledging the potential health and economic benefits associated with treatment of depression. To aid countries in making resource-allocation decisions, there is a need for cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for depression in developing countries. Although there are a limited number of studies from developing countries that report data on treatment efficacy and costs, these data can be leveraged to tailor mathematical models that are used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of depression treatments in specific settings. AIMS OF THE STUDY: Using data from depression studies in the published literature, as well as two studies in Uganda, we developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of group psychotherapy in the setting of Uganda. METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model of depression and evaluated the health benefits and costs associated with group psychotherapy with and without booster sessions for recurrent depressive episodes. We synthesized published data on the epidemiology of depression, treatment efficacy, and costs to parameterize our model, and used data from developing countries where available. Outcomes included quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALY), lifetime costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER). Costs were expressed in international dollars (I$) to facilitate comparisons across settings and studies. RESULTS: In Uganda, group psychotherapy without booster sessions decreased average number of depressive episodes by 6.2%, compared to no intervention; with booster sessions, reduction in number of episodes increased to 15.8%. Although group psychotherapy alone was less costly than psychotherapy with booster sessions, the ICER was higher, and therefore, group psychotherapy without booster sessions was dominated. The ICER associated with psychotherapy with booster sessions was I$ 1,150 per QALY, compared to no intervention. Although higher than previously published cost-effectiveness estimates of treatments for depression, HIV and cardiovascular disease in the developing world, the ICER of psychotherapy with booster sessions falls below Uganda's per-capita GDP, a suggested threshold for cost-effectiveness. The results were most sensitive to cost of the booster sessions and health state utility for depression. DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that group psychotherapy treatment with booster sessions for recurrent depressive episodes may be cost-effective in developing countries such as Uganda. These findings can assist in a global campaign for developing countries to provide and upscale appropriate depression treatment programs. However, there are only a limited number of studies on treatments for depression in the developing world with small numbers of enrolled subjects; most inputs to our Markov model relied on data from developed countries. Cultural, political, economic, and social differences between countries may limit the generalizability of our findings. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH CARE PROVISION AND USE: This study suggests a promising role for group psychotherapy in treating depression. Integration of this service into primary care may result in cost-effective treatment for depression. IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTH POLICIES: In developing countries with limited health care budgets, group psychotherapy can be a cost-effective treatment option for patients with depression.

5327,Cost-effectiveness of group psychotherapy for depression in Uganda,"BACKGROUND: Low and middle-income countries are increasingly acknowledging the potential health and economic benefits associated with treatment of depression. To aid countries in making resource-allocation decisions, there is a need for cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for depression in developing countries. Although there are a limited number of studies from developing countries that report data on treatment efficacy and costs, these data can be leveraged to tailor mathematical models that are used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of depression treatments in specific settings. AIMS OF THE STUDY: Using data from depression studies in the published literature, as well as two studies in Uganda, we developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of group psychotherapy in the setting of Uganda. METHODS: We developed a Markov cohort model of depression and evaluated the health benefits and costs associated with group psychotherapy with and without booster sessions for recurrent depressive episodes. We synthesized published data on the epidemiology of depression, treatment efficacy, and costs to parameterize our model, and used data from developing countries where available.

5328,Estimating the health benefits and costs associated with ezetimibe coadministered with statin therapy compared with higher dose statin monotherapy in patients with established cardiovascular disease: results of a Markov model for UK costs using data registries,"BACKGROUND: Ezetimibe has been reported to improve lipid control in patients with established cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the potential long-term impact on health status of prescribing ezetimibe in combination with statin therapy in patients with established CVD and evaluate its cost-effectiveness in a health economic model. METHODS: A Markov model was used to compare ezetimibe and statin combination therapy with statin monotherapy. A published relationship linking changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiovascular events was used to estimate the cardiovascular events avoided through lipid-lowering therapies. The model was populated using results of extensive literature searches and a meta-analysis of clinical evidence. An adjustment was applied to model second-line lipid-lowering benefits. Conservative assumptions were used to extend the patient pathway beyond the clinical evidence. The analysis took the perspective of the UK Department of Health; therefore, only direct costs were included. Costs were calculated as year-2006 British pounds. RESULTS: For a cohort of 1,000 hypothetical male patients aged 55 years, ezetimibe coadministered with current statin therapy was estimated to prevent a mean of 43 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 7 nonfatal strokes, and 26 cardiovascular deaths over a lifetime, compared with doubling the current statin dose. The events avoided would provide a mean of 134 additional quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). With a mean incremental cost of pound 3,693,000, the lifetime discounted cost per QALY gained would be pound 27,475 (95% CI, pound 27,331- pound 27,620) and would rise to pound 32,000 for men aged 75 years. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that, in some instances, ezetimibe coadministration may be cost-effective compared with statin monotherapy, but there are several limitations with this model. The economic effects of ezetimibe must be revisited when long-term effectiveness and safety data become available.",2008-01-04490,18803993,Clin Ther,Roberta Ara,2008,30 / 8,1508-23,Yes,18803993,"Roberta Ara; Abdullah Pandor; Indra Tumur; Suzy Paisley; Alejandra Duenas; Robert Williams; Anna Wilkinson; Paul Durrington; Jim Chilcott; Estimating the health benefits and costs associated with ezetimibe coadministered with statin therapy compared with higher dose statin monotherapy in patients with established cardiovascular disease: results of a Markov model for UK costs using data registries, Clin Ther, 2008-Aug; 30(8):1879-114X; 1508-23",QALY,United Kingdom,Not Stated,Not Stated,Ezetimibe with statin therapy vs. Higher dose statin monotherapy,Not Stated,55 Years,55 Years,Male,Full,Lifetime,3.50,3.50,27500,United Kingdom,2006,65078.39

5332,Community or patient preferences for cost-effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation: does it matter?,"BACKGROUND: Few healthcare economic evaluations, and none in cardiac rehabilitation, report results based on both community and patient preferences for health outcomes. We published the results of a randomized trial of cardiac rehabilitation after myocardial infarction in 1994 in which preferences were measured using both perspectives but only patient preferences were reported. This secondary analysis uses both types of preference measurements. METHODS: We collected community Quality of Well-Being (QWB) and patient Time Trade-off (TTO) preference scores from 188 patients (rehabilitation, n=93; usual care, n=95) on entry into the trial, at 2 months (end of the intervention) and again at 4, 8, and 12 months. Mean preference scores over the 12-month follow-up study period, estimates of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per patient, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [costs inflated to 2006 US dollars] and probabilities of the cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation for costs per QALY up to USD100,000 are reported. RESULTS: Mean QWB preference scores were lower (P<0.01) than the corresponding mean TTO preference scores at each assessment point. The 12-month changes in mean QWB and TTO preference scores were large and positive (P<0.001) with rehabilitation patients gaining a mean of 0.011 (95% confidence interval, -0.030 to +0.052) more QWB-derived QALYs, and 0.040 (-0.026, 0.107) more TTO-derived QALYs, per patient than usual care patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for QWB-derived QALYs was estimated at $60 270/QALY (about euro50 600/QALY) and at $16 580/QALY (about euro13 900/QALY) with TTO-derived QALYs. With a willingness to spend $100 000/QALY, the probability of rehabilitation being cost-effective is 0.58 for QWB-derived QALYs and 0.83 for TTO-derived QALYs.

5334,Economic burden of mucormycosis in the United States: can a vaccine be cost-effective?,"Mucormycosis is a life-threatening infection which causes unacceptably high morbidity and mortality despite treatment. Therefore, a vaccine to prevent mucormycosis is desirable. A major barrier to developing an anti-mucormycosis vaccine is the perception that such a vaccine would not be cost-effective to deploy because the disease is rare. We used data from a recent retrospective study to calculate the annual cost to the US healthcare system caused by mucormycosis infections. We created a model to estimate the cost-efficacy of a niche, anti-mucormycosis vaccine deployed in a targeted manner to high-risk patients. We found that each case of mucormycosis results in an average direct cost to the US healthcare system of $97,743, for an overall cost of mucormycosis of $50 million per year. In the base case scenario, targeted deployment of an anti-mucormycosis vaccine would result in a net cost per quality adjusted life year saved (QUALY) of $17,249. Variations in the price of the vaccine, its market penetration, or the cost of infection could dramatically decrease the net cost, and could even result in net savings per QUALY. In conclusion, mucormycosis causes considerable cost to the US health care system.

Patients entered the model with an IRLS score > 15 matching the trial inclusion criteria of the pramipexole trials. Resource use and utilities were based on trial data, literature, a patient survey and a panel of physicians from the UK and Sweden in the absence of published information. A healthcare sector perspective was taken for the UK and a societal perspective for Sweden using 2004-2005 unit costs. The base case analysis took a 1-year timeframe. RESULTS: In the UK the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for pramipexole was 3349 pounds sterling versus no treatment and a cost-saving of 92 pounds sterling against ropinirole. In Sweden, pramipexole produced cost-savings of Swedish Krona (SEK) 2381 (176 pounds sterling) versus no treatment and SEK 3564 (264 pounds sterling) against ropinirole. QALY gains in both countries were 0.095 versus no treatment and 0.007 versus ropinirole. Results compare well with UK cost-effectiveness thresholds of 20,000 pounds sterling/30,000 pounds sterling per QALY and are cost-saving for Sweden.

5342,The cost-effectiveness of HLA-B*5701 genetic screening to guide initial antiretroviral therapy for HIV,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of HLA-B*5701 testing to guide selection of first-line HIV regimens in the United States. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a simulation model of HIV disease. The prevalence of HLA-B*5701 and the probabilities of confirmed and unconfirmed severe systemic hypersensitivity reaction among patients taking abacavir testing HLA-B*5701 positive and negative were from the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of DNA Screening in a Clinical Trial study. The monthly costs of abacavir-based and tenofovir-based regimens were $1135 and $1139, respectively; similar virologic efficacy was assumed and this assumption was varied in sensitivity analysis. PATIENTS: Simulated cohort of patients initiating HIV therapy. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions are first-line abacavir, lamivudine, and efavirenz without pretreatment HLA-B*5701 testing; the same regimen with HLA-B*5701 testing; and first-line tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality-adjusted life years and lifetime medical costs discounted at 3% per annum, cost-effectiveness ratios ($/QALY). RESULTS: Abacavir-based treatment without HLA-B*5701 testing resulted in a projected 30.93 years life expectancy, 16.23 discounted quality-adjusted life years, and $472,200 discounted lifetime cost per person. HLA-B*5701 testing added 0.04 quality-adjusted months at an incremental cost of $110, resulting in a cost-effectiveness ratio of $36,700/QALY compared with no testing.

5345,Cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation to prevent age-related macular degeneration,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is a risk factor for age-related macular degeneration, but studies of ex-smokers suggest quitting can reduce the risk. METHODS: We fitted a function predicting the decline in risk of macular degeneration after quitting to data from 7 studies involving 1,488 patients. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation in terms of its impact on macular degeneration-related outcomes for 1,000 randomly selected U.S. smokers. We used a computer simulation model to predict the incidence of macular degeneration and blindness, the number of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and direct costs (in 2004 U.S. dollars) until age 85 years. Cost-effectiveness ratios were based on the cost of the Massachusetts Tobacco Control Program. Costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: If 1,000 smokers quit, our model predicted 48 fewer cases of macular degeneration, 12 fewer cases of blindness, and a gain of 1,600 QALYs. Macular degeneration-related costs would decrease by $2.5 million if the costs of caregivers for people with vision loss were included, or by $1.1 million if caregiver costs were excluded. At a cost of $1,400 per quitter, smoking cessation was cost-saving when caregiver costs were included, and cost about $200 per QALY gained when caregiver costs were excluded. Sensitivity analyses had a negligible impact. The cost per quitter would have to exceed $77,000 for the cost per QALY for smoking cessation to reach $50,000, a threshold above which interventions are sometimes viewed as not cost-effective.

5346,A Cost-Effectiveness Model Comparing Endovascular Repair to Open Surgical Repair of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms in Canada,"Objectives: The primary risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is rupture, which is associated with a high mortality rate. Elective surgical options for AAA include open repair (OR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). EVAR is less invasive than OR, and therefore may have less surgical risk than OR. However, the graft used for EVAR is much more expensive then the graft used for OR. Methods: A decision model with a 10-year time horizon was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of EVAR versus OR. The primary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The model incorporated the costs and benefits of both perioperative outcomes and postoperative outcomes. A systematic review was conducted to derive clinical outcome rates. Cost and utility model variables were based on various literature sources and data from a recent Canadian observational study. Parameter uncertainty was assessed using probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Results: In the base-case model, the incremental cost per QALY of EVAR was estimated to be $268,337, whereas the incremental cost per life-year was found to be $444,129. The incremental cost per QALY of EVAR remained above $295,715 under different assumptions of cohort age and model time horizon.

5347,Management of acute kidney injury in the intensive care unit: a cost-effectiveness analysis of daily vs alternate-day hemodialysis,"BACKGROUND: Although evidence suggests that a higher hemodialysis dose and/or frequency may be associated with improved outcomes, the cost-effectiveness of a daily hemodialysis strategy for critically ill patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) is unknown. METHODS: We developed a Markov model of the cost, quality of life, survival, and incremental cost-effectiveness of daily hemodialysis, compared with alternate-day hemodialysis, for patients with AKI in the intensive care unit (ICU). We employed a societal perspective with a lifetime analytic time horizon. We modeled the efficacy of daily hemodialysis as a reduction in the relative risk of death on the basis of data reported in the 2004 clinical trial published by Schiffl et al. We performed 1- and 2-way sensitivity analyses across cost, efficacy, and utility input variables. The main outcome measure was cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS: In the base case for a 60-year-old man, daily hemodialysis was projected to add 2.14 QALYs and $10,924 in cost. We found that the cost-effectiveness of daily hemodialysis compared with alternate-day hemodialysis was $5084 per QALY gained. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio became less favorable (>$50,000 per QALY gained) when the maintenance hemodialysis rate of the daily hemodialysis group was varied to more than 27% and when the difference in 14-day postdischarge mortality between the alternatives was varied to less than 0.5%.

STUDY DESIGN: Fractures, healthcare costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated over 10 years using a Markov model. METHODS: No therapy, risedronate, alendronate, ibandronate, and teriperatide (PTH) were compared among 4 risk groups. Sensitivity analyses examined the robustness of model results for 65-year-old women with low bone density and previous vertebral fracture. RESULTS: Women treated with a bisphosphonate experienced fewer fractures and more QALYs compared with no therapy or PTH. Total costs were lowest for the untreated cohort, followed by risedronate, alendronate, ibandronate, and PTH in all risk groups except women aged 75 years with previous fracture. The incremental cost-effectiveness of risedronate compared with no therapy ranged from cost saving for the base case to $66,722 per QALY for women aged 65 years with no previous fracture. Ibandronate and PTH were dominated in all risk groups. (A dominated treatment has a higher cost and poorer outcome.) Treating all eligible women with a bisphosphonate would cost an estimated additional $5563 million (21% total increase) and would result in 390,049 fewer fractures (35% decrease). In the highest risk group, the additional cost of therapy was offset by other healthcare cost savings.

5350,Therapies for treatment of osteoporosis in US women: cost-effectiveness and budget impact considerations,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis treatments for women at high fracture risk and estimate the population-level impact of providing bisphosphonate therapy to all eligible high-risk US women. STUDY DESIGN: Fractures, healthcare costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were estimated over 10 years using a Markov model. METHODS: No therapy, risedronate, alendronate, ibandronate, and teriperatide (PTH) were compared among 4 risk groups. Sensitivity analyses examined the robustness of model results for 65-year-old women with low bone density and previous vertebral fracture. RESULTS: Women treated with a bisphosphonate experienced fewer fractures and more QALYs compared with no therapy or PTH. Total costs were lowest for the untreated cohort, followed by risedronate, alendronate, ibandronate, and PTH in all risk groups except women aged 75 years with previous fracture. The incremental cost-effectiveness of risedronate compared with no therapy ranged from cost saving for the base case to $66,722 per QALY for women aged 65 years with no previous fracture. Ibandronate and PTH were dominated in all risk groups. (A dominated treatment has a higher cost and poorer outcome.) Treating all eligible women with a bisphosphonate would cost an estimated additional $5563 million (21% total increase) and would result in 390,049 fewer fractures (35% decrease).

5353,Health services utilization and cost utility analysis of a walking program for residential community elderly,"Promoting the health and improving the ability and confidence of the elderly to live independently can reduce health care expenditures and increase the health of society as a whole. However, the evidence to promote physical activity in order to promote health among the aged population is weak, especially in regards to the economic evaluation of a walking program. These researchers confirmed that the cost utility of a 12-week walking training program is acceptable. Therefore, an outpatient clinic-based walking program for older adults is worth promoting. Cost utility analysis is the critical evaluation method in exercise programs.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of surgery relative to nonoperative care among patients with a confirmed diagnosis of lumbar IDH. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The cost-effectiveness of surgery as a treatment for conditions associated with low back and leg symptoms remains poorly understood. METHODS: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, reported as discounted cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained in 2004 US dollars based on EuroQol EQ-5D health state values with US scoring, and information on resource utilization and time away from work.RESULTS: Among 775 patients who underwent surgery and 416 who were treated nonoperatively, the mean difference in QALYs over 2 years was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.16-0.25) in favor of surgery. Surgery was more costly than nonoperative care; the mean difference in total cost was $14,137(95% CI: $11,737-16,770).

5356,Cost-effectiveness of 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis,"OBJECTIVES: Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalamine) is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). The relative benefits and costs of maintenance 5-ASA therapy are uncertain. Our aims were to evaluate this strategy's potential cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to compare two strategies over 2 yr: (a) no maintenance 5-ASA, with 5-ASA 4.8 g/day given for flares, (b) maintenance 5-ASA 2.4 g/day, escalated and maintained at 4.8 g/day after the first flare. In both arms, the failure to induce remission led to other treatments, as needed: prednisone, parenteral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, 6-mercaptopurine, infliximab, and colectomy. RESULTS: Without maintenance 5-ASA, the mean flares per person were 1.92, and the mean cost per person was $3,402. With maintenance 5-ASA providing a relative risk of flare of 0.7 at 5-ASA cost of $198/month, flares per person decreased to 1.38 at a cost of $8,810/flare prevented. Maintenance 5-ASA increased discounted quality-adjusted life-years per person (QALYs per person) from 1.75 to 1.77 at a discounted cost of $224,000/QALY gained. The results were most sensitive to the flare risk reduction and cost of 5-ASA, the utilities of being in remission without or with 5-ASA, and the colectomy rates. At $15/month (the cost of sulfasalazine), maintenance 5-ASA cost $640/flare prevented and $16,300/QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Maintenance 5-ASA therapy decreases UC flares, but its cost may be substantial, depending on society's willingness to pay. If sulfasalazine can be tolerated and yields comparable benefits, sulfasalazine maintenance therapy is likely to be cost-effective.

5361,Cost-effectiveness of 5-aminosalicylic acid therapy for maintenance of remission in ulcerative colitis,"OBJECTIVES: Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, mesalamine) is effective in inducing and maintaining remission in ulcerative colitis (UC). The relative benefits and costs of maintenance 5-ASA therapy are uncertain. Our aims were to evaluate this strategy's potential cost-effectiveness. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to compare two strategies over 2 yr: (a) no maintenance 5-ASA, with 5-ASA 4.8 g/day given for flares, (b) maintenance 5-ASA 2.4 g/day, escalated and maintained at 4.8 g/day after the first flare. In both arms, the failure to induce remission led to other treatments, as needed: prednisone, parenteral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, 6-mercaptopurine, infliximab, and colectomy. RESULTS: Without maintenance 5-ASA, the mean flares per person were 1.92, and the mean cost per person was $3,402. With maintenance 5-ASA providing a relative risk of flare of 0.7 at 5-ASA cost of $198/month, flares per person decreased to 1.38 at a cost of $8,810/flare prevented. Maintenance 5-ASA increased discounted quality-adjusted life-years per person (QALYs per person) from 1.75 to 1.77 at a discounted cost of $224,000/QALY gained. The results were most sensitive to the flare risk reduction and cost of 5-ASA, the utilities of being in remission without or with 5-ASA, and the colectomy rates. At $15/month (the cost of sulfasalazine), maintenance 5-ASA cost $640/flare prevented and $16,300/QALY gained. CONCLUSION: Maintenance 5-ASA therapy decreases UC flares, but its cost may be substantial, depending on society's willingness to pay. If sulfasalazine can be tolerated and yields comparable benefits, sulfasalazine maintenance therapy is likely to be cost-effective.

5362,Cost-effectiveness of endovascular revascularization compared to supervised hospital-based exercise training in patients with intermittent claudication: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: The optimal first-line treatment for intermittent claudication is currently unclear. OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of endovascular revascularization vs supervised hospital-based exercise in patients with intermittent claudication during a 12-month follow-up period. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with patient recruitment between September 2002-September 2006 and a 12-month follow-up per patient. SETTING: A large community hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with symptoms of intermittent claudication due to an iliac or femoro-popliteal arterial lesion (293) who fulfilled the inclusion criteria (151) were recruited. Excluded were, for example, patients with lesions unsuitable for revascularization (iliac or femoropopliteal TASC-type D and some TASC type-B/C. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to endovascular revascularization (76 patients) or supervised hospital-based exercise (75 patients). MEASUREMENTS: Mean improvement of health-related quality-of-life and functional capacity over a 12-month period, cumulative 12-month costs, and incremental costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were assessed from the societal perspective. RESULTS: In the endovascular revascularization group, 73% (55 patients) had iliac disease vs 27% (20 patients) femoral disease. Stents were used in 46/71 iliac lesions (34 patients) and in 20/40 femoral lesions (16 patients). In the supervised hospital-based exercise group, 68% (51 patients) had iliac disease vs 32% (24 patients) with femoral disease. There was a non-significant difference in the adjusted 6- and 12-month EuroQol, rating scale, and SF36-physical functioning values between the treatment groups. The gain in total mean QALYs accumulated during 12 months, adjusted for baseline values, was not statistically different between the groups (mean difference revascularization versus exercise 0.01; 99% CI -0.05, 0.07; P = .73). The total mean cumulative costs per patient was significantly higher in the revascularization group (mean difference euro2318; 99% CI 2130 euros, 2506 euros; P < .001) and the incremental cost per QALY was 231 800 euro/QALY adjusted for the baseline variables. One-way sensitivity analysis demonstrated improved effectiveness after revascularization (mean difference 0.03; CI 0.02, 0.05; P < .001), making the incremental costs 75 208 euro/QALY. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there was no significant difference in effectiveness between endovascular revascularization compared to supervised hospital-based exercise during 12-months follow-up, any gains with endovascular revascularization found were non-significant, and endovascular revascularization costs more than the generally accepted threshold willingness-to-pay value, which favors exercise.",2008-01-04528,18771879,J Vasc Surg,Sandra Spronk,2008,48 / 6,1472-80,No,18771879,"Sandra Spronk; Johanna L Bosch; Pieter T den Hoed; Hermanus F Veen; Peter M T Pattynama; M G Myriam Hunink; Cost-effectiveness of endovascular revascularization compared to supervised hospital-based exercise training in patients with intermittent claudication: a randomized controlled trial, J Vasc Surg, 2008-Dec; 48(6):0741-5214; 1472-80",QALY,Netherlands,Not Stated,Not Stated,Endovascular revascularization vs. Supervised hospital-based exercise training,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,12 Months,3.00,Not Stated,231800,Euro,2005,382400.31

FVL screening, however, is not routinely performed before prescribing OCP, and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy is unknown. A decision tree model was constructed to evaluate FVL screening and prophylactic anticoagulation (AC) strategies in female relatives of FVL carriers.

5367,Decision-analytic evaluation of the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of management programmes in chronic heart failure,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: While management programmes (MPs) for chronic heart failure (CHF) are clinically effective, their cost-effectiveness remains uncertain. Thus, this study sought to determine the cost-effectiveness of MPs. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a Markov model to estimate life expectancy, quality-adjusted life expectancy, lifetime costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness of MPs as compared to standard care. Standard care was defined by the EuroHeart Failure Survey for Germany, MP efficacy was derived from our recent meta-analysis and cost estimates were based on the German healthcare system. For a population with a mean age 67 years (35% female) at onset of CHF, our model predicted an average quality-adjusted life expectancy of 2.64 years for standard care and 2.83 years for MP. MP yielded additional lifetime costs of euro1700 resulting in an incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of euro8900 (95% CI: dominant to 177,100) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the ICUR was sensitive to age and sex. CONCLUSION: MPs increase life expectancy in patients with CHF by an average of 84 days and increase lifetime cost of care by approximately euro1700.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A decision model was developed to compare the cost effectiveness at 7-, 11.5-, and 35-year horizons of intravenous carboplatin and paclitaxel (IV-CARBO/PAC), intravenous cisplatin and paclitaxel (IV-CIS/PAC), or intravenous paclitaxel followed by intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel (IP-CIS/PAC). Survival data were from women participating in representative Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) protocols. Medicare reimbursement rates and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Database were used to estimate costs for treatment regimens and grade 3 to 4 adverse effects, respectively. RESULTS: Median predicted survival was 66, 57, 51, and 48 months for IP-CIS/PAC, IV-CARBO/PAC, IV-CIS/PAC (GOG 172), or IV-CIS/PAC (GOG 158), respectively. Across a range of analyses, IV-CIS/PAC was more costly and had lower life expectancy than IV-CARBO/PAC. Compared with IV-CARBO/PAC, IP-CIS/PAC had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $180,022 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved at a 7-year time horizon, $71,835/QALY at 11.5 years, and $32,053/QALY over a lifetime. Extending the survival advantage of IP-CIS/PAC over 11.5 years and a lifetime results in ICERs of $26,249 and $23,973, respectively.

Nevertheless, for numerous medical procedures, little data are available on the cost per QALY gained. The aim of the present study was to calculate the cost per QALY gained with primary hip and knee replacement and to compare the result with the cost per QALY for other medical procedures, as well as with the maximum threshold cost considered acceptable in Spain. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort pre-test/post-test study of patients undergoing primary hip or knee arthroplasty. Age, sex, and clinical variables were recorded. Functional status and quality of life were measured by means of the WOMAC and EuroQol instruments, respectively, before the intervention and 6 months later. The direct costs of the intervention were calculated, with length of hospital stay and the prosthesis as the main cost drivers. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients, 40 from each intervention, were included in this study. Both functional and perceived health status improved after the intervention. The number of QALYs gained in the knee cohort was 4.64, while that in the hip cohort was 0.86.

5372,Economic evaluation of posaconazole vs. standard azole prophylaxis in high risk neutropenic patients in the Netherlands,"BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients experience prolonged neutropenia after treatment with intensive chemotherapy, leading to a high risk of invasive fungal infections (IFI). The present study evaluates the cost effectiveness of posaconazole vs. standard azoles for the prevention of IFIs in neutropenic patients in the Netherlands. METHODS: A decision-tree model was developed using data from a randomized trial that compared posaconazole and standard azole (fluconazole or itraconazole) prophylaxis in neutropenic patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for AML/MDS (Cornely et al., N Engl J Med 2007;356:348-359). Following initiation of prophylaxis, clinical events are modeled with chance nodes reflecting probabilities of IFIs, IFI-related death, and death from other causes. Patients surviving the prophylaxis are assumed to have a life expectancy according to the underlying condition. This allows translation of the trial outcomes to a lifetime horizon. Data on life expectancy, quality of life, medical resource consumption and costs were obtained from the literature. Model outcomes include cost per life year (LY) gained and cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained. RESULTS: The total cost (treatment of breakthrough IFI + prophylaxis) for posaconazole amounted to 4412 euros (95% uncertainty interval 3403 euros - 5666 euros), which is -183 euros (-1985 euros to 1564 euros) less than costs with standard azoles. Posaconazole prophylaxis resulted in 0.08 (0.02-0.15) QALYs gained in comparison with prophylaxis with standard azoles. Results from a probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicate that there is a 90% probability that the cost per QALY gained with posaconazole is below 20,000 euros. Additional scenario analyzes with different assumptions confirmed these findings.

5376,Modeling the impact of HIV chemoprophylaxis strategies among men who have sex with men in the United States: HIV infections prevented and cost-effectiveness,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: HIV chemoprophylaxis may be a future prevention strategy to help control the global epidemic of HIV/AIDS. Safety and efficacy trials of two agents are currently underway. We assess the expected number of HIV cases prevented and cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical HIV chemoprophylaxis program among men who have sex with men in a large US city. DESIGN AND METHODS: We developed a stochastic compartmental mathematical model using HIV/AIDS surveillance data to simulate the HIV epidemic and the impact of a 5-year chemoprophylaxis program under varying assumptions for epidemiological, behavioral, programmatic and cost parameters. We estimated program effectiveness and costs from the perspective of the US healthcare system compared with current HIV prevention practices. The main outcome measures were number of HIV infections prevented and incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-years saved. RESULTS: A chemoprophylaxis program targeting 25% of high-risk men who have sex with men in New York City could prevent 780 (4%) to 4510 (23%) of the 19 510 HIV infections predicted to occur among all men who have sex with men in New York City in 5 years. More than half of prevented infections would be among those not taking chemoprophylaxis but who benefit from reduced HIV prevalence in the community. Under base-case assumptions, incremental cost was US$ 31 970 per quality-adjusted life-years saved. The program was cost-effective under most variations in efficacy, mechanism of protection and adherence. CONCLUSION: HIV chemoprophylaxis among high-risk men who have sex with men in a major US city could prevent a significant number of HIV infections and be cost-effective.",2008-01-04551,18753932,AIDS,Kamal Desai,2008,22 / 14,1829-39,No,18753932,"Kamal Desai; Stephanie L Sansom; Marta L Ackers; Scott R Stewart; H Irene Hall; Dale J Hu; Rachel Sanders; Carol R Scotton; Sada Soorapanth; Marie-Claude Boily; Geoffrey P Garnett; Peter D McElroy; Modeling the impact of HIV chemoprophylaxis strategies among men who have sex with men in the United States: HIV infections prevented and cost-effectiveness, AIDS, 2008-Sep-12; 22(14):0269-9370; 1829-39",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Chemoprophylaxis once daily self-administered vs. No chemoprophylaxis,Not Stated,Not Stated,Not Stated,Male,Full,5 Years,3.00,3.00,31970,United States,2006,41042.6
5377,Cost-effectiveness of tipranavir in treatment-experienced HIV patients in the United States,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the estimated long-term outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of tipranavir boosted with ritonavir (TPV/r) versus investigator-selected ritonavir-boosted comparator protease inhibitor (CPI/r) using the observed 48-week data from the RESIST trials in a previously published Markov model. METHOD: A previously developed 3-stage Markov model was modified to reflect US practice patterns for treatment-experienced HIV patients using 2007 costs and combined phase III tipranavir trial data (RESIST-1 and -2). The 12 model health states were defined by CD4 cell count and viral load that have previously been identified as predictors of HIV/AIDS progression. Resource use and quality of life weights were linked to each health state. Disease progression beyond the 48-week trial period was based on HAART treatment-experienced patients from data collected by the University of South Carolina. Costs were estimated from the payer perspective. RESULTS: TPV/r patients remained longer in health states defined by higher CD4 cell count and lower viral load compared to CPI/r patients. This reduced the rate of AIDS-defining events by 12.35% over 5 years and resulted in 0.64 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained (discounted at 3%) over the model time horizon (remaining lifetime). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of TPV/r versus CPI/r was $56,517/QALY (discounted at 3%). Excluding patients also treated with enfuvirtide reduced the ICER to $46,147/QALY.

5378,A model of the long-term cost effectiveness of scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab for moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis,"BACKGROUND: Infliximab (IFX) has been shown to be efficacious in moderate-severe ulcerative colitis (UC). Aim To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a scheduled maintenance treatment (SMT) with IFX in moderate-severe UC patients. METHODS: A Markov model was constructed to simulate the progression of a cohort of moderate-severe UC patients treated with IFX (5 mg/kg) SMT. Transitions were estimated from two phase III trials of IFX (ACT I and ACT II). Standard care, comprising immunomodulators and/or corticosteroids was used as a comparator. Two separate treatment strategies were evaluated - continued treatment in IFX responders and continued treatment in IFX patients achieving remission. The dose of IFX was estimated for a 73 kg typical UC patient in the UK. The results were calculated over 10 years using a discount rate of 3.5% for costs and outcomes. The outcome measure was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) estimated using EQ-5D. Sensitivity analyses explored the uncertainty around the results. RESULTS: The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for IFX was 27,424 pounds in the responder strategy and 19,696 pounds in the remission strategy at 10 years.

5380,Cost-effectiveness of hearing aids in the hearing-impaired elderly: a probabilistic approach,"OBJECTIVE: Hearing aids are the principal tool for rehabilitation of hearing loss, one of the most prevalent impairments among elderly adults, but cost-utility ratings for hearing aid use are limited. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING AND PATIENTS: A multistate Markov model was constructed to model 50- to 80-year-old patients moving between states, including normal hearing, mild, moderate, or severe hearing loss. Parameters assigned in the model are partly derived from the Medline source (1966-2005) and partly from data on hearing-impaired elders (n = 96) in a tertiary care center in Taiwan. To address uncertainty, most of the parameters were specified by distributions, rather than base-case values. A probabilistic approach with Monte Carlo simulations was performed to produce an acceptability curve, showing the probabilities of being cost-effective given threshold values of willingness to pay (WTP). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hearing-related quality-adjusted life-years and cost in US dollars and Euros. RESULTS: The incremental costs for gaining an additional hearing-related quality-adjusted life-years in women and men were US $13,615 (Euro 10,826) and 9,702 (Euro 7,715), respectively. The probability of being cost-effective increased to 53% in women and 65% in men given a WTP of US $12,000 (Euro 9,542). The probabilities of being cost-effective to reach plateau were 67% for women and 78% for men given a WTP of US $20,000 (Euro 15,904).

5382,Tamoxifen for breast cancer risk reduction: impact of alternative approaches to quality-of-life adjustment on cost-effectiveness analysis,"BACKGROUND: In cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), the effects of health-care interventions on multiple health dimensions typically require consideration of both quantity and quality of life. OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of alternative approaches to quality-of-life adjustment using patient preferences (utilities) on the outcome of a CEA on use of tamoxifen for breast cancer risk reduction. RESEARCH DESIGN: A state transition Markov model tracked hypothetical cohorts of women who did or did not take 5 years of tamoxifen for breast cancer risk reduction. Incremental quality-adjusted effectiveness and cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for models including and excluding a utility adjustment for menopausal symptoms were compared with each other and to a global utility model. SUBJECTS: Two hundred fifty-five women aged 50 and over with estimated 5-year breast cancer risk >or=1.67% participated in utility assessment interviews. MEASURES: Standard gamble utilities were assessed for specified tamoxifen-related health outcomes, current health, and for a global assessment of possible outcomes of tamoxifen use. RESULTS: Inclusion of a utility for menopausal symptoms in the outcome-specific models substantially increased the ICER; at the threshold 5-year breast cancer risk of 1.67%, tamoxifen was dominated. When a global utility for tamoxifen was used in place of outcome-specific utilities, tamoxifen was dominated under all circumstances.

SUBJECTS: Two hundred fifty-five women aged 50 and over with estimated 5-year breast cancer risk >or=1.67% participated in utility assessment interviews. MEASURES: Standard gamble utilities were assessed for specified tamoxifen-related health outcomes, current health, and for a global assessment of possible outcomes of tamoxifen use. RESULTS: Inclusion of a utility for menopausal symptoms in the outcome-specific models substantially increased the ICER; at the threshold 5-year breast cancer risk of 1.67%, tamoxifen was dominated. When a global utility for tamoxifen was used in place of outcome-specific utilities, tamoxifen was dominated under all circumstances.

5394,The psoriatic arthritis cost evaluation study: a cost-of-illness study on tumour necrosis factor inhibitors in psoriatic arthritis patients with inadequate response to conventional therapy,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate costs, benefits and cost-effectiveness of anti-TNF agents in PsA patients with inadequate response to conventional treatment. METHODS: A total of 107 patients, from nine Italian rheumatology centres, with different forms of PsA were given anti-TNF treatment, mainly etanercept (87%). Information on resource use, health-related quality of life, disease activity, function and laboratory values were collected at baseline and through out the 12 months of therapy. Cost (expressed in euro 2007) and utility (measured by EuroQol) before and after anti-TNF therapy initiation were compared in order to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, and cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was calculated. RESULTS: At the end of 12 months, there was a significant increase in direct cost due to an increase of drug cost caused by TNF inhibitors that was only partially offset by the decrease in indirect cost. In the last 6 months of therapy, the direct cost increased by euro5052, the cost for the National Health System (NHS) by euro5044 and the social cost by euro4638. However, a gain of 0.12 QALY resulted in a cost per QALY gained of euro40 876 for the NHS and of euro37 591 for the society. The acceptability curve showed that there would be a 97% likelihood that anti-TNF therapy would be considered cost-effective at willingness-to-pay threshold of euro60 000 per QALY gained.

5396,Cost-effectiveness of the Australian National Tobacco Campaign,"BACKGROUND: The Australian National Tobacco Campaign (NTC) was an intensive mass media anti-smoking campaign, the first phase of which commenced in 1997, cost around $A9 million, and reduced smoking prevalence by 1.4%. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of phase one of the NTC, which ran from June to November 1997. Design and study population: The quit benefits model (QBM), a Markov-cycle simulation model was used to predict the benefits of smoking cessation for the estimated 190 000 quitters from the time of quitting until death, censored at age 85 years. Measures of effectiveness were cases of lung cancer, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) avoided; deaths prevented, and life-years and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. The savings in healthcare costs through prevention of the four specified smoking-associated diseases were estimated. Future costs, life-years and QALYS were discounted at 3% per year. RESULTS: The QBM predicted that the NTC avoided over 32 000 cases of COPD, 11 000 cases of AMI, 10 000 cases of lung cancer, and 2500 cases of stroke. Prevention of around 55 000 deaths, gains of 323 000 life-years and 407 000 QALYs, and healthcare cost savings of $A740.6 million were predicted. The NTC was therefore both cost saving and effective. CONCLUSIONS: As well as reducing smoking prevalence, the NTC was unequivocally cost-effective.",2008-01-04566,18719075,Tob Control,S F Hurley,2008,17 / 6,379-84,No,18719075,"S F Hurley; J P Matthews; Cost-effectiveness of the Australian National Tobacco Campaign, Tob Control, 2008-Dec; 17(6):1468-3318; 379-84",QALY,Australia,Not Stated,Not Stated,Smoking cessation campaign vs. Usual care/behavior,Not Stated,84 Years,Not Stated,"Female, Male",Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,-1796.6,Australia,2001,-1357.25
5397,Health and economic implications of HPV vaccination in the United States,"BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of prophylactic vaccination against human papillomavirus types 16 (HPV-16) and 18 (HPV-18) is an important consideration for guidelines for immunization in the United States. METHODS: We synthesized epidemiologic and demographic data using models of HPV-16 and HPV-18 transmission and cervical carcinogenesis to compare the health and economic outcomes of vaccinating preadolescent girls (at 12 years of age) and vaccinating older girls and women in catch-up programs (to 18, 21, or 26 years of age). We examined the health benefits of averting other HPV-16-related and HPV-18-related cancers, the prevention of HPV-6-related and HPV-11-related genital warts and juvenile-onset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis by means of the quadrivalent vaccine, the duration of immunity, and future screening practices. RESULTS: On the assumption that the vaccine provided lifelong immunity, the cost-effectiveness ratio of vaccination of 12-year-old girls was $43,600 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained, as compared with the current screening practice. Under baseline assumptions, the cost-effectiveness ratio for extending a temporary catch-up program for girls to 18 years of age was $97,300 per QALY; the cost of extending vaccination of girls and women to the age of 21 years was $120,400 per QALY, and the cost for extension to the age of 26 years was $152,700 per QALY. The results were sensitive to the duration of vaccine-induced immunity; if immunity waned after 10 years, the cost of vaccination of preadolescent girls exceeded $140,000 per QALY, and catch-up strategies were less cost-effective than screening alone. The cost-effectiveness ratios for vaccination strategies were more favorable if the benefits of averting other health conditions were included or if screening was delayed and performed at less frequent intervals and with more sensitive tests; they were less favorable if vaccinated girls were preferentially screened more frequently in adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of HPV vaccination will depend on the duration of vaccine immunity and will be optimized by achieving high coverage in preadolescent girls, targeting initial catch-up efforts to women up to 18 or 21 years of age, and revising screening policies.",2008-01-04572,18716299,N Engl J Med,Jane J Kim,2008,359 / 8,821-32,No,18716299,"Jane J Kim; Sue J Goldie; Health and economic implications of HPV vaccination in the United States, N Engl J Med, 2008-Aug-21; 359(8):1533-4406; 821-32",QALY,United States of America,Not Stated,Not Stated,Routine vaccination and current screening vs. Screening,Not Stated,12 Years,12 Years,Female,Full,Lifetime,3.00,3.00,43600,United States,2006,55973.01
